0,3,The vinyl is good but there is no background. The image description is misleading. It is white vinyl there is no background at all. It is a good decal though I just adapted and rolled with it. Still looks good and seems durable. Need to get that image changed though.
1,2,Too bluky
2,5,My husband loves it.
3,3,"Ok for the price, I guess.  These are pretty narrow and sleek.  Installed on 1997 F150 4x4 supercab.  They could certainly use another support in the middle somewhere.  I go about 150lbs and they work fine for me.  If I were heavier, I would be concerned about durability."
4,5,Used these connectors to make a winch connection from the rear bumper of my truck to the winch on my trailer.
5,5,Great oil filter. Made of great quality. fits my saturn S-series perfectly and larger then the stock filter so you can hold more oil
6,5,Good product.  Great seller!
7,5,Great deal great quality I even muffed one up laying it but as I carded it it layed flat all on its own!
8,5,Great product works great in my MX5
9,5,Very nice pack.
10,5,"All I can say about these is they work very well and have a blueish tint to the light, very slight though."
11,5,"I laid down my bike the other day unfortunately. Fortunately tho I was wearing this helmet, here's my story. I hit a cutout patch in the road and lost traction, and my front wheel turned sharply on me ( going about 40mph ) it all happened so fast I could not correct it. I went down shoulder then head first into the pavement. The helmet stayed firm on my head. The aftermath of it all was cracked and broken fairings, road rash on my shoulder elbows, knees, lower back, and possibly a broken knee. ( doctor could not determine due to the amount of swelling ) but the important thing is that I'm here to tell you all this. And for the money spent for this helmet it was worth more than what is asked. Highly suggest this helmet for anyone who rides!"
12,5,"Quiet smooth braking, everything needed for a good installation."
13,5,"Very cool, using in my old Jeep for the trailer brake."
14,5,excellent
15,5,"Nice and bigger than I thought.  Colors are rich, nice quality."
16,5,Excellent.
17,5,Perfect fit makes old remote look almost new.
18,5,Plug & play which can't be beat!
19,5,just as advertized.  a great addition at a very low price
20,1,The adhesive was terrible and I threw it away after 3 days it was hanging down
21,4,"Happy with it , fit ni e and pretty easy to install ."
22,5,I bought it a month ago and its been working fine. And it arrived real fast.
23,5,Gift for my girlfriend who is a hello kitty fan and she loves the mats.
24,5,Fast shipping and great price
25,4,Excellent
26,5,"I am happy with the product, they arrived early and are even better than described.  Thank you."
27,5,Nice to be able to use the Battery Tender connector when the bike is in use rather than just when it is parked.  Works well.
28,5,"Delivered on time. Noticed better performance over traditional spark plugs. Not a whole lot, but noticeable."
29,5,fits my car real nice
30,5,Perfect for Chevrolet
31,5,My boyfriend loves this sticker and put it on his truck as soon as I gave it to him.  It just needs the words &#34;I believe&#34; below it.
32,5,works great.
33,4,This is a great little portable receiver.  We do a lot of camping and use one of our home receivers and it works great!  The only down side is that it is only Standard Definition with Direct TV receivers - HD receiver will NOT work with this dish.
34,4,Great product went on very easy
35,4,first one was a dud the replacement works great in my coat closet
36,5,"Surpassed my expectations, excellent measure for my corolla 2013 ring 16"
37,5,Perfect for working on cars
38,4,Good and heavy duty atv receiver hitch.  I have pulled a 4x8 utility trailer through a clear cut field using my Grizzly 700.  The trailer  had two men riding in it as well as a deer feeder and 250 lbs of corn.  I drove over stumps and small logs and this hitch held up very nicely to the punishment.  (it was a very rough ride to those to men riding in the trailer)  I even crossed a deep ditch and bottomed out the trailer and had to put the atv in 4x4 and spun all 4 tires to get it free.
39,5,Muy buenos
40,4,"Likes: Tool-less installation that allows it to be moved easily and quickly from bike to bike. Ability to recharge via USB cord (same mini USB plug used by most phones and many other devices). Seemingly sturdy construction. (Disclaimer: Have yet to test the sturdiness factor). Reasonable price.  Dislikes: Can't see any difference in brightness between the low and high settings. However, I always run my taillight on the blinking setting for better visibility, so the other settings aren't a big deal.  Update: My light recently popped off the rubber strap and disappeared while transporting the bike on a car carrier, leaving the strap connected to the seat post. Definitely a poor design feature. I'll be replacing the light with something else."
41,1,Don't buy these cheap pieces of crap. Installed them like I've done 100's of bearings and they fell apart when I stuck the assembly onto the axle. we'll see if I get my money back.
42,5,Works perfectly and replaced a 6 year old VDO replacement.  Blows hard and strong ... not noisy.
43,3,"There is no elastic or rope included. Mine had to be cut to fit a 205/15 tire. Be prepared. Otherwise, ok."
44,3,glue didn't stick it very well despite following all the instructions
45,5,"These fit great and really decreased the noise under the hood. The extra material and rigidity of the flange allows the gasket to work as it should. I replaced a set of long headers that just sat too low under the car and were causing heat problems with the starter and several fluid lines and required several mods to clear other components. These fit and work great. The application is a second gen Camaro with an LS1 in it. The outlet flanges are stainless steel so I did need to make some steel version to weld to my exhaust since I didn't have the capability to weld steel to stainless. The doughnut gaskets are also a little hard to find as I could only find them online, but they seal great."
46,5,Sounds awesome!!
47,5,Fits and looks amazing!
48,5,"As with most DORMAN products, they fit and perform as good or better than OEM. These bottles cloud easily and are hard to clean due to the baffle inside. This product will make it much easier to see the level of your coolant. The pressure cap and level sensor are included. This is for the version that clips in, not bolt in version. 06 Malibu Maxx SS, 3.9l"
49,5,Love my lights bright works well easy to install.
50,5,fast shipping and quality part. fit my 2000 e320<br /><br />Great customer service.
51,5,"Well made heavy fabric, these car seat covers are exactly as shown in the photo. They are well worth the money, as they will last for many years to come. They've been on my seats for 4 months & still look brand new."
52,5,Very cute. Very happy with it. Delivery time was 2 days. Lover Amazon
53,5,"Good product, meet expectations and delivery was on time<br />Thank you"
54,5,"Easy setup, fast shipping, and good price."
55,5,"Super-easy to install. Came with all bulbs already in place, which was a nice surprise. A very good bargain. Shipping was fast and efficient."
56,5,"I had one of these years ago and always loved it.  Somehow I lost it and now ordered another one.  Keeps my loose coins organized in my car for quick access at drive-thrus.  Keeps several nickles, dimes, and quarters in the spring loaded top. Also has a bottom storage to keep pennies and any extra coins. Best of all, it fits perfectly in any cup holder."
57,5,this thing saved me so much time.  My brother and I spent days trying to get the bearings out of an old bike.  This took literally 30 seconds per tire and was flawless.
58,4,"No issues, seems to protect my bike well."
59,5,great price
60,5,"Definitely worth the money if you're looking to get OBD data for you auto. Works great with ANY app on your Android device, and can read almost any code. If you are having trouble reading some data, it's not this device's fault! Does more than I expected and I'm glad I didn't go with a cheaper model."
61,5,Great product. Great seller. Fast delivery.<br />Thanks++++++
62,5,Worked great to couple two 5&#34; static hoses I had together with some pipe clamps.  Solid with a little give...was exactly the coupler I needed for my dust collector.
63,4,work just fine
64,1,Cause I didnt work there was a hole in it
65,5,Good product
66,5,Awesome product
67,5,"Fit perfectly on an 85' MR2 (AW11). It goes on much easier than the driver's side boot. I recommend putting the boot on over the inner tie rod, putting a bit of lubricant on the end of the boot, and then turning the steering wheel all the way to the right. This will compress the boot and push it onto the steering rack lip that it needs to sit on.<br /><br />The zip ties that come with the boot will not make the usual click sound as you tighten them, and there is no way to loosen them. I recommend waiting until you have the boot fully on before putting the zip tie on and tightening it."
68,4,Nice
69,5,recommended item and recommeded seller.
70,5,nice
71,1,waste product
72,5,Was easy to put on. I live up int the north so it takes a beating in the winter but has yet to peal at all.
73,3,Texture and feel wasn't the same as the one I bought before. I was also hoping for a little bit darker color of brown.
74,2,Nice quality shirt. Will only fit a gorilla in the shoulders. Torso not long and sleeves are super wide. Looks more like a muscle t and will probably end up too short.
75,5,"I have been using the Bearded Garage car sun shade for several weeks now.  It is an excellent car shade.  It does a great job of protecting the entire front windshield and it is easy to use.  And Charles and Josie, the owners, provide excellent customer service.  I had a couple of questions.  They were friendly and responsive.  I highly recommend purchasing your car shade from the Bearded Garage."
76,5,Great addition to the car
77,4,Had a few bad less but those that work are great
78,5,Did a very nice job!
79,5,It solved my AC problem!!  Works great!!
80,5,"Looks badass on my '78 Camarro. Lookout lady's , lol"
81,5,Amazing quality!
82,5,This temperature gun is the most fun thing I've in a while.  I have used this to scan darn near everything in sight...and don't get me started about what the kids scanned. The accuracy is I am guessing pretty good since it measured ice to be 31 degrees F and the dash board of my car at 133 on a sunny day.
83,5,Was exactly what we needed to fix our truck.
84,5,"This works great in my car, the sync with the torque app was simple and the speeds are good, no issues at all with this"
85,4,not use
86,5,Doesn't fit my bike but otherwise it's pretty good part
87,5,Fit perfectly and was delivered in a timely manner.
88,5,Use it all the time at work a must for any police officer !!
89,5,"I have a 1999 GMC Suburban SLT. As others have posted, the side markers do not fit this model truck, so if you need to replace those as well, buy a separate set of sidemarkers for the specific make and model. This kit is still a fantastic deal for the headlights and parking lights. Buying separate will cost 25-50 dollars more.<br /><br />I bought these to replace a set of cheapo headlights I picked up last year with a manufacturing defect: The adjustment screws and posts did nothing at all. The screws were actually just sitting in threaded holes that no function! they were a great example of copy and paste manufacturing, and why you need to do a lot of research before buying anything you are not ready to just throw away.<br /><br />The Anzo lights went in without a hitch, look great, and adjustment screws all work as expected. The headlights came with headlamps and high-beam lamps. The parking lights did not come with lamps. Great stuff, I am very pleased.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this kit for anyone with the same model year and type."
90,5,Easy to use and seems to be pretty accurate
91,5,perfect for DIY-ers
92,5,It just fits right in. NO problem whatsoever.
93,5,Headlights work great.  Exact match and fit.  Shipping was right in time
94,5,Excellent
95,5,"Good filter, Good price."
96,5,Holds at of crap
97,5,The product came fast and fit really well in my car
98,1,"Although we ordered it to fit our specific car, it didn't fit."
99,5,They ar just what I through they were the work great
100,5,This looks good and protects the tank from my husband's jacket zipper and buckles. Wish it was a little longer.
101,3,It's a good hose could be longer though
102,5,"Great tie down, would recommend"
103,5,Blends in pretty well..only notice it if your looking for it.
104,5,"Worked perfectly to clear my check engine light.  I used on 2006 silverado, and this is not an exact match to original.  The original has an inlet and outlet and this has only an inlet.  I suppose it is self-venting whereas the original connected its outlet to another vapor hose with a spark arrestor or some kind of screen at the end.  I left the old hose assembly/spark arrestor in the chassis, but couldn't connect it to this device.  Started engine up and drove around the block and check engine light cleared in 30 seconds."
105,5,"Needed this to tune up my Echo CS 3450-Type 1E after the nasty storm in late June.  Kept me from buying a new saw when I'd given up on the old one...runs like new now...yard clean up was a snap!!!  Might even take up chainsaw carving now.<br /><br />I DID NOT RECEIVE A DISCOUNT FROM ANYONE FOR THIS REVIEW; HOWEVER, ECHO IF YOU'RE OUT THERE AND YOU WANT TO GIVE ME SOME MONEY I'M DOWN WITH THAT!!!"
106,5,Easy to use! Great results! Would definitely use again. Would recommend to anyone!
107,5,my son loves this kind of stuff and uses it daily for his teachers
108,4,"works fine with water, tested drawing from a container.  Should be fine with a gear oil."
109,5,it really looks good on my laptop.
110,4,great product - fast delivery - thanks
111,5,"A little tricky to get the smaller areas to transfer to the windshield. This has withheld the test of time, with no cracking, peeling, or lifting at all."
112,4,"Raybestos 761PG Parking Brake Shoes used on 2005 Chrysler Town & Country (Limitied, LWB) with rear disk brakes.  Proper fit and function so far!"
113,5,"I hate the way that long antennas look, son I got this and took the chance that the short hight wouldn't be a problem. At the end of the day it works better then expected and it hasn't stopped a single station with no static! It's great!"
114,5,Paint matches as per paint code on my 2015 Honda CRV.
115,5,"Fit perfectly! Stopping is great, feel awesome!"
116,5,Great!
117,5,Good product.
118,5,Love this. Looks good.  Would like to order the aunoc chrome<br />for the front of my car
119,5,"awesome, even a novice can use it"
120,4,"Made in USA. Seems to be doing ok, but I haven't noticed any better gas mileage. That's why it gets a 4 star.<br /><br />I also ordered the K&N oil filter, but I returned it.<br />Quality as not same as the air filter. I used the K&N Oil filter made oversea with no wire reinforcement. After I removed it was sucked in on itself. No wire reinforcement like air filter.<br /><br />A picture of the old filter is below."
121,5,good
122,5,Worked great. My headlights had really yellowed.
123,5,Good deal
124,4,"it doesn't cover my entire windshield, there seems to be about an inch of play on either side but it is a quality product."
125,5,Good light assy. Mine came damaged from shipping. I contacted AUTOANDART and they promptly sent me a replacement. Another happy camper!
126,5,looks like it worked good
127,5,"Arrived timely, appears as advertised, functions as intended"
128,5,that's a good one for the price and it's really keep everyone on their toes and very noisy
129,1,It's cheap crap it only lasted a year .  save your money spec d is junk it's shedding from the muffler
130,1,The smallest of the two did not work on my motorcycle filter. It kept slipping.
131,5,As advertised.
132,5,It was a excellent fit to Altima 2015 ...
133,5,"I had my mechanic install this on a 97 Nissan Hardbody 2.4L 2WD.<br />The previous set was LUK, installed by a friend.<br />LUK, Valeo, Sachs, they're all junk.<br />Exedy is the best for Japanese vehicles and it has that OEM feel, you know, light and precise.<br />I would flush out your hydraulic fluid and use dot 4 valvoline synthetic.<br />If you have the funds, I would replace the master and slave cylinder.<br />Worn slave cylinder can bust and leave you stranded and worn master cylinder is squeaky"
134,4,"I bought two of these products to cover up a few stains on the front seats of my 2005 Ford Focus. They fit well on the seat itself but were a little looser on the headrest. The quality was good/average--what one could expect from the price. The design of the seat cover gives my car a sporty edge, which I like. The product was easy to install after watching the installment video provided by Bell Automotive on this listing. Overall, I am very happy with them! I would recommend this product for someone looking to easily conceal unwanted stains or add some nice flair to their vehicle."
135,5,Fit perfect and works well for my use.<br />Thanks
136,5,This product arrived on time.  I bought it to pump gas and it does the job. So it works as advertised.
137,5,Great!
138,4,"I have to say the black plastidip is great. It gives my car a matte black aggressive look. I then tried out the gloss an i didnt like it.. thank god i could remove it and start all over if i wanted to. IMO I would buy over again without the glossifier this time, but id recommend the glossifier &#34;With Pearls&#34; if you want it a better &#34;shiny&#34; look."
139,5,Great product.
140,3,There pretty bright but make double sure you seal them with silicon before installing one of mine got water in it. you get what you pay for still a good price.
141,5,"This will increase take your car to the next level, I mean it gave me at least 140+ hp on my mazda 6. Why would anyone need a turbo after buying this awesome thing?!"
142,4,Great product just need more instructions  for  use and troubleshooting. Also need longer  hose for easier adapting to low pressure side of ac system .
143,5,work-excellant
144,5,I love it! It's just like in the picture fits perfectly. Thank you so much!
145,5,Can't believe Jeep didn't already come with this stock as with pretty much every other vehicle on the market. A must if you are planning on doing any kind of distance driving with your Jeep.
146,4,"It is easy to install and the price is unbeatable. However, the bulb quality looks little cheap. But as long as the bulbs work, no complaint."
147,5,"My Check Engine light came on the day after I received notice that I needed to get my car emissions inspected.  I checked the code and it was a problem with my Mass Air Flow sensor.  My car has 110k miles on it.  I checked the price---  crazy expensive  A BMW Z4 MAF sensor is more than $400 new, with me doing the install.<br /><br />I figured I'd give this a try.  Worked like a charm.  I passed inspection and the Check engine light has remained off for the past month.<br /><br />Great Product.<br /><br />I will follow their advice.... clean it with every oil change."
148,5,Great stuff. No comparison !
149,5,Great gloves
150,5,Fast shipping and very easy to install. Looks great.
151,4,Seems well made but I agree with previous review regarding Dodge and not being able to use the wrench properly because the fender of my 2005 Ram pickup would not allow the wrench to turn once grasping the 3 tongs of antenna. Rather then cutting or modifying the wrench I found I could use the other 1-2 prong on the end of the wrench and have it grip  enough to tightnen firmly.
152,5,"Fits great, keeps the sun out.  Only wish the bag was a better fit, a little to big."
153,5,"At every oil change check Mag plug for debris since running Mobil one Twin, there is none there even when I went over mileage limit this oil seems too protect better than what factory recommends."
154,4,"Received these today, and they're pretty much what I expected.  They do not snap in.  Instead, there is double-sided tape on the lip that you peal and stick to the front of your grill.  No tools, no disassembly, no mess.  A couple of points to keep in mind:<br /><br />1. They're shaped to match the opening, so install with short lip up<br />2. They're not compatible with the MOPAR hood lock, so if you've got one of those, you'll need to make modifications as I did<br />3. They do stiffen up the plastic grill somewhat, which may be good..?<br /><br />Mods:  As stated above, I have a MOPAR hood lock installed on my jeep, so I needed to cut out part of the insert to allow access to lift the rubber cover of the lock and get the key in. This was fairly simply done with a dremel.  See pictures, if you're not sure what I'm talking about here.  While cutting out an access to the lock, I noticed that the plastic is fairly brittle and scratches easily.<br /><br />I'm attaching a couple of pictures of how these look.  Not sure I love the look 100% at this point, but the main point for me is to protect the radiator, and I'm sure they'll grow on me.<br /><br />Concerns: Brittle plastic.  Would not be surprised if these discolored fairly quickly.  Since they're surface mount, they will trap dirt between the grill and the insert.  The double-sided tape is not all the way out to the edge, creating a void behind the lip that will trap dirt."
155,1,Very simple no sting very chip I did the order by mistake sory idont recommend this
156,1,"Was highly disappointed with the shortcomings of this item. I had been awaiting it anxiously to put in my new Prius (2011).<br /><br />The thing vibrates with every inch the car moves, so you actually lose visibility just clipping this on.<br /><br />No night view. I hadn't really considered this when I purchased it, but I flip up the night view switch on my Prius (and past vehicles) - not a feature I can give up easily. I tried and might have let it go had this been exceptional in any way, but with so many problems, there was no reason not to return this.<br /><br />I only tried it on my Prius for about 10 days, so I don't know about other vehicles, but all I got out of this was a wide view of the backseat and the side of my face. It gave me no usable view outside the car. Blind spots were in no way affected by this mirror.<br /><br />Only pro I can really give this - it snaps on to the mirror nice and tight.<br /><br />Not worth anywhere near $40+."
157,5,"This stuff is awesome. I bought two rolls to do the wood trim in my Audi A4. I had quite a bit left over, but it was worth it for the price. Also, a hair dryer helps to avoid any wrinkles when applying over compound curbs."
158,5,Perfect for my husband's man cave.
159,5,Made my 16 year old Toyota Corolla (1998) like a brand new in terms of Air Conditioning in summer time. Couldn't have been more happier. Awesome product with ease of use. Loved it.
160,3,Worked but it's louder that the OE one
161,5,easy to hookup and works great
162,5,They fit my 1999 Nissan Altima like a glove. Purchasing these online saved me over $50.
163,5,works and fits great.  all the hardware and screws comes with the kit.  the instruction is clear and easy to follow.<br /><br />The only word of caution.  be careful when tightening the bolt that hold the handguard to the bracket.  The  big metal nut and bolt tighten against the plastic tabs. the tightening seems to squeezed and turns the plastic tabs white as the tightening stressed the plastic tab out.
164,5,I really love this item.
165,1,"Worked once perfectly but a few months later when I used it for the second time, the compressor didn't work at all."
166,5,"These are split so you don't have to thread them over the bar ends. They come with the silicone grease they need.<br />Always measure your bar, every on-line source told me my front sway bar was 32mm, it was 30mm.<br />No more squeaks and the front end it quite taunt feeling now (also did the links). Local price was was about<br />$75.00, then tax, so call it $80. I saved $45 from the local auto parts sources. I try to buy local when I can, but $45?<br />Really? Had my attention."
167,5,It's a great product
168,5,Excellent rotors
169,3,"Sizing is pretty much exactly as outlined in the product description and it's pretty comfortable. Just don't look at yourself in a mirror or let anyone take a picture of you while wearing this; it's ridiculously goofy looking. If you don't care about style, this is a pretty decent helmet for a solid price."
170,5,Exactly as described. Even included programming instructions that worked (in about 5 minutes)
171,5,It works! It works!  By golly it works!
172,5,nice keychain
173,5,Gaskets are of good quality materials. Should hold up well if I need one.
174,5,Nice replacement rear shocks for 2004 Dodge Ram 1500.  A little different ride from the stock ones but smooth and not rigid.  Great price and will order matching front ones later.
175,3,"The stuff works, no doubt about it. Had 42° vent temps going down the road in our '86 Grand Marquis in the original R12 system.<br /><br />Before this, I was using Freeze 12 (a blend of 134a, & 142b for oil miscibility),  which got me by for 5 years until I needed to re-up - I found that the manufacturer had ceased production, driving costs way up (although not half as bad as R12 is). Decided to sell what I had left at a massive profit, and buy this stuff for cheap & use it in the Merc. I also tried BBQ propane, but in a orifice tube system such as this, the head pressures got MUCH too high before it started cooling. Propane works better in TXV systems in aftermarket A/C or vintage cars/trucks. I had low 30° vent temps on a 93° day, on a car from the 70's with such a system. :) Propane (R290) mixed with butane (R600) keeps the head pressures down. Based on my experience,  I suspect that both of these elements are in Envirosafe - with possibly even a third.<br /><br />Once the Envirosafe arrived, I threw it in a couple buddy's cars as well as mine. Not long after, the stuff leaked out of all 3 vehicles, all within a month, which brings me to my next point ...<br /><br />Biggest issue with this stuff is, if you have any leaks in the system, this product, without question, leaks out at a much faster rate than other refrigerants. The molecular size of this product must be even smaller than 134a.<br /><br />After 8 years of playing around with alternatives, I've decided to go back to the tried and true R12 in the Grand Marquis after overhauling the entire system. Money well spent. It will now work reliably and as the manufacturer intended.<br /><br />But, if you need a quick fix, this stuff here can't be beat - just buy a couple cases of it so you can keep topping it off over the course of the summer."
176,5,Fits my 2007 Corvette perfectly and keeps the interior noticeably cooler when it must be left out in the sun
177,4,seems to work well
178,4,Works like it should easy to put on
179,1,"Description is incorrect. This is not the correct rubber grommet between the reservoir and pump. Even though it says it fits a 1986 BMW 535i, it does not. Maybe it fit the level sensor, but not the pump like it says."
180,5,better than snapon
181,1,was not the right size for my truck like it said in the description. ended up lighting my truck on fire. would not recommend just go to parts store and get the right fit the first time.
182,1,Did not work at all
183,5,factory part great price with fast shipping
184,5,great only place I could find it at this price
185,5,I am very impressed with the buff and bling. My vehicle is 10 years old yet it looks brand new. It went on easy and left no ring spots on the truck
186,5,"Wow.... I will never buy or recommend another toolbox drawer liner again... this one wins hands down every one I've ever tried!  And actually comes in usable lengths for large standing toolboxes (not the small rolls you usually can get, that are good for maybe 2-3 drawers at most).  I ended up buying 2 of the 30-foot rolls... after using this for my 2nd toolbox, I loved it so much, I ripped out the cheap crap I had in my old toolbox and replaced it with this!"
187,5,I love these mini boards! They are very well made and feel great under my feet. Expect to buy an additional adapter also. Kuryakyn 8818 Splined adapter is what my bike required. (03 Yamaha Vstar Custom)
188,4,Thnk God I finally got my trunk fixed thank u and thy wrk great
189,5,Perfect fit as described for a 2003 VW Golf
190,5,The organizer fits perfect and keeps everything in place for me. No complaints here
191,5,Brought life back to my 1984 Suzuki LT 50. Thanks for a good product at fair price.
192,5,Good leather care solution.
193,5,Fits perfect!!<br /><br />Hey truck buddy buy these ones!!!
194,5,"Drum brakes can be tricky, especially with rusted hardware.  This kit saved the day."
195,5,"Shipped quickly, works."
196,4,"works well, ordered more. A little finicky to get on even. Not real hard. Long lasting not too shiny, I like it"
197,5,These were cool. And made my lancer look more aggressive!
198,5,Good fit.
199,4,The 14X14 fit my 96' R1100RT seat perfectly.
200,5,"This is a grate electronics cleaner. It may take a little time for the mist to evaporate, but in the end it really fixes many different electronic buttons and switches and peramatures"
201,5,This is a great liner! Fits perfectly in my 07 GMC Yukon!
202,5,Came as described and on time.  Magnets are not 'smooth'-  the backs are textured so they don't &#34;stick&#34; to the paint and mar the finish.  Great product and good seller.
203,5,Worked as it was supposed to. No issues or complaints.
204,5,I ORDERED THIS FOR MY BUDDY FOR HIS NEW DODGE RAM 1500 IT WAS EASY TO INSTALL IN LESS THEN 30min IT FIT LIKE A GLOVE AND HE LOVES IT!!
205,3,"I like the product because it keeps the sun off my dashboard. However, it is not big enough for my 2003 Ford Focus windscreen."
206,4,Works very well at RV parks.
207,5,Works great!
208,5,It works on Southwest flights!
209,4,Installed easy look great
210,5,Can't  go wrong with an OEM filter. Fits perfect.
211,4,Good product.
212,4,"Good cloths. Not nearly as nice as premium microfiber, but they get the job done. Price has gone up over the past year. A pack of 24 was 12.80."
213,1,"Horrible garbage, don't waste your money. Just spend a couple extra bucks and get something decent. Seriously one snapped within two days of installing on my JK, and I barely put any weight on it. I will never buy anything like this again."
214,1,Terrible. One ballast would not even work and it sounded like it was broken internally. The other barely works and flickers when turned on.
215,5,Great battery and price for 01 BMW 740. A battery from the BMW dealer sucks.
216,5,The merchandise was  A-1 and come in according to your shipping information. You dd me a great favor in my search for the part I needed and the price was reasonable. Thank You for being there when I needed you!  LeRoy  R. Palmer
217,3,"took the rotors off my 1999 Grand Caravan, and the bolt pattern of these rotors was too small.  I scoured the information and cannot find anywhere, any information on sizing.  the only thing I had to go by was that  they were stated to match my vehicle.  the rotors look good, the machining looked good, the pads looked good.....  so the 3 stars on perceived quality.  once I get the correct size, I will comment how the installation went."
218,4,they look good
219,5,Nice solid quality mirror
220,5,Really inexpensive and perfect for a medium sized car.
221,4,so far so good we see when the rain comes
222,2,Fan motor showed up (Sold by Amazon via Amazon Prime) not as pictured.  The harness is remote instead of being mounted to the body/case.  The harness/connector was attached by wires that had been smashed against the seem of the case hard enough to cut the wires and damage the copper.  The wires were also painted and very sloppy.  In addition the connector is rubber and the below OEM quality.
223,5,A+
224,3,"is ok, works well"
225,5,This fits perfectly on the steering wheel.  I love the vibrant color and the memory foam gives a very comfortable grip. This cover is perfect in winter to keep your hands from freezing while holding onto it and awesome in summer to keep you from burning your hands.
226,5,"Excellent , it's just what I expected"
227,4,"Good price for the unit.  Very touchy on the brake adjustment though, locks up the electric brakes on 3 or more bars on the unit.  Mount it so you can easily change the adjustment strength while you are driving."
228,5,Excellent product
229,5,WORKS AWESOME!!! I pull my 3/4 ton Dodge crew cab into the garage and set it up so the rear bumper is just inside the door so we can walk in front of the truck with no problem. Definitely better than the battery operated versions.
230,5,Great fit and finish.
231,5,These lug nuts fit perfect and the driver was a very handy accessory.  Make my wheels on my 1998 Ranger look fantastic. Highly recommend them to everyone !!!
232,5,Work great.
233,5,"If you have aftermarket pipes + high air flow intake installed on your bike then you absolutely need a fuel management system.  My bike sputtered, popped, and farted constantly before I installed the Fuelpak.  After installing it, my 2009 H-D Sportster / Iron 883N really came to life.  The power band felt vastly improved, and it just sounded that much better across the RPM spectrum.  A great investment since it also improved the distance I get from a full tank - much better MPG usage now too!  I am getting better than 40mpg now, closer to ~45mpg whereas before the Fuelpak I was lucky to go 80 miles before the fuel gauge light was on."
234,5,It hasn't fallen off lol
235,2,"I wish I could give this product 5 stars but I am buying a different one as we speak.  Why?  Well, the other day I had to take the cover off and I saw underneath that it was moist on the button where it meets the back side.  So I did a small test.  I let the water run on one side to see if the water would reach the other side.  It did.  Somehow when I touched the other side my hands were clearly wet with water.  It was not dripping but somehow the moist was reaching the other side.  I sweat profusely.  I am in New Orleans and I accumulate a decent amount of sweat; having said that the summer is not in full blast so I have not sweated but a fifth of what I am expecting in the coming months.  Hope this helps in your buy.  Oh, one more thing.  I have cloth seats.  This item moves to the side leaning towards the passenger side after a number of days."
236,5,I bought this kit for my 2000 golf tdi. Good price and the water pump in this kit has the metal impeller which is superior to the plastic one. No issues with the kit.
237,4,Fit was good
238,1,It finished very quick this time even l did not use too much
239,5,"I got these to replace my OEm bolt-ons that were all scuffed up and cracked from over a decades worth of driving. Packaging could've been more tight. I was surprised they weren't cracked when I got em, but I guess the ABS plastic is that strong. They look nice on my car. I watched a buncha youtube vids before installing them to make sure I got the ring on correct, put them on without crackin them, and make sure they dont fall off while drivin. They seem pretty tight on the steel wheel, so i doubt theyll be fallin off anytime soon. It has a nice gloss to it. Not too shiny, not too flat. Looks really nice. Only thing is that I wish these were bolt ons. That way, I know they wont fall off, and also when i get my tires rotated, I wont risk breaking a clip on accident taking them off....I thought about drillin-out the fake lug nuts to &#34;make&#34; bolt ons, but the caps weren't designed that way. TIPS: 1) put a little electrical tape on the retention ring for a tighter fit. 2) dont use tools. I used both my hands and a foot. 3) watch some youtube vids"
240,5,"good product ,it worked as I expected If you are looking for a breaker switch this is a good buy ."
241,1,If you install this on a 2013 Tacoma you will need a special antenna removal tool in order to remove the old antenna stud. The antenna did not come with the special tool. I ended up having my local dealer put the antenna on as a favor.
242,5,A+
243,5,"I'm a Ford technician, I have been using this for a couple years, love it. I already had this one, but prices keep going up so I bought this one as a backup."
244,5,"If you like shiny hubcaps, this is your go-to. I've had these on for months and they still look as shiny as when I first bought them. The clips are sturdy and I've had no problems at all taking off and re-applying these constantly."
245,5,Double thumb up!
246,5,"Great product, eliminates glare on windshield at night from gauges, easy to install looks Great."
247,5,Everything great thanks much !!!
248,5,"Works as advertised. Strong open, be careful."
249,4,This item is made of plastic but works well.
250,5,Wish it was made out of aluminum so it wouldn't rust.
251,5,Awesome...thanks!
252,4,this is a great product
253,5,looks fantastic
254,1,"These batteries are crap to me! I purchased these because of the 2800 mAh, I have the 2500 mAh, and it's a huge difference between the two.<br />With my 2500 I can vape all day long for almost two days. The 2800 didn't last all day at all......bad purchase on my part!"
255,5,A little noisy and feels sorta cheap BUT it works just FINE. The digital display and auto-set inflation  and auto-shutoff is very handy.
256,4,The shade arrived on time but is a bit small for my Ford Edge.  Next time I'll have to look harder for dimensions.
257,1,Complete trash. One of the ballast and bulb didn't work.. I would appreciate a refund
258,5,Repaired the blower connector perfectly on my 2002 GMC Envoy. The original speed 5 wire and the connector burned causing speed 5 not to work.
259,5,"dealer wanted $1075.00 to replace this part. took about 35 min. to do it myself,works great in 2005 Cadillac SRX."
260,5,"Nice ramp, very strong."
261,4,it works great but just not far off like the orignal one.
262,5,Super easy to intall.
263,5,Love it
264,5,"This is an excellent factory replacement switch.  My door switch failed after 21 years of use.  This new one took about a minute to replace, fits perfectly, and works perfectly."
265,5,"It was a great price , and I got it faster then I expected"
266,3,"Chrome plates,did not come with nuts tho so o had to run to the hardware store to buy some. Should've bought another ralliart badge if I knew this product would've been complete and didn't had false advertising."
267,4,"Much stiffer than the blown Gabriels we pulled off. Only gave 4 stars bc though these def did the job, still feel it could be a little stiffer. Perhaps Bilsteins next time. The ass end of this car must be heavy heavy for these vehicles to burn through shocks like they do. They good for now."
268,5,Perfect
269,4,"Fit right, work good, we will see how long they last."
270,4,"I'm fairly happy with this unit, My main gripe is that instant MPG is too instant seem they should average out 10 readings or so to smooth it out, instant MPG jumps all over the place with every bump in the road of gust of wind"
271,5,Used to prime my plastic 2004 Toyota Tacoma wheel hubs before I repainted them.<br />Used the PlastiKote metallic grey paint and PlastiKote Clear lacquer to cover the completed job.<br />Sticks to the plastic like iron.  Car washes have no power over this paint!
272,3,vibrating when playing music<br />  Yes they are tight
273,5,"I love this lock it is sturdy, solid, well made and I feel very confident it will stop anyone from stealing my trailer."
274,5,I purchased these for my in-laws who were in need of remotes and were astounded at the price of these elsewhere. These have worked great for them with absolutely no issues. Highly recommend.
275,5,great :)
276,5,Very nice car cover good quality..
277,5,Great Product  Thanks
278,5,Thank you  they fit well and are affordable.
279,4,"Packaging was a little weak but it arrived ok. Light duty but it serves the purpose, good value just not real heavy construction."
280,5,As described plug and play
281,5,Exactly what I wanted at a reasonable price.
282,5,Looks great
283,5,Purchase was packaged securely - and delivered promptly - Perfect. - Thank you
284,5,Fit is great. At first it was hard to get on and off but after wearing it on a few rides it's broken in. I love how it covers ears and cuts down on road noise. This graffic is like nothing I have seen before and love having a unique helmet. Everyone complements me on it.
285,3,Not super easy to install but doable.
286,4,bought this for our new used RV which I managed to back into a small tree on our first trip. This stuff did the trick on helping to fix the damage to upper corner of the roof. I just used my hands to mash it into place. I used sheet metal pieces to cover holes (taking off antennas and such) the covered the sheet metal with this stuff. Very sticky. the only complaint is the cutting it straigt and removal of the protective membrane. With two people it would be easier but I'm usually alone on these projects.
287,5,Made my 1996 honda accord come to life.
288,5,Good fit easy mounting and works well
289,4,Dimmer then I had hoped. They are a fraction of the brightness of the factory bulbs but it still lights up the cab of my 2012 GMC Sierra. I'm not sure if I could read a map very well with only the two lights on. Overall I'd say I like them and will keep them awhile.
290,5,This was an awesome deal.  The heavy-duty floor mats were perfect for my son's car and alone were worth the price I paid for the entire set. The car seat covers are comfortable and look nice.
291,5,"Easy install, perfect fit. great value."
292,5,great!
293,3,Custom fit? I think not. One of  the reasons I bought these was because they were advertised as having a grommet to keep the mats from moving just like the originals. The drivers side did but not the passenger side. The fit for both was a just little off but not too bad. The quality was nice but not sure they were truly worth the price.
294,5,Nice steps.  Easy diy install on 2015 Pro4X.
295,5,"On the plus side, you can't beat this deal.  The big 3 auto parts stores had replacement FOBs but wanted $50 - $100 EACH..  Two for $10 by comparison, is a GREAT deal.  After getting them programmed, the range seems comparable to any other FOB I've ever had.<br /><br />On the down side, the instructions are not accurate for my vehicle.  I have a 2007 Expedition EL.  So I, naturally, followed the Expedition instructions.  This didn't work for me after about 4 tries.  The car wouldn't go into program mode.  Before I got bent out of shape, I decided to try the other instructions.  I have a factory DVD player that identifies itself as a Lincoln Navigator.  So I figured, maybe the EL uses other Gator parts.  Sure enough, following the Navigator instructions (specifically leaving the driver door open) worked the first time.  And the rest of the programming worked as well."
296,5,Good value for the money
297,5,One third the price of the local auto parts stores and solved my stalling problems on my 2003 Ford F150.
298,5,A bit of a wait but worth it. Well packaged and fairly easy to install.
299,5,On my 05 TRX I didn't have any problems with mounting and it sounded good.
300,5,"Cheaper on amazon than any auto store. Easy installation, just attach to original connector. Wires could be longer for more universal applications. Highly recommend!"
301,5,Very satisfied with this product
302,4,Order 1 size up from what u wear for a 110$ jacket u def can't  beat it only thing i wish it had was some hard armour in the spine then it would  be perfect  there is nothing protecting your spine this is the only reason i cant give it 5 stars
303,4,Would gave better rating but stickers aren't pre cut to shape and each of them needs to be cut separately to size.  They should be pre cut for use before shipping.
304,4,"The wire is not as thick as it looks. Most of the connectors are cheap quality. No fuses are provided, so they need to be soldered in. I cut out the plastic clip for the power wires and put the fuses there.  Update 6/7/15: these is really horrible quality. It took me a while to get around to installing it, but when I finally did, my brights didn't work at all. After investigation, the high beam wire inside the headlight plug had literally been crimped over top of the shielding on the wire. That's ridiculous. Because of this, I have decided to build my own with wire that can actually hold 100+ watts and not fry. It cost me $20 more, but the piece of mind knowing my headlights won't cut out is the best part."
305,5,good
306,5,Super comfy.
307,5,Good quality hose
308,5,It was delivered timely and worked great
309,5,"Bought this for my husband, and he loves it thus far.  I wanted something that protected his whole head, including his jaw.  Overall, no scratches or anything like that on the helmet.  He's already switched to the shaded shield, and loves it.  Overall, a good buy."
310,5,Thank
311,5,this unit replaced another brand that burned up when the battery failed. Usual Deltran quality...first rate.
312,5,They arrived on time and did exactly what they were supposed to do.  It was quite easy to program them and the directions were simple and clear.
313,5,Good product. Installed of my 15 Silverado in about 30 minutes on the hoist.
314,5,easy to install  awesome reverse light very bright . not annoying like some of those other light that are not led
315,4,Item arrived on time and was as described. Good effect for the money
316,5,Work great...i really recommend this to everybody
317,5,"The above product was correct and spot on as advertised. I received the product on time,fit perfect and color was dead on.Was easy to install and works great.I would buy this product again."
318,1,Shipping was fast but once I received them I plugged them in to verify if they worked. One worked fine but the other has only 3 leds working. Contacted support and still havnt heard back. Good thing it was only 30 bucks. Guess if you want cheap prices you get cheap quality.
319,5,Keeps my carpets protected.
320,5,Love it!!! Fits perfectly!!!! Instructions need to be updated w/ exact literature!! Plus all tools needed!!! Luckily I have everything!!!
321,3,item was shipped quick. however its packaging was open. but it worked.
322,5,absolute life saver.
323,5,Good quality.
324,5,Excellent
325,5,saved money worked great!
326,4,I like them the color matched what was in there
327,5,Just what I expected thanks
328,2,Very disappointed with this product.  Tried it on several different hoses and several different outside faucets.  Leaks and the pressure from it is worse than the cheap sprayers from Big Lots.
329,5,my nephews love their gift
330,5,FAST AND WAY MORE THAT WHAT I WAS GETTING!!
331,5,"Fast shipping, and fit perfectly."
332,5,looks good and fits just fine
333,5,As described and fast shipping.
334,5,Just got mine today it's a good fit I like it better then my first one that was twice the price.  I'm 6' and 160 pounds and it fits perfect I bought the medium. If you don't have a gut buy your jacket size.
335,4,Factory replacement for 99 S10 ZR2.  Installed great with No issues.
336,5,Nice to have these on the roof so we can have the vents open when traveling or when it is raining.  Did not have any leakage when the rain was coming down and the vent was open.
337,5,Perfect fit for my 09 Tacoma
338,5,Great deal on an otherwise exorbitantly priced $20 dollar collection of plastic and 3 radio shack transistors....(Usually $350 retail)
339,5,"Wow.  I can't begin to tell you how bright these suckers are.  I know LED are brighter, use less energy and last a whole lot longer than your average RV lamp.  These replace most of the 1141 that are in my coach.  I have to replace a few complete assemblies but I order some of those too.  Thanks Gold Stars."
340,5,Worked fantastic on my 2006 Renegade 600 HO
341,5,outstanding
342,5,I can finally sit upright.  I hit 93 mph today & it held on.  Looks great & no vibration.
343,5,thanks
344,5,Very bright light bar and it is perfect for my jeep.
345,5,It is very good
346,4,Used on my horse trailer. Works great. Just what I needed.
347,1,Cheap chinese piece of junk. I guess in a lot of ways I should have known better than to buy the cheapest set of led headlights I could find. First off the damn things are wired backwards so you have to remove wiring from the back of the connector just to get the high/low beam working properly. Then the damn things only worked for about a month before the low beams went out. So i messaged the company &#34;astrology depo&#34; and after proving to them that the low beams were inop they finally sent me a new headlight. Only one even though I specifically told them in the email that my low beams (plural) were inop and they only send one. Wtf people use some common sense! Save your time and money. Spend a little more money and get a better product.
348,3,Not vary bright
349,5,Great product and perfect fit.  Very durable and looks good in my new 2014 King Ranch F150.
350,5,Our grandson loved it he said it was really cool.
351,2,Doesn't fit worth a crap up against the front seats.  Can not get it snugged up enough to be tight.  Seems like there is about 4 inches to much fabric.  It needs a bar or something across it to make it tight.  Not one of the manufacturers better products by far.  I have an idea that will make it better but I shouldn't have to go to those lengths when the maker should step up there game and get it right the first time.
352,5,"These are great.  They are small, but bright enough. They are wired with 3 wires, so they could be running lights as well as turn signals. Service was great"
353,1,It's still on my wife's truck and discolored in less than 3 months to a butt ugly orange.
354,5,Very cute.
355,4,"Placard fits with 1/4&#34; cutting adjustment, clip for mirror struggles to fit larger mirror post. Works for me, arrived on time,<br />clear plastic seems sturdy, time will tell if it holds up to UV/sun."
356,5,Love it!! Easy to use and makes the leather look new.
357,5,wow what a horn! had a friend wire it up it needed a diode but to someone who knows what they're doing it's not hard. this thing is loud love it
358,3,It worked well.but I think we need to clean the radiator. thank you.
359,4,Works well.
360,5,GOOD PRODUCT
361,4,"They're all right.  Only lasted about 11 months on my Dodge Grand Caravan before they started grinding onto the 'nub', which is about par for brake pads on that mini-van."
362,5,"two tools in one , ! great thanks"
363,5,Great product installed in less than 5 min.
364,5,"These fit perfect in my 2005 Z71 Suburban, and the color matched my carpet perfect as well, extremely happy!"
365,4,"We are storing our F250 Crew cab indoors, but wanted to have a cover over to protect it, this one fits good and arrived quickly.  My husband put it on easily by himself. Ours form fits around the mirrors, although the pictured does not show it."
366,2,"It works, but the build quality is horrible"
367,2,"the smell is so stinky it does not go away from your car, smells like cheap detergent"
368,5,Great
369,5,"I was very skeptical on this product, a friend of mine lent me his old Edge trail jammer for a couple of weeks. I just used the programmer not the throttle body or the air intake. I noticed a big difference. so I purchased the Superchip Trail Jammer kit. I am extremely pleased with the product. I will recommend this to anyone. I know the price is a little steep, but well worth the $$$."
370,3,"Don't really see anything different in performance or mileage, but I only had 65k on truck, so maybe the injectors weren't too dirty. Will try one more time in a few months."
371,3,"very nice, recommended when planning to go out and using the extra key for valet parking."
372,5,oem. perfect fit
373,5,Look and function perfect.  I was a little leery about the in-channel design but these seemed to have many more positive reviews than the stick-on style so I gave them a try.  Glad I did.  They look much better and fit perfectly.
374,2,they get real hot and lots of hesitation when getting pass a hundred pound
375,5,It works perfectly so far no problems
376,1,These are illegal and a menace to anybody that is nearby.  Shame  on the manufacturer.
377,2,"To start off, just received in the mail a day ago, received in five days so fast shipping, unpacked only to find a nice set of headlights with the exception of a broken tab on the passenger headlight, so I glued it back, had to drill out holes for the pin, then went to adjust them and one of the adjusters stripped its plastic gears so I couldn't even get them adjusted right, and to top it all off, with my hids they have no spread at all, look like two dots in the road, almost unsafe to drive with, needless to say I pulled them out and put them right back on craigslist, they looked great and would work awesome for a truck you only drive during the day, don't wasted your money, they have made on china stickers on them so you get what you pay for. Beware"
378,5,Smooth
379,4,The keyless entry device (FOB) I purchased from iKeyless was perfect.  Exactly what I was looking for and it was shipped to me in a reasonable amount of time.  It works great.  Thank you.
380,5,"I want and buy it, so I'm satisfied."
381,5,best oil filters for the money in regards to how well it cleans and the nut welded on back is vital.  also love how it has a hole for safety wire if needed.
382,1,Much smaller than expected.  Really not worth the money.
383,4,"Each wipe is huge. I rip them in half before using. I can clean the bathroom mirror, medicine cabinets, faucets and sinks with just half the wipe."
384,4,"Product was exactly what I wanted, black in color, fat series. But description of fitment was wrong, did not fit my atv."
385,1,Had 1 burn out in 2 weeks
386,5,"In my opinion, works better than RainX wipers. Those did not completely wipe away rain. These do."
387,5,This has saved our cars and garage from damage. The beam is very sharp and allows to adjust to meet your needs. my wife would either pull in too far or not enought. On two separate occasions the garage door closed and scrapped the back of her car- damaging the paint job. Now she and I know exactly where to stop.
388,1,"The base won't stay attached, you can't glue it on because it covers the refill hole, and it won't stand up on it's own with the slightest movement. If you buy it, chances are... you'll be as mad as I am!"
389,5,Got this for my son's jeep that he is constantly taking apart and putting back together.  He put it on the driver's fender.  Love it!  He gets lots of compliments on it.
390,5,Had the parts installed on my 2007 Honda van and no problems with anything at all. Had it installed by a Honda tech and was told parts were the same as OE. The only that you have to get is seals and serp. belt. Saved money going this route with parts. Parts would have cost 450.00 at Honda in my area.
391,5,Great product. Looks nice on my 2015 Tacoma truck.
392,5,Very nice fit on my bike and looks great as well. Very pleased.
393,5,Great product.  Fits well easy to install
394,5,Didn't take long to get and everything was great
395,5,Fit perfectly.
396,5,I love them they make my car look good
397,5,Fantastic improvement over stock. Highly recommended. Good quality glass with good light spread
398,5,This is a great steering wheel cover.  Does not get sticky and looks great.
399,5,Delivered on time works great
400,5,Excellent blades would recommend for any vehicle
401,4,Genuine GM part and good quality.  Fits very well.
402,5,Very cheap and easy light set bright and actually pretty easy to make into surface mounted if you have the time and know what you're doing
403,5,It's an NTK for 1/2 the price
404,5,Looks great but haven't in installed yet still at work.
405,5,Good deal
406,5,"Expensive, but it's the only game in town due to the unique shape of the windshield - Excellent fit and rolls up tightly for storage."
407,5,"They are great for a legal solution to getting more light without doing a wiring loom or hid kit.<br />The forward lighting is great, it's not a tall beam so you don't have to worry about getting flashed by oncoming traffic. There is clear hotspots in the beam pattern, but nothing that is annoying. They're 100 times better than halogen.<br />The looks are a matter of preference, I love the look on my silver XJ but I know that some people prefer the more oem appearance.<br />My next upgrade is some rigid driving lights for more vertical and distance light, but the truck lites are great regardless, I just want a little more for pitch black country roads."
408,4,Great
409,3,"Fast shipping and excellent price,however it took a pretty heavy modification to fit to my 740 Volvo that it claimed to be an exact fit,overall for the price it is a nice hitch."
410,5,"Just what I needed, keeps my 64 mustang cool"
411,5,"These &#34;bulbs&#34; were installed on my Honda Accord as a replacement for my stock headlights. These LED lights serve as my low-beams and daytime running lights.<br /><br />The box contains three parts per bulb, there's a pair of headlight bulbs, so that's six pieces total. First there's the LED bulb itself. In the picture its the LED, the heatsink and goes to a screw thread that connects to the next part. The next part is the fan which serves to cool the LED. At 80w (40w per bulb) this does get hot, but is still much cooler than a regular halogen bulb. Anyways, the fan screws onto the back of the LED and heatsink. There'll be two sets of wires, one set comes from the LED bulb and the other comes off the fan. The bulb power source has a o-ring and threading to hold it tightly together, the fan connector is just a snap connector.<br /><br />Those wires connect to an inverter.. or possibly a power regulator. This is far smaller than an HID ballast, but serves a similar purpose. The wires from the bulb and fan connect to this inverter. Coming from the inverter is a long-ish (about a foot and a half) wire with two contacts. For me this wire terminated without a connector... meaning you need to provide your own connector to hook into the car (or splice the wires in). That's where it lost a star. Otherwise, they're perfect. I believe on other versions (such as 9005) there is no need to splice in a connector.<br /><br />The install was simple, while you do have two inverter boxes to figure out where to store, there's no harness to build or run like an HID kit. This kit connects directly to the stock system and works, a direct replacement. In fact, they probably use less power than a standard halogen bulb. Each bulb draws less than 12v (about 9.6v if I recall correctly).<br /><br />The LEDs produce a very cool (daylight, maybe even cooler 6k?) light from my headlights, similar to the Xenon lights.<br /><br />So far, the LEDs have been reliable and the seller has been responsive to my questions. They're also far brighter than my original halogen bulbs.<br /><br />The TLDR? IF you're thinking about them, get them. These are worth it. They're brighter, use less power, run cooler, and are easy to install.than my original halogen bulbs.  The TLDR? IF you're thinking about them, get them. These are worth it. They're brighter, use less power, run cooler, and are easy to install."
412,5,Works great fast shipping looks good
413,5,perfect fit!
414,5,Fit my engine splash shield on a 2006 Honda Civic EX perfectly. 20 in the package.
415,5,good stuff
416,5,Nice piece
417,5,Works better than everything I have ever used.
418,5,Job well done
419,5,Great Fit!!!
420,5,Exact fit
421,4,Good product as promised
422,5,works great
423,5,"I had an issue with the first set of lights they seller sent , but after contacting the seller with my issue they quickly sent me out another set and even made it right by only charging me half price for my troubles. I wired up the new lights and all I can say is amazing. I had another set of these lights from another seller that I've had since 2012 and they are still kicking. Not one LED has burnt out. I'm hoping that these will last a very long time as well. You won't go wrong with this purchase."
424,5,Very nice! Love it!
425,5,As promised
426,5,Nice shampoo!!!
427,5,perfect to keep your car clean
428,5,"AS GOOD AS YOU CAN GET , WORKS WELL, FITS MY APP."
429,5,It fit beautifully... And it wasn't very difficult to put together...
430,1,Very loose fit. Actually fell off inside the headlight housing! Very tough to get out after this happens !!!
431,5,"Haven't had the chance to use this as of yet, but bought this not only for the good price, but for it's non-chemical properties. Hope it does as well as expected.<br /><br />3/15/2015 Used this product for the first time today. Sorry guys....not worth the money spent. Sending it back for a refund. Sounded good ...especially being eco-friendly and all ??...but, if it don't work, not worth buying."
432,4,"Haven't had to us it yet, but since Amazon asked now for the review, all I can say is it seems to be fine and I like that it is small and I can easily keep it in the trunk or even under the seat of the car."
433,5,Look nica on my honda civic 92
434,5,Good
435,5,I Love It!
436,5,SHOWED UP ON TIME AND IS WHAT I WAS EXPECTING
437,5,Love it
438,5,I put this on my 2013 gmc denali hd. The instructions are lacking but I was able to watch a youtube video on how to install it. So far i like it. Very quiet operation. Also makes bleeding the air in the fuel system super easy.
439,3,Watch the build date for you 2001-diesel pickup.  I had to get the earlier build date once I removed the hose and had drained the coolant.  Also it look as if you could this hose to shorten it and fit but the end you have to cut is too small of diameter to for on the water pump outlet.
440,2,"I can barely see at night. They have a great color, but incredibly dull compared to cheap OEM bulbs."
441,1,"Nothing like the description reads. I assumed this was a roll of 5&#34; discs, but it was just a roll; a solid roll of sand paper and on top of it all they weren't even the purple 3M film, they are paper so don't even try wet sanding let alone time spent to cut them out into 5&#34; discs. don't waste your time or money on these."
442,5,product great. but package was not taped well and was open when delivered.
443,5,Excellent fit and delivered before the stated delivery period.  Very satisfied with product and Amazon.
444,5,Excellent service and product.
445,5,Nice
446,5,good valve
447,1,"We could have made these in-house for about $4.00 worth of sheet metal.  All they are is strips of sheet metal with flimsy plastic holders, that don't hold."
448,5,"Fits perfectly, just as advertising says. Must have if you experience snow/mud ."
449,5,Easy to install and perfect fit
450,5,It fits my truck yeah!
451,4,They are great work great and everything is stock you don't have to worry about anything besides the trimming!
452,5,Fits my Cub Cadet ZTR perfectly.
453,3,My bf has a civic SI 2007 and this cover is too big for shift nob.
454,2,The holder and caps are nice. The black lettering does start to fall off a couple of letters here and there and after a year they are all gone. It looks better now that they have all falling out then when they were half out.
455,5,great replacement tensioner for your 7.3 powerstroke. the belt tension is perfect and getting the belt on and off is easy with a 1/2&#34; ratchet inserted in the 1/2&#34; tensioner hole.
456,5,"Exactly what I wanted, expected and received."
457,1,I purchased two of these.  Within a week the plastic adjuster for the telescoping extension broke and on the other the chisel end broke loose from the shafts and had to reglue.  Very cheaply made .
458,5,good thing!
459,3,Not exactly what I expected but quality appears good and fits well
460,4,Good high quality sealed switch. Nice tactile detent feel between positions.
461,5,These lights are bright and last! Customer service works with you 100% if needed. Have bought several sets and love them all. Have had them in both stock housing and halo housing and are beast.
462,5,As good or better than OEM!!!
463,5,Just what I need it
464,4,"Worked great, it did take a couple of times to get both the new and old remote programmed the same.  That was just due to the process not the new remote."
465,5,"Very good until now, I like it. It is affordable also."
466,5,"For as long as I can remember, the two lowest fan settings in my mom's car didn't work. After doing some research and watching a few videos, I was confident that replacing the old resister would do the trick, and it did. The old one is completely fried.<br /><br />I suppose people would consider this an easy job to do, but it did take me quite a while longer than I had expected, even though I knew exactly what to do. The location of the resister is less than convenient, and the bolts that hold it in place are so small (1/8&#34;?) that I didn't have a socket small enough to remove them, so I had to fumble around with a pair of pliers instead, which was really awkward while laying upside down in the passenger seat.<br />But of course the location is no fault of the product itself. With something like this, all that matters is whether it works or not. It works, so it's an easy 5 stars from me.<br /><br />It might be worth noting that the resistor I received looks different from the one shown in the product listing. The one I received is black on one side and white on the other. Not sure if it's actually ACDelco but I really don't care since it does what it's supposed to do and I never want to see it again."
467,3,Good product
468,5,Like the other reviews it took a little time to figure out that putting the &#34;covers&#34; over the existing key was not going to work.  It is a bit unnerving to unsnap the existing cover just in case you might need to put them back.  A good set of graphic instructions would have helped immensely.  A small price to avoid confusion.
469,5,"Quality decal,"
470,1,"Both wipers started streaking after 1-month and the metal frames rusted after two-months.  Do not buy Rain-X brand wipers, you're better off buying a cheaper store brand wiper than this trash."
471,5,Fits perfectly !!
472,5,"Work fine, bit flimsy, but they do what they need to do. Can't beat the price!"
473,3,"I have a wimpy dual horn set up on my 2012 GMC Sierra from the factory, one of my horns went out so I decided to &#34;upgrade&#34; to a louder horn. getting to the old horn was the biggest issue, I had to take the whole front end off the truck almost, but that has nothing to do with the horn  this horn mounted pretty easy in the stock location and I bought the aftermarket universal wiring harness available here which made hooking it up a breeze, its definitely louder than the stock horn but not as loud as I anticipated, totally different tone as well, not bad just different, on a motorcycle I assume it seems much louder due to you being so much closer to it and it being out in the open. Also this horn is not instant on, there is a SLIGHT delay, when I hit my remote door locks my horn will beep, this horn tries to cycle and spits out a little bit of air but makes no sound. My remaining stock horn still beeps."
474,4,works fine.  just be aware of weight.  it is heavy.
475,5,mmm... beefy (endlinks)
476,5,"Works on 3500 2014 Ram 4X4.  The famous unknown and unseen Lubrication point on these vehicles requires this tool.  The lube point is not a Zerk fitting and it is not in the U-joint itself.  It is just behind the rear U-joint on the front driveshaft.  The lube point is a tiny silver inward dimple or depression in the yoke that holds this u-joint-the rearward part.  If you follow it you can see behind it the rubber boot where your grease ends up if properly injected in.  It is difficult to find due to the new bracing for the stiffer improved frame system.  There is a big cross brace going under the yoke and U-joint as it feeds into the transfer case but it is still accessible from just in front of it.  Slightly jack the truck enough to allow the drives front wheel to spin-Jack stand the frame for safety.  Get under there and slowly spin the front drive shaft until you find the grease &#34;dimple&#34; (it is small -half the size of a pencil erasure) and the are needs to be clean to see it.  Once you find have this tool firmly threaded on to your grease gun flexible line -if alone you really need a pneumatic one (great one at northern tool). Spin the shat to where the grease dimple or port is at 3 o'clock (facing the passenger door.  Awkwardly take the tool and bend the hose and line it up straight in it (there is even some curvature to the yoke carved out as a path).  when you push the plastic tipped metal needle into the port it will only go about 1/16 of an inch and you will feel a slight click as it opens-That is all it is going to open.  then pull the trigger and shoot the grease in.  If you are straight in on the tip applying moderate pressure all the grease will go in and I can see the boot behind swell with each pump.  If you get off angle or don't have the port clicked open with the pressure the grease will not go in and will just make a mess at the port.  A grease needle any longer would not work.  If I had to pump, hold the hose and needle while getting it aimed straight in I could not do it--BUT with the air powered grease gun I was able to do it successfully.  By the way I have a pretty good dealership and I am using my free oil changes and I can tell they are not greasing this fitting so I am glad this tool works so well.imed straight in I could not do it--BUT with the air powered grease gun I was able to do it successfully.  By the way I have a pretty good dealership and I am using my free oil changes and I can tell they are not greasing this fitting so I am glad this tool works so well."
477,4,"Arrived in good time, product same as OEM. I bought as a spare, just in case item."
478,5,Good
479,4,They work and fit well.  When its below 50 degrees outdide your hands will definitely get cold on anything more than a 30 minute ride.
480,5,As expected. looks great.
481,4,"it was a good color match,but didn't flow out like I was hoping for."
482,5,Love it!
483,5,Go Steelers!
484,5,Great
485,4,Very good product. Works great. I especially like two sided lights. That allows me to be sure they are working. Rated it a 4 because it is wired awkwardly - the left should be the right.
486,5,"Perfect fit form my 2000 Mazda MPV, dealer and other replacement part shops wanted an arm and a leg.  The only thing is that you must use the wiring harness included, not interchangeable with OEM harness."
487,1,"Good price. Fast shipping.  Update after one year. These are a good price, but you get what you pay for. I am going to have to replace again. These went bad in less than a year. I will go with a better brand (timken or moog)."
488,5,every car should have one of these in it.
489,5,i love it
490,5,Neat and bright and a nice slider switch on the side.
491,5,awesome transmission cooler for my dodge cummins with a 47re transmission
492,5,perfect fit AAAAA
493,2,Would have been ok - if the sent me a right and a left
494,5,Seems to have improved mileage and performance.  Noise level is not a problem unless one continually makes jack-rabbit starts.
495,5,Great
496,1,"One of these lights worked great. The other one, however, had the projector broken off upon arrival. I super glued it back on, but when I plugged it in I realized that the led's on the side did not even work. The one that did work was VERY bright. Too bad I didn't have a working pair."
497,3,It's very small.  Had to enlarge the hole so it would go on my antenna.  Cannot see it across the parking lot but is visible if I'm in the wrong row and checking right and left.
498,5,Really neat!
499,5,"This was a Christmas gift for my cousin, who always has a blanket in her car because she's always cold, especially while warming up the car.  She has since told me that she absolutely loves the blanket.  It was the perfect gift for her and she has been using it continually throughout this winter."
500,5,fresh fresh fresh!
501,1,It worked great for the first two weeks than started giving high voltage error codes and would not pass electricity to my trailer. My new voltmeter showed 122V but the PT30 showed 156V.  At the next two camps i tried it with the same results. I returned it to amazon and they were quick to refund. Postscript:<br />To replace it I decided to stick with the same company but I ordered the wired version as I was afraid of having this expensive safety device stolen.<br />It arrived today with what seemed to be a used item with screws in the cover missing and the remote monitor missing. I don't know whether this problem is with Progressive or Amazon.
502,5,"Worked perfect. Be careful removing the plug from the old sensor, it broke to pieces with one tug."
503,1,Doesn't even stick to the car.  I want my money back.
504,3,"Somewhat disappointed, although probably my own fault for not paying closer attention to description. The strip you see is what you ger: four fairies and four butterflies. I think the item is slightly overpriced, ESPECIALLY since, having purchased multiple of Ms. Thomas' fairy decals by this manufacturer, I know they DON'T hold up to weather, washing. I love her/my fairies, have 2 designs (Blue Nocturne, Morning Dew II) on my car and have replaced damaged/lost decals at least four times since first application in July 2014. I love them, just wish they held up better to the elements."
505,1,wrong
506,5,"The item came promptly. Just as i expected. The 3M double sided types were enough to install  and did not have to use the screws that came with the item. (It requires drilling to the paonted body, dont wanna do that). I have been driving on the freeway amd no problems at all.<br />Because the Jeep Wrangler's wind shield is so flat, the deflector doesn't help much but a little."
507,5,The Reese Tow bar was easy to install and performed flawlessly during a 900 mile trip.  I am very happy with it and would recommend it to anyone needing a tow bar of this type.
508,4,As expected
509,3,Took some work to install but looks great once you get them on
510,5,"I bought this after spending way too much time/energy trying to remove rubber hangers by hand. With this tool and a little bit of WD-40, rubber hanger removal became an easy task. I should have bought this sooner. As for the tool itself, it seems very sturdy and substantial. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is going to replace an exhaust."
511,5,Worked perfectly so we didn't have to fabricate something
512,4,Havent installed it yet but should cure my big red starting problems
513,5,I looked at quite a few bumper stickers and I liked this one the best because it doesn't cut down other 4-W Drive Vehicles...just brags about the one you are driving.  It's also small and not &#34;in your face&#34; like some stickers are.
514,5,I live on a gravel road and so far I'm not seeing dust inside the bed.
515,5,OEM Product for sure.  Fits like a glove in my 2011 Sonata Limited.  Delivered on time as promised.
516,5,"Easy to install,  just take tailgate off, clean the area and attach. My only negative  comment is that I wish it would have came with the splice connector for the reverse light"
517,5,Love it
518,4,Everything fit good but the price was a lil to high .
519,5,Excellent.
520,5,"Would of been nice if instructions were included, but they were still easily installed. Less mechanically inclined people would have a hard time installing these."
521,1,"Cheap, plastic, knock-off crap that reads &#34;Harley Davidsan.&#34;"
522,5,It was perfect I'm satisfied with purchase..
523,5,"When i replaced a waterpump in my 2002 Dodge Ram i used this to put around the Gasket of the pump, it works very well and theres definetly enough to do a waterpump and the thermostat. Its been a couple months and no leaks and no problems. Worked well"
524,5,"It worked perfectly, I'm very satisfied, great buy!"
525,5,"Very precise shifts, awesome feel, about an hour to install."
526,5,Good fit. Quality seems good.
527,4,"Does what it is supposed to , and does it fairly well. My only complaint is that the quality of the sound through the auxiliary input is not as good as it is through the main input.  Don't know why this would be so, but it makes the second input rather useless."
528,5,These were a Christmas gift for my dad and they were exactly as advertised. He loved them!
529,5,"I bought this for my 2010 Subaru Impreza and it fit like a glove. For me, the installation required two people and took about one hour to complete. Very good purchase and highly recommended."
530,5,Great product. Easy to install.
531,5,Very good and easy to use.
532,5,My son is a corvette fan and Owns a C5 vette he loves the hat
533,2,some of the snaps were off the product.  they sent a kit so I could repair it myself.  we'll see. not happy
534,1,"No stars. The sizing is way, way off.  Ordered a size bigger than i normally wear, the jacket fits 3 sizes smaller.  Makes no sense.  Also the sleeves way too long."
535,3,Nyc
536,5,Great for Pacific Northwest riders. Not too bulky but slightly warmer than regular jerseys.
537,5,Great product amazing company
538,2,"I scoured the description to determine exactly how the sockets would stay in place whenever the holder was moved.  NO DESCRIPTION!  When they arrived, I realized what they were and I am VERY disappointed!    The best way to describe this:  Remember when you got your first socket set (all loose, no holder because that cost $)?  You took a scrap board, drove 10d nails just into the surface of the board and wrote the sizes on the base.  Dropped each socket, in order, over each nail and you had a poor mans socket holder/organizer.  That is  E-X-A-C-T-L-Y  what these are!!!!!  Replace the scrap board with a plastic base and the 10d nails with a plastic peg and you have the same thing as the poor mans socket holder/organizer, just a VERY EXPENSIVE version!  I expected some sort of friction/hold for each socket to keep them from sliding off when they are moved/hung vertically, not a slick peg which (unlike a nail with a head) allows the socket to easily slide off.    I use my tools everywhere; my house, sons, daughters, outside on my cars, in the field, at my lot.  Equipment doesn't break down only at my garage!    I have been looking for a socket organizer/holder for years.  I have ½\\"" drive + impact, 3/8 drive, ¼\\"" drive, BOTH SAE and Metric and shallow and deep + special purpose!  I've tried the spring loaded base metal types, high friction base plastic and metal/plastic trays.  Nothing works right (tried magnetic ONCE, magnetized the sockets, EVERYTHING stuck to them).    I guess they would be OK as long as you never moved them, put them in a tool box that could be bumped or tipped on its side.  If you work in a single location and don't need to take your tools with you, place these units on a shelf or drawer of a stationary tool box, they will work great.  They look quite nice and the sizes are easy to read.      Frustrated!  I am debating returning them."
539,4,Yes they fit just fine except the screws were not long enough had to get longer screws
540,5,Great product and fast shipping
541,5,Fit as expected. Brakes seem normal.
542,5,"Nice, heavy duty without overbearing. I like!"
543,5,There is a more &#34;powerful&#34; or &#34;concentrated&#34; formula. just try that one.
544,5,k
545,5,it works great  NO B.S.
546,5,I love these stickers! I also got an extra which was super cool! Wil deff buy from again!
547,3,when using these supports they do not spring up fast very slow.
548,2,"I put this nozzle on a really good garden hose that has machined brass end fittings.  I left the nozzle on the hose for several months and when I tried to remove it from the hose, I could not get it off.  Apparently the brass fitting engaged with the mating aluminum portion of the nozzle, combined with water is a bad combination.  I am not easily defeated by something like this, but I used a wrench (the hose had a wrench flat), pliers, two pliers, two pipe wrenches, vice grips, tapping with a hammer, and heating with a propane torch.  I finally had to cut the hose off at the coupling and install a new repair coupling in my good hose.  Besides that, I prefer a pistol grip type nozzle that is instant on and instant off without a lot of twisting while the spray cycles through all the spray patterns.  Also, this nozzle requires both hands in order to change the spray pattern or to turn on or off.  A pistol grip nozzle is purely one hand operation."
549,5,I will give the accompanying documentation a 3 1/2 stars but the capability of the product is solid and has performed as advertised to date.  Address the nagging gear hunting issue I had with the TRD tune and responsiveness is greatly improved.
550,1,The black color bled into the pills. The pill case is basically not useable. Don't buy it. Wasted money.
551,5,"I've bought a bunch of Weather Pack stuff from DIYAutoTune. I like the company, their service and their products. I've had some Weather Pack parts that just don't seem quite right. I've never had that problem with any of the pieces from DIY. I really like the Weather Pack parts. Old school but they work.<br /><br />I've learned two things working with Weather Pack connectors: Make sure you have the crimper and the release tool. And make sure it's a good quality crimper - not one of the cheap Chinese knock-offs. :( Having both will save you a lot of headaches."
552,5,"Perfect gift for my brother, who is a mechanic. Packaged well. Product as described."
553,2,"Removed the scratches, but now I have giant swirl marks instead..."
554,5,Quick shipping.  Product arrived within 3 days.  Perfect Fit and fully functional keeping the Salt and other crap off my carpet. Very nice product.  Well made by VW.
555,4,Good quality and did the job.
556,2,The picture shows the headers with the metalic/ceramic coating but the part # indicates they are &#34;raw steel&#34;.
557,5,"Perfect!  This is the gasket for the throttle body where it joins the butterfly valve.  I was under the impression it was the BASE gasket--which it is not.  That gasket is reusable.  If you are buying this to clean out the EGR channels, you really wont need it however, its cheap and easy to change while you have that whole thing off the car.  I would buy it and change it.  If you need the base gasket--its a very thick exhaust type gasket--and this is NOT it."
558,5,"Haven't used them hyet....however, they give me peace of mind. I got for my family too, for their console.  We live in Florida and I have a fear with all the waters around us. I want something in my car that can smash out a window quickly for whatever.  Again. Peace of mind."
559,5,Works & looks great!
560,2,Replaced both sides on my Saab 9-3 once the factory ones began to collect moisture inside. The new TYC ones did the same thing! A little bit of clear RTV silicone around the seal and no more moisture intrusion to corrode the light socket. I shouldn't have to seal a brand new product. Fitment was a little awkward but it does stay in place.
561,5,Love the sound of it
562,5,"Replaces our ## Candlepower BIG flood/spot light - you know the kind - super heavy but lights like a train engine. The one that weighs 20 lbs and gets super hot, you know the one....<br /><br />- Super bright concentrated beam<br />- Sufficient ambient light to expand it's usefulness as a flashlight<br />- Charge lasts with our current usage (using morning & evening briefly and charging once per month)<br />- Lightweight<br />- Comfortable to hold<br />- STAYS COOL! You can use it until your heart's content and then set it right down on anything - it stays cool.<br />- Convenient that it's waterproof (didn't think we cared until used in the rain)<br /><br />We love this light - it is just the right size, not bulky at all. Much stronger light than a regular flashlight, not as much light as the old honker light, but it's enough light. The beam length is incredible - wish I could tell you how far it beams, but I'm not good at distances - trust me when I say it has a nice, solid, strong beam for a very good distance. (think suburb living -- it would definitely disturb your neighbor 3 doors down if you shined it into their house from your front lawn......)<br /><br />Thinking of putting one in each of the vehicles - nice that it comes with the car charger.<br /><br />I agree with another reviewer that it should have come with a wrist lanyard since it has the hole for one. That is the only improvement that I would suggest - pretty minor - we'll make our own."
563,5,Awesome
564,3,I am only giving it 3 stars because it was suppose to come with a switch in the kit. It did not have one. Other than that the product is good and shipping was quick.
565,5,Does just what it is supposed to do.  Good quality.  Delivery much faster than promised.  Recommended seller.
566,5,"They look really great but, the ends did pop up. I had to use some, heavy duty auto, double sided tape to stick them down."
567,5,Love this t-shirt!  It looks great on my husband!  Anyone who loves Klim should buy it.
568,4,I purchased this helmet for my son who is 13 years old and occasionally rides on the back of my bike. He loves the helmet has no issues with it for approximately past year. It's a good helmet for the price
569,5,"works well on helmet, much sturdier than original models GRMS X1"
570,5,"Fit my 2012 Jetta GLI Sedan Perfectly.  It's been hard to find wipers for my Jetta. I had previously tried the Bosch 19OE and 24OE (which many sites claim fit my car), they would not fit though due to a plastic ridge that prevents the adapter from sliding into the stock wiper arms.<br /><br />These wipers are a good deal and were very easy to install.  Literally took less than a minute per blade to install."
571,4,"2nd time was a charm... I ordered my first harness and installed it easily using the supplied instructions. I especially liked the idea of the wireless remote and NOT having to run wires through the firewall for a switch.<br /><br />First, I connected my 2 CREE LED lights. I had to splice in 2 additional 16 gauge (red and black) wires in order to power both lights as this kit only has one set of power wires for the lights. This quick and simple alteration gave me 2 pairs of positive and negative connections for my lights.<br /><br />Next, I wired the power... It is basically red wire to the positive battery post and black/negative wire to a suitable ground on the frame of my SUV (I personally do not wire my ground wires directly to the negative battery post).<br /><br />Upon completion and testing, I immediately noticed the remote control was not working properly. It would only work after multiple button presses and would not respond as designed. I had to press the OFF button multiple times to get the lights to turn off. Also, the switching between steady and flashing would not respond properly. Extremely frustrating to say the least.<br /><br />Not to be discouraged, I ordered a second harness on Amazon, and after wiring the new one in, it is working flawlessly. So I simply received a defective remote transmitter and/or receiver in the first kit.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend this item as it was fairly easy to connect and it works great so far. I will update my review if I experience any further performance issues with this new harness.<br /><br />NOTE: If you wire this harness directly to the battery the lights will function without a key in the ignition. Keep this in mind as if you forget to turn your lights off you could come back to a dead battery. Also, the remote is fairly small, and you only receive one, so don't lose it.<br /><br />Thank you"
572,1,"Have these on my 2011 silverado hd and a little less than a year they stopped working. Like other reveiws here i see. tried to contact Kool vue and its parent company perfect fit but neither have contacted me back. Guess they don't care about their customers, just the money. My opinion, spend the extra bucks for a stealership pair of mirrors, at least you could deal with someone in person and not a faceless company. I put my stock mirrors back on and will spring for a set of extenders for CIPA. I gave them one star only because i cant give them -5 stars."
573,5,Great item and fast shipping... Thanks!
574,5,"The Water Sprite is a great chamois. I have used the Water Sprite for many years, and it works so much better than other synthetic chamois.<br />You will be happy with your purchase."
575,5,righton
576,4,"Fits very tight but inorder for it to work correctly you have to have the rail for the top. I removed the rail due to my Jeep never has a top on it, that's what I bought this. Also I have rock sliders on it so the hooks that hold it down wont work. Other then that is well made and seems like it will last."
577,5,Bought this for my dad at Christmas Great Product!!!
578,5,"Made by GM for GM vehicles. It works perfectly, at a great price. I highly recommend it!"
579,5,Perfect!
580,5,I am not an expert but I do have a fair amount of experience working on cars. I have only used noise deadening material once before and it was the Thermo TEC which did an excellent job for my transmission tunnel. I purchased this to do the interior of my 1990 Nissan 300ZX. I was hoping it would help with road noise and exhaust noise and drone. I have to say this is an excellent product and worked great for my application. The exhaust drone is still noticeable but reduced but can't expect a lot to help a full 3&#34; performance exhaust system. It has also helped with the sound of my stereo. I have used two rolls of this material and it is very workable and sticks to most surfaces if they are cleaned before application. I would definitely buy again the next time I have a project. Good product and fast delivery. Sammyb
581,5,Received the tire gage quickly and on time. Great product.
582,1,Was unable to use as it was the wrong filter for my dodge cumins motor.
583,5,I have this on all of my trucks! I like the fact that you can pop open the gate with one hand and let it drop if your hands are full.
584,5,Easy to install however it needed a little adjusting for our Nissan Titan 2004! A great present for the hubby!
585,5,Worked great.
586,5,camair is the best in cartrage dryers
587,5,us this product weekly works great
588,5,TY it was perfect fit and easy to install. We were done in 10 minutes!
589,4,"This is my second bottle, it took two to do the top on my Mini Cooper.  I brushed it on in two coats, using a foam brush.  I have noticed some beading and the top looks a little darker.  Hoping over time it will protect the fabric.  Jury is still out."
590,5,Came fairly quickly. Got them on sale. Work fine.
591,5,Inflates tires fast. I haven't had to repair a flat yet though.
592,4,"they are very bright! even though the glass is colored blue i wasn't expecting them to be as blue as they are, im probably know as the ass with the bright blue lights now.."
593,5,"A little bit taller than a quarter, so it's not flashy or anything like that, but then Kuroko isn't, either! Cute pose and a decent paint job for being so small! Mine is just a bit faded on the top front spike of hair, but not a big deal and still adorable. Check out the pics if you're unsure!"
594,3,Not worth the price.
595,1,I knew I took a chance by ordering this. Opened it up and took it out and all hear was something ratteling inside the speaker box and then the knob falls off. Stay away from this and spend your money on something better.
596,5,Worked great.  Has more power and runs better.  Do wish that the had not changed from a metal design to a plastic one.
597,5,Worked for my generator.
598,5,Bought for my new JD lawnmower key. Very nice and I like it.
599,5,"Noticed instant results. My 2003 Honda Pilot 230k KM felt like it was on steroids. Pick up is now smooth as butter, no emission smoke after driving. Feels as if it helps burn off exhaust so visually you can't see any emissions as before you could always see grey smoke coming out.<br />One bottle lasts 3 fill ups. Have considered ordering more to use a bottle on a monthly basis. The old saying goes makes your car feel young again."
600,5,The best Wiper fluid I have ever tried. Dries quickly and leaves no streaks.
601,5,Did their job well and lasted a lot longer then other brands I bought. I have nothing else much to say really.
602,3,Works
603,5,Original Ford Motorcraft filter for less than a aftermarket knock off filter. Can't go wrong!
604,5,"I love this stuff! Yes it's pricey (it's cheaper on ebay), but honestly there is no other product like it. I applied it on all the exterior black plastic parts of my 2010 Acura TSX (in 2012) and it lasted until I traded the car in (1.5 years!); at the same time I also applied it to my wife's 2010 A5 and it's still going strong. I just tried the ArmorAll \\""Outlast\\"" stuff which is half the price but it's not nearly as good....so purchased more WIPENEW for my 2013 WRX...I put heavy coats on the trim and pillar posts around the car door windows because I wanted them to look glossy and wow...they came out awesome (see pic) - I applied to all rubber trim pieces --- hopefully it keeps them from dry rotting."
605,5,"Our 2003 Chrysler Town and Country's blower fan would only work on high or off.  Found a youtube video on how to replace this thing, and was done in about 10 minutes.  It's been working for about a month and a half now with no problems."
606,1,Does it fit a 94 ford ranger 6cyl
607,5,Higher quality than the gasket that came with my replacement water pump.
608,5,"Fits just great. Easy to install. I was confused at first at the 'ready to paint' options, but this is plain black like the standard one that came with the van, nothing to paint."
609,5,Works perfectly on my 2009 Fusion.
610,5,Perfect for filling the batteries of my golf cart
611,4,"it works, missing some brackets,  all shown were shipped, but i could have used one more support.  had to reuse an old rusted one."
612,1,"Owned it 6 months, and it's completely dead. Rode the bike almost everyday, than one cold spell, and in 2 days, in won't start or take a charge."
613,5,just what I needed without pying $100
614,5,bright and use very little power on solar system
615,5,Saves an awful lot of trouble!!!!!!!! Well worth it.
616,1,horrible save your money and the frustration this product doesn't work at all over all rating -0%.
617,5,Super suds!!!
618,5,Love it !!!!
619,5,"Official-issue filter, not much to say about that.  What's cool is the ease in obtaining it - you Amazon shoppers understand that!"
620,1,"I purchased these headlights for my wifes 2009 Scion XB. The installation was fairly straight forward and took about and hour since the bumper has to be removed. After about 20 days and our first rain in California, the low beam on the drivers side went out, that is when we noticed that water was getting into the housing. I tried contacting RVinylTint to get a replacement but they never checked their voicemails, by the time I got amazon involved they said it was past the 90 day warranty and sorry about your luck. I am currently dealing with the maker SpecDTuning to resolve. I will update as needed. I would not recommend buying these from RVinyl or at least do a seal check before installing. The lights look great when running properly, but as an electrical item that is on the exterior of the car, you would think they would make sure that water, bad for electronics, would not go into the housing."
621,4,This is a really nice little fuse module for the money.
622,5,Supports were as expected and were easily installed
623,3,some didn't work
624,5,Exact factory replacement. Fit perfectly on my 2002 Silverado 1500.
625,1,JUNK WORKED 3 DAYS
626,1,I order the passenger side and got the drivers side
627,5,Very happy with purchase for son's  Halloween  costume.  Good price and quality.
628,5,Perfect fit for my '98 Jeep ZJ with the 4.0 I6
629,5,work as advertized
630,4,smaller than I expected by that's a good thing so they will fit perfecting in the pocket. very nice.
631,1,This doesn't work properly. It puts the sensor after the thermostat which makes it pointless cause if your thermostat sticks closed you won't know your engine is starting to over heat for a while. It also won't tell your gauge that the engine is warming up until the thermostat opens up the first time.
632,5,"These are the best wiper blades I've ever purchased.  Clean line, no streaks!"
633,5,nice product
634,5,Got here fast and it is FUNNY!!
635,5,The picture does not do this justice. For those who wear glasses don't worry these fit right over them.
636,1,It was broken when we got it .
637,2,"Pretty cheap, need to put a washer behind the nut or it will pull through if torque it a lot.  Would probably buy something better so don't have to crawl under and replace in future."
638,4,These surprisingly smell exactly as advertised. My wife has had it in her car for a few months now and the scent of ice cream bars still hits me sometimes.
639,5,Works as advertised
640,5,They work awesome!
641,5,I bought these for my fiancé and he loves them! :) They fit perfect in his 2005 Chevy Avalanche.
642,1,The arms is only 2&#34; wide! Waste off money!
643,5,Just as good as OME part works great
644,4,Is it good.
645,5,We purchased these in preparation of the winter season and so far so good. The product fit perfectly in our MDX and we couldn't be happier.
646,5,"Very well made, fits exactly like the OEM valve cover. Has been on the car for a few months now, has not warped or leaked. Very satisfied with my purchase."
647,5,Fit just right!
648,4,"These are worth every bit of the cost of the kit.  They are a better looking Roundel with the chrome at the edge rather than the rubber of the originals on my e46 and e53.  However, they simply feel less substantial.  I wonder how they will last over a few years of Michigan Winters, but for the price, I might buy a set for Summer and a set for Winter.  They do come well protected - covered in adhesive plastic.  I have already managed to break a small piece of one tab when it jammed instead of popping into the wheel, however, use care and line them up before you give them a good *pop* with the palm of your hand and you should be fine.  The fit is very snug, though the plastic of the tabs does not seem as pliable as the old style."
649,5,These guys sell good products for all of your truck and car aftermarket needs I will purchase more accessories from this company and will tell others as well.
650,5,Fast shipping and perfect fit for 1941 Farmall A
651,5,"This and 2 other stickers went on my car, basically shows how I feel about stupid drivers."
652,3,These don't last very long compared with Dremel's ones. But I guess you get what you pay for.
653,5,Awesome deal and product
654,3,Fit great but the one wire harness was broken insice the socket had to use the old one
655,5,Great fit
656,5,Just what the Dr ordered.
657,3,"They are quite bright and seem constructed well. I like the dual color nature, and the price is reasonable.<br />There are problems though, the mounting clips aren't that secure, there are three small tabs that I'm just not sure will hold up on the road. The other issue is the extension wires are terminated wrong, they don't match up to their same color connections on the unit."
658,5,Nice glasses. You have to be careful with them. They tend to scratch.
659,5,Excelent
660,5,"For the price, you can't find better..."
661,5,Had to take the pump from out of the tank in my 89 Camaro. This works perfect as an out of tank setup. No need for separate relay.
662,5,"I bought this for my 1998  Buick Park Avenue Ultra as the transmission started shuddering while shifting. Took the car to a transmission shop from a partial repair to a full blown rebuild  $350 - $1,800 as they could not pinpoint the problem. So after some research and finding this kit I decided to go for it. After installing the parts of the kit by removing the trans pan only it took care of the problem. This part of the kit took only about an hour and a half to complete.  I am going to get into the other part of the trans and do the rest of the kit as I am having the delayed cold shift until the trans warms up but that will take more time.Those parts and seals are included in this kit also. Saved me a bunch of money!!"
663,5,A little pricey but worked just fine.
664,5,"2nd purchase of this product and again it works perfectly. To clarify, 3 of the sockets can be used for charging and the 4th one is for a cigarette lighter which is not convenient for me as I'm not a smoker but its good to have the option for someone who is."
665,5,"Great price, fast shipping and exactly as described."
666,4,good as advertised
667,1,"Was bought for a 2008 impala, double checked to make sure it was the correct rim, and yesterday found out the hard way it does not fit. Sitting on the side of a four lane road with a flat and no spare. I will be calling on Monday!!!"
668,5,works great
669,5,"Fits great , looks old school"
670,3,"Be aware, if you know how to write in cursive you'll be able to tell that these mirrors actually say &#34;Horley Davrdsan&#34; not &#34;Harley Davidson&#34;"
671,5,"look nice, great price"
672,3,"I got mine while Amazon had the instant $5 rebate going, so only wound up paying about $18 after taxes. Mine did not have instructions, so I looked it up on 3M's site - http://3mauto.com/3m-lens-renewal-kit-with-protectant-39045.html  (hopefully the link posts). The kit has everything you need including the protectant so you won't need to do them again as quickly as you might without it. It's an easy product to use with a drill doing all the work, and the results are almost as good as new for much less cost - plus it keeps another old car part out of a landfill. My headlights were original with the truck, and 15 years old. (Added a picture of before & after, I removed the headlights and worked inside as it was cold & dark outside, and snow is expected any time now)"
673,5,"Only used it a few times so far, works great skidding logs. Tried pulling my heavy duty 3/4 ton crew can up hill in neutral, did great. Only complaint is that the grease gets a bit thick in extreme cold, hard to free spool cable out."
674,5,Great product and fast shipping!!!
675,5,Excelent filter
676,5,ok
677,4,"perfect fit.  Search the local stores, no luck.  Found this baby on Amazon and placed the order, not comparing -- nothing to compare to, it is a one of a kind and worked perfect for down sizing from a 3&#34; to a 1 1/2&#34;.  I change out an obsolete Therford set of dump valves for the, now standard, Valterra valve set.  Unlike the Thetford the gray water side is 1 1/2&#34; size.  Now my plumbing is up to date."
678,5,"I really like this stuff. Did an application to my girlfriend's black car and the paint looks great. It even cleared up a few minor scratches. It also cleaned off of plastic trim relatively easily, although I did get right on it before it dried. The few spots it dried on were more difficult to deal with, but that just tells me the durability should be good. Paint felt incredibly smooth after the application.<br /><br />It did dust some after I cleaned it off, but it was pretty cool out and I had a hard time getting a thin coat going as a result. Still, I could do ten or more cars with this one bottle. It's an excellent all in one, and if durability is good, it'll be my new go to.<br /><br />I'll update this review as time goes on to reflect the durability. The star rating may change if protection goes down hill too quickly. I loved Turtle Wax Ice Liquid Wax to start, but I only got a month of protection out of it, so it currently sits at 2 stars with me. I'm hoping this stuff lasts two months, because that's what I'm aiming for durability wise. Time will tell."
679,3,Works fine and seems to be less costly that other alternatives.
680,5,This works great on car windows and also just about anything else-I have used this to clean windows at the house!
681,5,Work's great fits perfect.
682,5,"Very nice,  great price and easy  fit"
683,1,Very low quality part. The nut stripped off the threads while torquing and rendered the part useless. Went with a higher quality brand...
684,4,Would have given it 5 stars.  But one hext screw had no hole in it- so no way to crank it down. Plus it was missing a locking washer...kind of annoying.  Guess it happens.  Looks AWESOME on my 2015 Silverado.
685,5,Perfect Fit!!! Vega Helmets are the BEST!!!
686,5,Works like a champ.  I have a huge dodge diesel truck and like to keep it clean (no small task out in the country).  I'd been using old towels to help dry after washing because our water is rather hard and leaves spots if not dried promptly.  This towel is 10x better than using an old towel.  It practiaclly looks waxed after drying now.
687,5,Installed in 2008 escalade and works great
688,5,FIT NISSAN MURANO 2011
689,5,"As expected, mirror was new and arrived in good condition.  I'm a repeat customer for this product as this is my second mirror purchase from this site.  My experiences have both been good and I'd recommend them to others."
690,4,I am happy with this product.
691,5,worked as advertised. easy install
692,5,"Fits CX-9 without issue.  (If you have a check engine light go off due the gas cap being loose or damaged, the computer will not automatically reset itself like most cars.  You will need to borrow a code reader from an autoparts store to reset the light)"
693,5,Fits great. Would buy again
694,5,What can I say these are working as advertised on my 2001 Ford Expedition 5.4 fuel injectors. I replaced the intake manifold because of the famous leak they have with 200k miles on her and after 6k miles of use no isssues so far.
695,5,Love it so happy I purchased
696,5,A replacement lid for an original that cracked and fell off.  Four screws to remove the old hinge (all that was left) and four screws back in.  Since it is OK the fit and operation is perfect!
697,4,We carry an emergency supply of Blue DEF in our diesel pusher coach. At $15 for 2.5 gal it is at least twice the price of DEF at Pilot/Flying J truck stops which is usually priced under $3 per gal. Works great for us.
698,5,I have love it...
699,5,I love them .
700,5,Fits perfectly and looks very much like the factory mirror...without the price
701,5,item delivered on time..and has good quality for a small amount compared to others..
702,3,Throttle tube was too small to fit over the handlebar and turn smoothly. I had to sand down the inside of it to keep the throttle from sticking. Then the glue let go letting the outer grip slide around the throttle tube. Had to glue it back down. Worked fine after all of that.
703,5,I prefer this kit to the other one on Amazon. This one has plenty of screws for a vent installation and plenty of butyl tape as well. It worked great for our purposes and I'm happy with the purchase.
704,5,high quality very happy with this rack
705,5,It works better than the original one! Good deal!
706,5,Great product!
707,5,"Easy install, I get 39 MPG average now!"
708,5,"Worked as ordered...dealer wanted $300 to replace it, it took me 5 min after waiting 30 min with battery unplugged."
709,5,Works as advertized
710,2,Quality was good however the actually intercooler had tons of scratches nd even had a huge dent. I returned it Nd I asked for a new one they said all where lick that.
711,5,It's just fits perfected!
712,5,"I replaced a smaller faucet in my pop-up truck camper, the extra height is much more usable. Easily replaced, except for contortions necessary to reach the faucet location which was not the fault of the manufacturer. Looks good, works good, I can now wash my dishes under it rather than with a lavatory faucet. A bit smaller footprint than the old lavatory faucet."
713,5,It is a fun addition to the bike.
714,3,"Box was beat up but filter was fine, though it was missing the o-ring."
715,4,Very good
716,5,Very Easy to put in the window! Good quality. Very Happy
717,5,Came quick.  Perfect fit.
718,1,"Did not pit my honda crv oem size tire (205/70R15), as stated.  Way too small.  Returned it to Amazon."
719,4,worked great in truck
720,5,"Big, dual pile, silk banded. They are a good price for a good thickness microfiber. I use them exclusively to wash my cars using the Gary Dean method and they work great! No regrets. They've gone through half a dozen washes so far and are holding up well."
721,5,Already ued several of the fuses..great to have on hand
722,5,"Tired of all those stick figures, I got this to amuse my grandsons."
723,5,Works great!!
724,5,Perfect fit for replacing faulty oem product.
725,5,Excellent!
726,5,"Great product for its purpose, lock your jeeps hood.<br />Looks nice.<br />Arrived quick.<br />Follow instructions and no problem."
727,5,"Dearest Jeff Bezos,<br /><br />You headquartered Amazon in Seattle.<br /><br />Why not hand these out to Seattle residents like Oprah gives out cars?<br /><br />Love,<br />- Seattle resident who no longer knows what a windshield wiper is."
728,5,Half the cost of others and works just as good.
729,1,Junk pot metal...
730,4,"Love this shirt, it fits a little small - but the color and style is wonderful!"
731,1,"not the right fit for the old one, brittle plastic"
732,5,:)
733,5,Great replacement parts for 01 frontier.
734,1,I received my led lights today and they were not as described. The description was a 10 led light and these are only a 2 led light. Very disappointed. The description of the light should be corrected or else send the correct light.
735,5,I ordered this for my mom's jeep & she loved it. It fits good & looks good.
736,3,"It works, but it's very short lived. A few days if you're lucky before you need to re-apply it."
737,5,this is good
738,5,I love it
739,5,Great shoes...comfortable!  Ordered a half size larger for a perfect fit.  Has great support!
740,5,Great price
741,5,Excellent
742,1,i did not like it because smell when ac turn on.
743,5,Fit perfectly and shipped with no problems. Prime makes the purchase very quick and easy.
744,3,"Very difficult to replace on a PT Cruiser, bad design by Chrysler, but mechanic installed it and it worked fine."
745,4,A very nice console for the price.  Used in a CJ7.  The rear bracket was not quite high enough; i used the bracket from the console being replaced.
746,2,"it's nice, but it broke the first week."
747,5,My grandson loves his shin guards.
748,5,a
749,5,Cheaper than from repair shop and easy to install
750,5,Perfect fit. Very pleased with the product. Heavy duty.
751,5,Fit perfectly but had to bend the very end of the cable slightly so it would catch gear wheel when installing it. Radio reception is clearer and picks up distant stations much better than old antenna.
752,4,"Arrived very promptly.  Didnt seem to be self leveling, it stayed in a 'pile' and didn't fill in the cracks very vell, had to smooth out with a putty knife.  Installed in 70 degree plus tepms so it should have been warm enough, maybe it was a bit old.  Had the camper out in a rain storm this weeekend and no leaks so it is doing its job."
753,4,I agree on this item I think everyone should have one
754,5,"Using this bag just for school right now. Very comfortable, holds laptop very well, enough space for every day use. Holds laptop and a lot more pace for books. Can't wait to ride with it."
755,5,"Works great. You have to 1. take the old lock cylinder out 2. Take out the tumblers of the old cylinder and keep in order (1 at a time, be very careful) 3. match the old tumblers with the new tumblers (tumblers are stamped with a number, match with new tumbler) 4. Put new tumblers in new cylinder in the same order as the old tumbler were in old cylinder. Pretty much it. Left out some instructions, but wanted to share this part of the process, I had to figure out on my own. Took me a while but would be very easy to do next time."
756,5,"Perfection. Smooth, streamlined look and fit."
757,4,Perfect fit for what I need. Some of the lights not as bright as others.
758,5,great

760,4,"The fuel pump was delivered about a week after it was ordered, and<br />I installed the assembly a couple of weeks ago. It's been working fine so far. It took the the better part of a day to do but a helper would shorten the work time."
761,5,Very pleased with this purchase
762,5,"Great product!  Used their leather cleaner first on a 23 year old Mercedes with light grey leather interior - cleaned up like new.  I then conditioned the seats, following the instructions exactly as on the bottle, and it left the seats, door panels, etc. very soft and supple, and a nice sheen to it.  I did not have the experience that it left the surface tacky - I was very careful to clean it thoroughly first, apply the conditioner sparingly - and most importantly, 24 hours later, wiped everything down with a clean, dry cloth - that eliminated any remaining conditioner still sitting on the surface.  I did the entire interior of this very large car  - two front seats, large bench seat in the rear, and fairly large leather panels on each of the 4 doors - and you can barely tell any is missing from the bottle - I could probably condition this interior 20+ times on a single bottle.  I definitely recommend it, and will be a life-long customer.  Great product, and great communication from the seller.  Get some - but make sure you follow the directions."
763,5,"Great product. I tried it two times with my 2010 Ford Explorer and did great job. Even I used it with all my devices, IPad, laptop, and two more phones and it charged them completely. A great tool andI realy recomend it."
764,4,Pretty good
765,5,good
766,4,"Easy to install, not enough wiring to go under the radiator like I wanted to, but it works and is out of the way of heat and such. Lights look sweet"
767,5,Right product. Great price.
768,5,Clear instructions. Very good results obtained in about an hour.
769,5,"Fits like a glove. Keeps my car a lot cooler and UV protects my dash board. Some thought it was hard to install and remove, but I find it to be no problem after using those that you have to know magic to be able to fold them to put away. All in all, I am very pleased with the product and will look to purchase others of the same brand for my other vehicles."
770,5,"Good looking (very unconspicious), easy to use, very versitile. Great value.  I transport odd shaped construction supplies every day for work and this system allows me to put a tie-down point exactly where I need it. At 93&#34; long it is the perfect length to center in an 8 foot bed and still be able to easily slide a ring in the track from either the front or the back."
771,4,Easy install and corrected problem.
772,5,Very fast shipping!  High quality product!
773,5,Beats the parts store by a lottttt! Much cheaper for the same thing!
774,4,Great item could be pre cut for speaker wires
775,4,I installed this on my scooter and it isn't all that easy to read in direct sunlight but it does what I need. I can see when I'm drawing too much power and it has helped me adopt some habits that should keep my battery happy. got it for $11(ish). I like the look Im going to get something similar to display the revs and maybe eventual the engine temp too. Took off a star because it came with a scuff on the right side of the display would buy again though.
776,3,did not use
777,5,"I have used this tire pressure gauge many times now on my summer tires and winter tires. It is super easy to use, very easy to read, and I love that it comes with the little bleed-off valve so that I can easily bleed some air out of a tire and get it to exactly the correct PSI."
778,5,Fit good and sound mean
779,4,Worked as expected. Fixed an hyper flashing signal LED. The plastic slices are not high quality and might require stripping of the wire before installing (that's the reason of a star deduction) . A simple push was not enough to pierce through the plastic shielding of my car's cable.<br />I used foamtape to fix it on a metal surface inside the carpeting in the trunk.<br /><br />Warning: these things heat up! Be mindful of prolonged usages. Make sure it's not touching other cables or plastics (or fuel lines etc).<br /><br />The cables has string made shielding on top of the multi strand plastic coating. Nicely shrink tubed at the points it is connecting to the body of the heatsink.
780,5,These mirrors are great. Clean & clear. The suction cup is awesome. It allows you to put the mirror wherever you want!
781,4,Works Good
782,5,"Great product and great service. I bought this as I go crazy when I see a loose piece of wire with a plug dangling from the back end of a vehicle, not pretty and not safe. This product solved that problem nicely on my Toyota Landcruiser."
783,5,gret stuff
784,5,"Great air filters, I used them a lot - quite convenient and appear to be solidly made."
785,5,really good!!
786,5,"Very reasonable price, and it serves the purpose."
787,5,Key chain is well made and sturdy.  I was hoping for the color to be different (synergy green) but it's as depicted which is fine.  Would recommend to anyone interested in a Chevy Camaro SS key chain.
788,1,This did not fit our 2011 Veracruz. ANCO needs to correct this information!
789,4,"I used this pump to fill my baseboard hot water heating system with 15 gallons of polyethylene glycol (PEG) antifreeze.<br /><br />The pump intake hose was too short to reach the bottom of a 5 gallon container the PEG came in.  I used a piece of old garden hose to solve that problem.<br /><br />During the filling procedure, the pump output hose slipped off the pump causing a loss of antifreeze.  I solved this problem by using a hose clamp to to secure the output hose to the pump.<br /><br />The pump output hose nipple is a poor design.  It is a simple piece of straight plastic with nothing to help grip the hose.  If you want a secure, leak-proof connection, plan on adding a clamp.<br /><br />The pump operated as designed and had excellent output."
790,4,Fits on my keychain and since I bought it and has not fallen off nor stabbed me. Construction is good.  But removing it from the holder is a matter of a little practice:  you must squeeze the tweezer together to lift it off a locking stud on the holder.  Not a one handed operation for me yet.  But this is also why it doesn't fall out of the holder and go missing.
791,5,"I bought new 4&#34; speakers for my Sprinter Van dash to replace blown ones. They are well reviewed, but I wasn't getting the sound (part of a bigger install). I trimmed these to fit the dash, it was a tight fit but really mellowed out the mids. Very happy."
792,5,We love this!  It's perfect for our family because we don't have to store a Thule hard shell somewhere while not in use.  This bag saved our sanity this summer!!!
793,5,"Works as expected. Loosens tough, stuck screws without stripping the heads."
794,1,"Worthless piece of crap. I used this torque wrench once for torquing the wheels on a minivan. I set it for 100 ft pounds and I immediately knew something was wrong. The indicator didn't go off until well beyond 100ft pounds. I know this because I struggled to get it to go off. 100 foot pounds is not a lot at all and I was fatigued after the first wheel. I later broke the studs trying to get the wheel off. The threads were clearly stretched and I had to replace every stud on the vehicle. I thought perhaps I had done something wrong so finally after the studs were replaced and the wheels were going back on I turned the wrench on and it displayed 30 ft pounds with no torque applied to it. In a rage I threw this useless breaker bar into the ground. To my surprise the plastic casing didn't break. Impressive. I didn't need to use the tool until weeks after I bought it so I had no idea it was defective. Its past the return date so this was an effective way of wasting 100 bucks. You couldn't pay me to even use this tool again, and I absolutely don't recommend it."
795,5,It fits my 2014 Rav4 perfectly.
796,5,awesome design
797,5,Looks great!
798,5,Great gauges!  Work awesome ! For sure buy from here
799,3,"Best Price I Could Find Right Here . I Was Surprised At How Cheaply Made The Well To HEI Adapter Is Though Its Literally Like A Screw You Could Get At The Hardware Store With Some Wire Wrapped Around One End , Then Stuck Through A Piece Of Plastic. Next Time If I Ever Need One Of Those Guys , Im Gonna Just Make It Myself ...Love The MSD WIres Though....Really Everything Else They Make....The Adapter Deal Though Meh.."
800,5,"I'm using these to load our RZR into pickup and onto Deck of toyhauler.  Great ramps, Sturdy construction.  I think the RZR is at the upper limit of the load capacity and they don't flinch.  Fold and fit under the quad easily.  The three &#34;tangs&#34; that hold the ramp on the end-gate / trailer deck are welded very well, and they are about 3/8&#34; thick aluminum.  I was concerned that they would flex and bend, but they are plenty strong enough.  They do come with cinch straps that I use 100% of the time. I've seen too many You-Tube videos of a ramp sliding out.  The straps are connected pretty far back which made them too short to reach the underside of my pickup bumper, so I just un-looped them and attached them further forward now plenty long."
801,5,Good product. Good price. Shipped promptly.
802,5,Positive Insulated Battery Power Junction Post. These junction posts work perfectly for my terminal post requirement.
803,2,Product did not fit my vehicle - the number of tabs was different from my vehicle. They were good about returning and issued me a refund.
804,5,Better than expected. The lead posts slide out of the housing for easy wire installation. Fits in my camper hatch nicely.
805,5,They work great.
806,5,"The bulb was a snap to seat.  Its performance passed my own inspection, and the truck got its state inspection sticker with all flags flying.  Kudos to Amazon's website for warning me that a similar 3157 or 4157 bulb (4157 = long-life version of 3157) would not work on a 2006 Mazda B2300 pickup."
807,5,I got these fog lights for half the price and they work perfect. They came with everything my mechanic needed to install them. They just snapped into place!
808,1,Yawwwwnnnn! !  !
809,5,"Operates a little warmer than I expected, brighter than the incandescent bulbs they replaced, same warm white color."
810,5,Great bag and great service.  Second T bag product I have purchased.  They are top of the line.  Perfect fit and functionability.  Completely weatherproof.  Best bags on the market.
811,5,"excellent product, fits perfect on my 07 chevy."
812,5,You have to custom wire these into I am pretty sure any vehicle don't expect plug and play.  That being said the seller was great with accepting my return.
813,5,Fit perfectly in my 1995 Trans Am LT1.
814,5,"Perfect fit, great price."
815,5,thanks
816,5,nice filter
817,5,Been using Mobil 1 15w-50 in my 1966 389 for over 20 yrs...
818,5,Easy installation.
819,5,Love it.
820,5,Works fine
821,3,went bad after 6 months
822,5,"Product arrived before estimated delivery, very surprising. A thumbs up! This starter fit perfectly on my 73 evinrude 65 hp. Easy 5 minute job. Installed the three bolts, power cable, turned the key and she fired right up! No complaints."
823,5,great
824,5,Solved my problem.
825,1,Faded out and crackedwithin 2 months
826,5,Like very good
827,5,It's nice product. Quality is high.
828,5,Perfect fit giniune honda
829,4,He like it thank you.
830,3,"Paint color has metallic so does not match my black car exactly, instructions in Korean so can not read, look at the pictures and guess. Worst of all after about 2 weeks tape on left side of spoiler has came unattached so the adhesive does not do the job. Overall disappointed in this product."
831,1,Starter was grounded on the inside and almost caught the engine on fire..
832,4,Great
833,1,"My daughter brought them out to me. I started fitting them from the front passenger seat went around back and when I got to the front driver side looked at the front and it was filthy and all scuffed up. I looked at the others and they were worn I was so busy cutting and fitting from behind I didn't even notice the front of it. When I went back and checked the package it was opened and all ripped up. It was my own fault for not checking them before I put them in. Now I have 3 cut to fit and a filthy very used driver mat. Check the mats before you put them in to see if there used and send them back. Now I'm stuck with used mats. I know that's what there for, but I didn't need to pay for used mats. How do I send them back now that there cut. The company should have checked the return before resending them out. I am very disappointed with them.They were used and scuffed all up and used. I will never buy from this company again."
834,5,Was exactly what we wanted. Very pleased.
835,5,"Just what I ordered. Cut it at Locksmith, had delaership program it and no problems.  It it a hollow head key meaning it is not solid rubber/plastic like OEM key."
836,5,Just what I wanted / needed. fits perfect and keeps awining tight agents my trailer
837,2,Don't know if it's the product or just the funky way they had to design this to work with the Polaris RZR900.  The pulley doesn't allow the cable to re-spool properly on the winch and causes a lot of problems.  Tried the synthetic rope with this and it worked better except it seemed to put extra strain on the rope and cause premature failure.
838,5,Great Charger I have two of them one for my motorcycle and one for my show car
839,5,"Product appears to be very well manufactured. It will scratch if roughly handled, but appears to holding up quite well with all the keys I have on this key ring."
840,5,PERFECT!
841,4,"I bought this at least a year ago since I normally get punctures at least once per year, but finally got to use it this weekend. First, the handles are a big improvement over the plastic handled tools I formerly used.  Luckily my first repair attempt was in the relative comfort of my garage.  The first problem is the file tool to open and enlarge the hole to fit a plug in has kind of a rounded point, and even with my muscular 210lb body driving to drive the point through the belt I couldn't do it, while having no problems with previous tools.  Luckily I still had the cheap tool with a small, sharp point to get the job started.  I need to grind this one to a point - not a big deal.  Then, after working the hole to what is normally a decent size to plug I realized their plugs were much larger diameter than what I was used to using, and again, my muscles could not work that darn plug in no matter how hard I tried, even after trying to work the hole larger.  I ran out to Walmart in my other car and bought a pack of more normal size plugs and got them in both holes no problem.<br /><br />So,this is a good deal for a cased, metal handled tool, however spend a few bucks more for smaller plugs and sharpen the point if yours is like mine.  This would have been a bad experience if I was out some place."
842,5,"Strainer works well, arrived in a timely manner."
843,5,"Overall a nice product for the intended use.  I installed these on a 2009 2dr Rubicon and I would rate the install as EASY.  Yes I did have to rasp out one of the bolt holes just a bit, but you need to expect some tweeks when you're dealing with type of install.  Install took approx. 1 hour by myself with only minor hand tools.  I purchased mainly as a side step with minimal rocker panel protection (mostly from stumps, logs and trees), also finishes off the rocker panels very nice.  If you're looking for true &#34;rock rails&#34; this is not the product for you; however, if you do mild wheeling and want to finish off your exposed rocker panels with added benefit of a side step, then this fits the bill !"
844,5,Recieved sooner then predicted date and very happy with the packages. Good quality stickers!
845,2,They didn't really fit well and I struggled to put them in for about 20 minutes and gave up.
846,4,Exactly as described.  Easy to install.  Make the bike look nice.
847,5,Cool worked great
848,4,"I bought the item because my driver's side window kept getting stuck when it was rolled down and I'd try to close it. The item works as it should, but unfortuately didn't fix my problem, which looks to be an issue within the door itself. Good product at a fair price."
849,1,Bad item
850,5,Looks well made and would buy again.
851,1,"They look decent... but get stuck on your valve stem.  When i needed to put air in my tire i went to remove the cap and it snapped my valve stem clean off, had to buy a new TPMS valve!"
852,4,This this item was shipped on time and exactly as advertised. I am confident in giving this vendor excellent feedback. I was totally satisfied and wouldn't hesitate recommending them.
853,1,This is a horrible cargo trailes. Its bounces so bad that it mess up our bumper And tore up a$ 400.bike also . I would not recommend this trailer.
854,5,These were easy to install and made it super easy for my husband to get the boat back onto the trailer solo. We would definitely purchase these again!
855,2,Was an amazon open box deal and one of the bulbs was burned out. Otherwise everything was a-ok
856,5,Having locks all keyed the same is great!
857,5,It works perfectly
858,4,fits pretty good  easy to install and was  inexpensive.
859,5,"I ordered 2 and after I got them in and saw how well they worked I ordered 4 more for our other boats, very good lights real bright and easy on the batteries"
860,4,"Great tire brush, I didn't give 5 stars simply that I wasn't floored by it.  but then again, it is a tire brush, not sure what can be done to wow me!  Reliable and does a great job, recommend.  Recommend using with [[ASIN:B003UT3S6Q Sonax (230200-755) Wheel Cleaner Full Effect - 16.9 fl. oz.]]"
861,5,Love it fitted my bac sit just right can't complain thanks!!!!!
862,5,"It's actually kind of bigger than you'd expect, but I got used to it. Get it if you're an M person :)"
863,3,"Although the paint color was an excellent match, applying the paint proved to be harder than I expected.  It took several coats to fill the rock ding in my hood.  It is NOT smooth by any means.  It is a lot less noticeable, however."
864,2,"My son tried these and they were very difficult to use which makes them useless. I can usually get myself out when I get stuck, but worry about him. They have to be used in a precise manner and in the dark of night are a hassle to figure that out."
865,5,I am impressed with the quality of these covers considering the cost! They fit my husbands Chevy perfect and for the price if he ruins them it's not a big loss!
866,4,My only issue is the treads are a little weak!  Ended up having to replace the new accumulator and old evaporator because I over tightened the b nut and stripped the treads.  Guess my old man strength was at its peak today!
867,5,Fits great and a great quality product
868,5,"these bulbs are incredable, BUT they use so little juice that they will  NOT work the clicker realay with out a shorting out device to burn up enough (lots) more juice. I use them for brakes, back up, license, cargo, interior lights..Newest cars do not use heavy juice using bulbs....learned this stuff the hard way..."
869,5,"A breeze to install and a perfect fit.  Love that I could remove my separate choke switch and use the new push to choke feature on the ignition switch.  The new switch came with a wiring diagram, but I also tagged the wires before removing them from the old switch."
870,5,It was awesome! I was going to try and wear it when ever I get on a motorcycle! I use it for cosplay now!
871,1,"Waste of money. Received this item and my husband threw out the packaging. Set it up to use and couldn't get any paint to spray. Inspected it better and found a dead bug logged inside of it. removed the bug. Tried to use it again and paint was bubbling out of the holder. All I did was make a big mess with this item. Couldn't return it, due to lack of packaging. My husband looked it over and there was something bent inside of it. He said that this was the reason that it was bubbling up. Bought another sprayer for cake decorating. $13.00 and worked like a charm. I don't recommend this item."
872,5,Really happy with it!
873,1,Its very weak. It could not hold the laptop weight.! Really its very weak. I requested return.
874,5,Product worked well. Gauge is very accurate. Ergonomic handle was easy to use.
875,5,Worked well on my Maxima 2000 SE. It's a LOT bigger than the pictures make it seem but doesn't intrude. I have had it for a few weeks and just leave it plugged in. No issues with the battery so far.
876,5,"Worked great on our 2004 Chrysler T&C.  Perfect fit, with no issues installing."
877,3,Good while it lasted. The LEDs began to flicker after about 2 weeks of usage. Re-seated in the socket and also tested in another vehicle. However both LEDs kept flickering. Possibly due to a solder joint or lack of a heat sink on the LEDs.
878,5,It is awesome... fits perfect.
879,4,Works great.
880,5,I have tried several types of additives and found the best with best line.Highly recommend this product.  They could put everybody out of bussiness. If everyone knew about it.
881,5,Excellent quality. As described.
882,5,This kit looks great and works really well in a 2003 Mazda Protoge5 transmission.
883,3,fit loosely
884,5,"I had one of these on my Last Tacoma, Very easy to install as long as you have a correct tools. You will need both Metric Torx and Allen head tools. Took me about a half hour by myself. Highly recommend this Tonneau Cover."
885,5,I use the stands for occasional weekend use for Tacoma truck and jeep. Jack stands seem well built and functions are smooth and intuitive.  I have no complaints.
886,4,Not a perfect fit at all.still happy that I got it. Very nice quality.
887,5,No more pushed out screens! And no more screen clips falling out every time you use the door.
888,5,"This is exactly what I needed for my 2004 Explorer.  I had intermittent/rare cruise control.  The abs light would come on anytime I accelerated quickly and stay on until I turned the vehicle off.  Cruise control may have been tied to acceleration and/or hard braking but I can't say with complete certainty.  The dealer was no help and couldn't tell me the source of the problem or why they were getting the codes they did.  (U1900, C1805, C1440 and B2900)<br /><br />After a quick online search and finding others with similar issues, I decided to try replacing this pressure switch.  It took 2 minutes to replace and now the cruise control works perfectly every time and no more abs light.  Apparently some Ford trucks had a recall on this switch, but I checked the 2004 Explorer and it doesn't appear to be covered in the recall.<br /><br />If you are having a similar problem, save yourself the trouble of dealing with a &#34;service department&#34; and try this part first.  Order here, because the local auto parts chain stores do not have this and cannot get it."
889,4,Thought the &#34;grippers&#34; on the back would be longer as on the original Toyota mats. Misleading.
890,3,For the Y-pipe being engineered the way it splits into duals doesn't seem like it wouldn't  flow very well. It kind of dead ends with two holes for it to flow out. It could be that they made it that way to create a little back pressure too. Other then that the welds look good.
891,5,Motorcraft is the way to go.
892,4,"Works very well to add premix oil to my RX-7. Nice to have the top to seal it for storage, as it's impossible to get all the oil out after use. I like that there's a plug at the tip as well as the rotating valve at the bottom of the reservoir."
893,5,Look's great! Super helpful people & fast shipping ! Would highly recommend :)
894,4,Nice boots. Very comfortable and supportive.
895,4,Kit was easy to install and works fine...
896,4,"These provide excellent traction for hauling sheets, much better than my Gill, Harken, or Ronstan gloves. The anti-slip layer on the palm wears out quickly if used for racing and they do slip a lot if very wet, but I buy them again anyway because I need excellent traction on the bow."
897,3,"The hitch is great - good quality, good finish and workmanship. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the sticker on the tongue that needed to be removed before install. Plastic coated sticker tore apart and goop stayed on the tongue. C'mon Reese - don't miss a detail like this to give me a negative experience! I tried acetone, then finally turpentine to get the crap off. If you are going to go cheap on the sticker on the product, at least tell us in the instructions what to use to remove it!"
898,1,doesnt break down very well
899,3,The brake light function (2nd contact) seems a bit dim in the rear direction.  It does light up the side SMDs and it gets brighter but I'd rather have more of them pointing backward in a motorcycle application.
900,5,"OEM replacement for my motorcycle, original lasted nine years because it was kept in good charged condition. So why not put the identical battery back in! Easy to install electrolyte. Don't forget the initial charge. comes with fresh hardware set. Price was good."
901,5,"perfect, fast and just as described"
902,4,Looks great. Came without any scratches on it. The only problem I had was that the holes were a little to small. I used a file to open them up (took about 10 min after my frustrations of them being too small) and then it fit perfectly.
903,5,"Combined with the matching saddle bags these are a great way to get some storage on you motorcycle.  Pretty inexpensive compared to many options out there.  I have a 1997 Kawasaki Ninja 500 and these fit fine!  There are enough straps to make these fit on almost any bike.  That said, my brothers 2002 Kawasaki Ninja might not work &#34;well&#34; with these.  I would bet however you can adjust these to make something work if needed."
904,5,"Great parts, and great customer service, had no problems with any of the parts,<br />And I order 4 struts,and the work fine, great awesome prime choice auto partS.thanks"
905,4,good quality. the only problem is it doesnt have the center speaker cut out. so I will make my own.
906,5,excellent
907,5,Fits 2003 Passat Wagon Rear Wiper - although it isn't listed for it
908,5,Amazing price and great quality!! Very satisfied!!!!
909,5,A+
910,5,good  product  and  very  fast  shipping  and  correct  parts.
911,5,Good to deal with
912,5,very affordable and reliable switch.
913,4,they work
914,5,"These were not as easy to install as the one piece ones I used on my old car, 12 yrs. ago.  If these last as well as the others, I will be very happy."
915,2,"Affordable, but this thing sure is finicky! I realize this is a bargain basement price for a great tool, but this thing barely works! Or rather, it works under such a slight set of circumstances that it was useless to me. I'm not sure if it's just a cheap model, or if it only works under perfect conditions, but I had 4 or 5 jobs I needed to do with this one, and it barely handled one of them.<br /><br />Maybe I needed a strobe tach or something high end, but this didn't cut it! Be careful what you buy it for as it will only work under the most basic tach conditions (like a spinning car tire or something similarly basic with direct access and very close proximity)!"
916,5,very good product nice and durable
917,5,Got them painted looks great!
918,5,Looks very nice on '02 impala
919,4,"Ordered two of these- when they arrived, one of the boxes was already opened.  Contents seemed to all be there.  Got FJ torn apart and one side in- next side come to find out (the open box) the plastic sleeve was missing the spacer at the top, so I had to fabricate one.  If I had known that something was missing- would have sent back.  Shouldn't be selling open box items as new.<br />Was in no position to disassemble and put old ones back on at the point in the day."
920,4,Texture was perfect. The material looks cheaper but its good.
921,5,"Fit great, easy to install. Fixed our window problem in under an hour."
922,4,Nice craftsmanship. No bolts came with it but I was aware of that by other reviews. Looks nice on my bike.
923,5,Fits Great. Looks good. Fast shipping.
924,5,"Excellent light output, simple to install. Definitely superior to previous gen LEDs. Can't comment on reliability or longevity yet."
925,1,don't but you put it on cant get if off leaves a film spent three hours trying to get if off will not come off will have to use something else to get if off  crap crap
926,5,"Great cleaning cloths. From the kitchen to the garage. I use them for detailing my bike, computer screens and kitchen sink,etc."
927,5,"Power Sports Unleashed LLC went the extra mile when USPS did not deliver my order on time, and sent me a second order through priority mail.  The Tusk rear window fits and looks great on my RZR."
928,4,"Great value if you are in need of cheap, yet durable sunglasses. The lenses are not polarized, but seem to be good for the price. Glasses tend to fog when not moving and as other reviews mention fit on the smaller side."
929,5,Came super fast and was everything I expected
930,3,I like i got one to stick but the other side .....got get sum gule or sum thing for it .......
931,5,exelent
932,5,Bolted on in no time and works perfectly
933,5,great price  and works great
934,3,"This element was wider than the stock one and required longer fasteners which are difficult to find,in addition you must limit the travel of the fastener into the backing plate or the element may be crushed by enthuastic tighteners."
935,5,Quite an assortment. Well made. The hooks are plastic so nothing to create scratches. Cord is molded into the plastic hook. A grand value compared to other choices.
936,4,Very easy and simple to install. Giving four stars because the instructions were not detailed enough for a rookie to install.
937,2,Get the metal one.
938,5,This Bulldog is AWESOME. Will be riding in the back seat of my Cooper S.
939,5,this unit worked on many of my cars and trucks!
940,5,"We have a 2011 Hyundai Sonata 2.0T with a little over 60k miles. The original pads help up well, but I didn't want to pay dealer prices for a new set of brakes. I tried an &#34;OE Replacement&#34; kit from Powerstop and they were horrible, and I pulled them off in less than a month. I Installed these pads with the Raybestos premium rotors and couldn't be happier."
941,4,Works great!
942,1,I trusted Amazon and didn't check the review of this filter. It didn't fit Camry 2007 LE once I put it in.
943,5,"Perfect!! Was so happy to have found this on Amazon.....Would like Auto-tech to contact me, to see if i can buy the same strip for both my doors, and front end. Thanks so much for the GREAT service!!!  10 * * * * * * * * * *"
944,5,"nice fuel line at a good price, its flexible and doesnt kink easy which is very nice! has a blue tint to it but you can still see the fuel."
945,2,TURN BROWNNESS !!!!
946,4,"these are nice replacement passing lights, and much cheaper than the Harley shop. if you need a replacement, I would recommend these."
947,5,Thanks to these bulbs I can see a deer quarter mile away easy!!! Only bulb I recommend to family and friends! Will buy again
948,5,"If you have a dark color car you will love this product.  Easy on and easy off.  When you wipe off the haze you will say wow.  I did and I told my friends!  Great product.  I highly recommend.  I used it on a blk CTS-V, Silver s550 and metallic lt blue s430.  All of them looks like a mirror."
949,1,"I've bought a few of these covers for a couple of motorcycles, and they have all fallen apart. The sun bleaches them out, then the fabric on top gets thin and tears. Not one has lasted an entire year."
950,5,"I ordered this for my cousin and thought that she would have to take it to the car dealer to have it set, but she set it herself by reading the instructions that are included,"
951,5,Very nice gloves more than i expected. I would recommend them to anyone who rides. They add a measure of safety to riding.
952,5,"I got this for my son who is going off to one of the Service Academies shortly. Apparently, it's the bomb and works better than all the other products. It came highly recommended to us."
953,4,Its been over a month and so far so good. Packaging was great. Very easy to install with no adjustment. Great Price too. Would give it 5 stars if it last a yr lol.
954,5,The doorhandle is quality made and easy to replace will most definitely be buying more products from them in the future
955,1,Looked good she. I put it on no gas was going into the fuel bowl.  There was something blocking the gas once I cleared it out it pored gas into the engine causing it to lock up.
956,4,"I often drive home from work into the sun and have used this for the past 2 weeks.  This product works well, sticking to my windows without a problem and only moving when I move it.  It's clear and doesn't get in the way of driving.<br /><br />My route home does have a lot of curves, and I do find myself having to move it around to follow the sun; this would be the main aggravation, but this is not a fault of the product.  It would be nice to have two of them (one for the front window and one for the driver's side window), but it's a bit pricy for that.<br /><br />Also, the sticker on the inside to help with removal seems pretty flimsy but that's a minor gripe.<br /><br />Bottom line:  I'd miss it if it were gone.  I quite like it."
957,1,"I would actually give this zero stars.

958,5,"Good quality floor mats of thick material compatible to ones you would pay twice as much for at stores. Fit our van fine and should fit any vehicle. If not, would be easy to trim."
959,5,"I bought a car not knowing you could not even get a visor with an extender, they They don't even make them. Got on Amazon and looked because if it's made Amazon has it. Yay there was what I wanted, not high tech but what was needed."
960,5,better than expected<br /> right what we had been looking for to fix my sons bike and get him back up and running
961,5,"Love the way this looks on my 94 Fatboy.  Much better look than the stock, flat plate.  Definitely worth the money"
962,5,Item was perfect! It was exactly what was needed without hunting it down at a local retailer and reat deal as well!
963,5,"It works, but you need skills to get it right and not pull off the paint or even put mor little dents in it around the suctions."
964,4,I didn't order these expecting an amazing set of  high quality  riding glasses.  I got what I expected which is three pair of decent quality glasses that fit and perform reasonably well at a great price.
965,2,Tried installing into  my s10 ls 4.4 had difficulty with the key.  The alignment of the keys were way to steep.  Couldn't get it done right.  Also the keys needed to be ground down on the top to be installed correctly.  Unless you have a machine shop in your garage get a better set
966,1,the back of the lights have scratches on the housing. 2 out of the 6 lights have burnt out led's. not pleased at all with them.
967,4,"The hose, which was soft and pliable, fit without any modifications.  It was a welcome replacement.  I would buy it again."
968,4,Fits better than any other cover I've had but still don't cover the bottom back part of the bike with all bags attached. If I  remove the Givi trunk on the back it should fit perfectly. I do however Recommended it.
969,5,It was easy to install on my ladder and held two bicycles. I used extra budgie cords to hold the bicycles from moving during travel. This extra securing might not be necessary but it looked like it was needed to me.
970,4,"This is a nice tonneau cover, and the cover itself appears to be fairly high quality (it should be, I found it a little pricey)(actually, I found all that I looked at a little pricey). As advertised, it was relatively easy to install, but there were a couple of issues that were perhaps fairly unique to my truck, which is a 2014 Nissan Frontier with the longer bed, and it came equipped with the Utili-Track system. I discovered that the Utili-Track would prevent me from tightening the front clamps, which use basically large plastic thumb screws to tighten them. This was problem number 1, which I solved by removing the front sections of the track (there are two sections on each side). They're secured by bolts which require the use of a T40 Torx bit to remove them (which is not a common tool). The space is needed to turn the large thumbs screws (think of a very large plastic wing nut), but you can actually re-install the track if you want once the clamps are tight. I decided to leave it off since I'm guessing that there may be times when I'll want to take the cover right off and expose the whole truck bed. I'll probably bolt a couple of rings or hooks to the weld nuts on the side of the bed that held the track.  Problem number 2 was with the spring loaded rear clamps that hold the rear section down when closed. Basically, they weren't long enough. Even when fully extended (pulled all the way down), the lip on the clamp was above lip of the bed rail which it needs to hook on to. Fortunately, I was able to recover from this by lowering the nut on the bolt which holds the whole thing together (you would need a deep 10MM socket to do this) which allows the clamp to be pulled further down. It now just makes it, but it works. I haven't decided whether or not I'll contact the company to see if they make longer rear clamps. The nut is as far down on the bolt as possible, and though it is a lock nut, I'm not convinced that it won't loosen up in time. I had to use the supplied foam weather stripping on the front since I could see quite a bit of daylight when I looked forward (below the cover) with the cover tightened down on the bed. It's a good looking unit, and as of right now, I'd probably still buy it again."
971,5,Fit my 245R70 19.5 tires perfectly.  Easy to install and remove.  Look good (even match my coach somewhat).  Nice storage case included.
972,5,It was easy to install and really cute in person. I love it and I would recommend it for purchase.
973,5,Easy install on my 00 Honda civic. May have to adjust shoes if they are a little worn or replace shoes which is little more of a project with some know how. Been using these for about a month and no signs of surface rust yet which is nice.
974,5,I wasn't expecting the product too take a month too get too me. But no big deal. It looked awesome on my Acura. I would recommend this product too anyone.
975,5,This was a great product and it worked as stated in the ad I am looking forward to using them in the future
976,5,"This part was exactly what I required, and even with shipping, and import fees, it was still way more inexpensive then the local wreckers!  It has been on for over a year and still looks brand new!"
977,3,"Lights itself was a perfect fit but the wiring did not match my 2005 wiring, the ends had to be changed to make the low beam lights work and the bulb in the driver side to the low beam blew out the next day after installation. I need to find out where I could purchase a new bulb"
978,5,Ordered the the one with white lettering for our red 2009 Challenger.  This will fit perfectly under the hood area behind  the front latching hook.
979,3,"This is more of a collectors toy to be put on the shelf and out of the way.  The front A-arms both snapped off within the first 24 hours of my step son playing with it.  Cool idea, just not really a toy that can be played with at all."
980,5,"Don't know why they didn't think of this when it was first manufactured. The original screen had several screws to remove.  It works like a charm, no screws, snaps right in. Thanks"
981,3,"I purchased this cooler as a 'bolt on' addition to the Flex-a-lite 67108 Radiator and Fan Package for Jeep Cherokee XJ 4.0. My XJ is a 1996 and I don't know if this has anything to do with the fitting issues I encountered. You will find a number of resources from Flex-a-lite to help in the installation of the radiator with references to this cooler. The YouTube video is NOT correct. It shows an assembly of the cooler that would not fit under the grill of my Cherokee.<br /><br />There are a number of issues that I encountered. First, the cooler will not fit in the suggested location, at least not if you plan on reinstalling the plastic grill. This is because the cooler sticks out an inch or more into the grill space. What I did is move the cooler to a more central location which bought me enough room to mostly clear the grill. Second, where the tabs hit the crossbar / radiator mount it pushes the cooler out about an extra inch at the mounting point. I fixed this by notching the crossbar and drilling new holes in the cooler mounting tab. With these modifications I was able to fit the cooler and the grill, after shaving about 1/4 of grill on the left side of the cooler.<br /><br />To be clear, by XJ is a 96 Sport with A/C. Others may have had different / easier installs but I thought I'd share to help you all be-aware.<br /><br />Lastly, you will need to cut the tubes from the transmission and put flares on the end to fit the hoses to the cooler. Do yourself a favor and get a double-flare kit that uses nuts to hold the pipe and create the flares. I started with a kit that used wing-nuts and that was an exercise in frustration. Being able to use a ratchet to tighten everything down makes the work much easier.<br /><br />I have not installed the Auto Meter 3849 temp gauge yet so I cannot report on the change in transmission temperature."
982,5,"The following products were ordered to pep up an old 1979 Chevrolet C-20 Single Cab Truck with a tired Small Block 305. I bought the old truck for $900.00 and it ran, but needed some fresh air. All of the products listed below were ordered from Amazon and installed recently. Everything listed not only fit perfectly, but also made an immediate and VERY Noticeable improvement in performance and Fuel mileage. Basically, my fuel efficiency increased by 40%.

I Highly recommend any and all of these products. Thanks to the manufacturers and Amazon for breathing new life into my Old Chevy…Five Stars for these products all the way!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
983,4,Other than that its OK. I worry more about if you can really drink water safely from it. The ends seem to be good. What I would really like to know is what material is it made from that makes it safe for drinking.
984,4,Happy with this product. Did what I needed to do with the exception of a little unfit issue but overall Happy.
985,5,these were a perfect fit for my 2009 650r ninja. I just wish they were a little brighter than they are
986,1,"Installed the cargo liner and was pretty sad to see how it fits. It is about 4 inches too short on the back side and too long in the front. Yes, it's installed correctly, pretty much no way to lay it in wrong. I called WeatherTech and was told Toyota instructed them how to design it this way. What? I have heard it all now."
987,5,This product was exactly as advertised. It works great. It took 30 seconds to install and worked great. I saved alot of money. I would recommend this to anyone.
988,1,"Cheap plastic which would not tightly fit.  Two of the covers came off while driving down the street at less than 20 mph.  Thank goodness I recovered them and reinstalled, thinking it was me. Twenty minutes later one of the remaining covers became a Frisbee also.  Recovered that and couldn't send them back fast enough.  Return was east, my only gripeis that it cost me $8 in shipping to return a defective item.  NOT FAIR"
989,4,Look at the picture the other buyer posted. If you have folding mirrors with LED's then I can tell you these fit.<br /><br />They aren't the greatest ever but they work and they fit.
990,5,"My Save-A-Step brace won't unscrew and extend, but I fixed that in the shop. It was too much paint (no problem). The amazing thing is that my wife can step out of the trailer without almost flipping the thing over. Me and the dog sleep better without being thrown to the floor everytime she steps out."
991,4,"Fits directly into the blanks on a Nissan Titan. Knocked off one star because the price is a little steep. Other than that, they're great."
992,5,"M-Y Wedge works just like they say.  It was a little long for my 40 hp Merc, but it can be trimmed to shorten the hight.  Would recommend to a friend."
993,5,"Perfect fit, had it installed in 1.5 hours. Best of all, the squealing noise is history. My dealer tried to tell me &#34;that's normal, they all sound like that&#34;. Sorry, no."
994,3,"I chose two BMW key-chains for my husband for Christmas.  He chose the other one, but I really like this one since it so so cute.  The tiny steering wheel clearly cannot hold many keys, so I keep it as the holder for our spare BMW key."
995,5,This fit my 2003 2500HD dash. I spray painted with SEM colorcoat to perfectly match my dash color and it looks great.
996,5,Great quality and customer service. Will order from seller again looks great on my window size is perfect and it's nice to show my support of my fur babies!!
997,5,"installed this water resistant rap on my k and n cone filter that's on the k and n cold air intake for my 98 ford ranger after I noticed water might be able to be splashed just under the right head light which is where the cone filter is. not sure how good the water resistance is, so I gave it 5 stars just to give it the benefit of the doubt. was easy to install, just slipped it over the cone filter without removing the cone filter from the intake, perfect fit."
998,1,The pack of 2 left me with one working and one that only the top leds worked.. The light is bright but the fact that one worked and one didn't left me with no choice but a 1 star.  Amazon said I could send them back for a refund but then I would have to climb a ladder on my RV to take the working one out and then box and ship them back.only to climb the ladder again when the replacements came to reinstall. Not very economic for me.. They couldnt just reship one bulb.  They  did refund 1/2 the cost but still leaves me short to buy just one as the price of 2 is just a bit more than one bulb..  I need the Led bulbs so will look elsewhere on Amazon.
999,4,"fit's & look's good on bar's but longer than expected, the other clamp's I have are short & will need to get one&#34;s that match the length."
1000,5,Great product great price would advise others to shop with this buyer. This was a must buy product and deal!
1001,5,"Great reception, fit without a single problem, looks so much better than the factory antenna.  Cheap easy improvement, highly recommended"
1002,5,I bought my first hids from kensun about  7 months ago and they are still working great. My brother also bought lights and his are still looking great after 6 months. I bought hids again for my fog lights and I had no problems with them. So that's four hid kits and zero problems.
1003,5,"Tried a few cheaper units with the non FTDI chip, and I never could get the drivers to load despite trying a lot of different methods.<br /><br />I plugged this cable in and the drivers installed automatically.  Works with KTM TuneEcu for flashing.<br /><br />Made the OBD to KTM adapter cable with instructions available online and plugged it into this."
1004,3,From a motorcycle perspective - sticky tape backing wasn't really sticky. The wires are VERY thin and it was difficult to attach them to other wires. I ended up not being able to use them at all.
1005,3,"I give the buy a 3 because the first one I recieved did not work straight out the box , but on that note it was promptly replaced by the date I asked and it works pretty good. The only problem I have with the gun so far is jamming,  I use stainless steel rivets with it so maybe that's why but if the rivet stud is bent or has to be forced in it almost always jams other than that its greatt , considering the price."
1006,5,"It works great with my Hyundai Sonata 2007. I like it. I recommand this product to everyone, x x x"
1007,5,"Love this top, the looks are awesome, better looking top than factory. Easy to install, just takes time. Make sure you set the top out in the sun all day before you try to install, too loosen up the fabric. Very tight fit"
1008,5,best  10.5 wires for the money works as good as msd or taylor wires no modifications needed worked out of the box.
1009,5,I loved how this look.  Will be happy to get our horse trailer done and be able to put these sticker that I bought on it.
1010,5,"Does what you need to have done, They really help.Does what you need to have done, They really help. A good product."
1011,4,"The pictures were a little dark for real clarity. PONTIAC left out some stuff I wish was there, but was pretty common AT THAT TIME, but would be helpful today."
1012,4,The replacement fuel cap works great.  I believe with a bit of ingenuity the company could figure out how to put a restriction cable to attach to the vehicle.  I do recommend this product.
1013,5,Ordered a tailgate mat whose instructions were to drill holes in my new truck to install. That wasn't happening. Used this to attach the mat and it did the job
1014,1,Light was bright but the quailty of the casing it was in was terrible. Paid alot of money for these to fall apart on me. Not sure if i would recommend buying these.
1015,2,I put it in myself works ok I guess go up good but I have to help it going down kinda pisses me off about this product but can't do anything about it now
1016,5,"Saw this referenced on another site and it really is good stuff.  My spa cover had been somewhat neglected for over a year and as soon as I cleaned it and applied Aerospace to it, it looked like new."
1017,5,"Worked our way through the 40,50,60,70 and are now in the 80's,with our collected car club. At our age one a little more comfort is required. We do like to show our cars with as much original and reprint literature as we can find,this was an excellent reprint."
1018,5,Bought one of these for each of our vehicles. Especially useful in one vehicle with a shattered deck. Cheaper than replacement. Especially love the SuedeMat material. Looks much prettier than the carpet ones.
1019,5,The bags arrived in good condition and fit great.  They actually work a little better than the hard side luggage because they give a little.  I've used both. I'm happy with the purchase and speed that Amazon sent them.
1020,5,Nice and bright little light. Will have to see how long the batteries last but so far so good. Ended up not needing he strap as it wedged right between my roll-bar spreader bars. Also has mounting holes on each end so can be screwed/bolted in if needed.
1021,5,Easy to fit<br />Looks great<br />Needed to drill a couple of holes to accommodate abs braking cables but no big deal<br />I love these products so much I have ordered some more for my bike
1022,4,Great looking and easy to put together. Only complaint Is the mounting screw/nut is kinda cheap looking. Overall great product though
1023,4,"It covered 99% of the parts that I needed, naturally the one it didn't was the one that I needed, from what I'm gathering that one cap/plug isn't included in any kits so... it's a good kit"
1024,3,"This item is not really a bad design. I just wish it was made of better plastic/rubber. its more plastic than rubber.<br />I was hoping to just sculp it to the floor so that when my kids (babies really), who sits in the back, eat their food, it would catch all the crumbs and liquids that they spill.<br />i got it on a good discount so it wasnt so bad. but i wouldnt pay retail on it..."
1025,1,"As soon as I put these in, they had a flicker to them.  I have 55watt digital ballasts with a relay.  The Ballasts are fine, because I had some bulbs in there for quite a long time before I put these in there.  I had some $8 bulbs in there which performed significantly better than these.  After having these in for 3 days, on of the bulbs got extremely dim and turned a yellowish color, then the next day it stopped working.  Shortly after, the other one would not ignite.  Not a good set of bulbs for the money, some cheaper than half of the cost of these outperform these.  Not satisfied."
1026,5,It works..  I like having all chargers for these items together so I do not have to keep looking for them.
1027,5,Took maybe five minutes to install and it looks great. As long as you follow directions for tightening the cap you'll be fine. Works like a champ.
1028,3,"Luckily I intended to only use the wheel and not the horn button, as I'm putting it in a boat. The grip and the brushed material in the center are decent quality for what you pay. The bezel that holds the horn button in place is cheaply made, and there were screws missing. The horn button itself is cheaply made, and the spade connectors that you'd wire to your horn are loose. None of the 6 mounting screws to attach the wheel to the hub matched one another. If you intend to wire the horn I don't think I'd recommend this."
1029,5,This chamois was just what we were looking for for our son on the dive team. When the chamois dries it becomes stiff as a board and once you throw it back in the pool becomes soft as a rag! Quickly dries him off as they wring it out and towel dry off over and over between dives. May need a few more for the vehicles in the spring!
1030,5,"WORKS GREAT SAVES TIME AND MONEY, NOT FOR THE TECHNICALY CHALLENGED EXPERIENCED TECHS ONLY NEED ATTEMPT TO USE. THANK YOU"
1031,5,The Raybestos Professional Grade Stabilizer Bar Bushings made a big improvement in the ride quality and stopped the rattling noise whenever we hit a bump. They fit my 2003 Dodge Caravan perfectly. Having the end links off to replace at the same time helped make it easier. I am hoping for longer life due to the upgrade in material. Installer's note -- The split line is at the six o'clock position viewed from the end instead of the 3 o'clock position like on the old rubber bushings from Chrysler. Put one on backward and couldn't get the bracket on until I figured this out. Also a little grease inside the bushing and on the stabilizer bar helps to slide them on and prevent squeaking. You may have to loosen the bolts to what looks like part of the transmission cooler to get the driver's side bracket off and on.
1032,1,"There is NO way the carrier is able to hold the size/amount of luggage claimed.  It is poorly made, the zipper broke on the first use!  If you want a durable roof top carrier, purchase the plastic ones that lock.  They hold more, protect your luggage and have no cheap plastic zippers that snap from normal usage."
1033,2,"Ive bought AVS visor kits for other trucks before, this time for my 06 Pilot.  The fit and finish on these are surprisingly poor.  Theres hardly any straight line where there should be, theyre uneven and curvy and almost all of the edges are rough with white slivers of plastic fringed around.  Once installed, from 25 feet they look fine, up close its a different matter.  If youre AR, Id stay away from this set.  I wish I could replace them with something else but theyre on now and not an easy thing to remove and replace"
1034,5,"This is the second one I bought, the first one was for the driver's side. You may have to file the area around the locking mechanism (on the new part) to allow the lock to work correctly. Once I did that it worked great."
1035,3,"Looked nice except that the chrome frame had discolored parts that looked like water spots.  I tried chrome/metal polish, but it didn't come off.  If buying in person, would never had bought the one with these discolored areas."
1036,5,Nice smelling and gives that blink blink finishing. most folks who sat my car claims that my car interior looks new
1037,5,"The installation was fairly simple. I replaced a Winnegard crank-up antenna with the Jack antenna. The only unexpected issue I ran into was that the Jack antenna required a larger roof opening than the crank-up did. I was able to quickly enlarge the opening with a 2&#34; hole saw. After that, installation was a breeze. The antenna works very well and brought in 5 more channels than my crank-up did. I found the SureLock feature to be a little inaccurate, but that may improve once I try it away from home. I especially appreciate how easily the antenna turns. I am slightly concerned the antenna may snag low lying tree branches, so I will have to be even more careful when driving near trees. The antenna is mounted right next to my satellite dome antenna, so I am also concerned that it may at some point interfere with my satellite reception, but time will tell. All said, the Jack Antenna is a great gadget and it works as advertized."
1038,2,"All parts in the kit works perfect and is just the parts you need for Subaru Outback 2005 2,5 lit engine (no turbo) exept for the water pump. Suburu has 4 different water pumps for different engines and this water pump in the kit was not the correct one."
1039,5,"Got this because my daughter is organizing a charity 2k &#34;Zombie Run&#34; as a fundraiser for her school.  She loves it, my son loves it, and their friends think it's awesome.  Look at that, I'm suddenly a cool mom....for a little while, anyway."
1040,5,GREAT COVERS EASY TO INSTALL FITS VERY WELL LOOKS GREAT WHEN INSTALLED WOULD DEFINITE;Y BUY FROM AGAIN<br />ONE OF MANY ZEBRA ITEMS IN HER FORD EDGE
1041,4,I had no problems with this item. It is obviously a &#34;budget&#34; item and the quality is what I expected for the price. I welded this piece on instead of using the slip fit.
1042,5,"this thing actually has 2 uses, you can easily check to see if your power outlet has power tit by plugging it in.. if the light comes on it has power.. if you need power and ground to check a circuit when you are in the cargo area of your suv or in the back of the mini van, plug it in to the outlet and the prongs on the end are you power and ground connections"
1043,5,I needed this machine so many time this winter I cannot remember how many times. I used it often. For real !!!!
1044,2,It dosnt stay plunge in it falls out of the lighter my phone never charges because of it I got robbed
1045,3,"Just received yesterday.  These run big.  I should've ordered the next size down.  I measured as described in description, &#34; L Calf (up to) 18&#34; High 20&#34;**** XL Calf (up to) 20&#34; High 20.5&#34;**** &#34;,  and ordered XLg for my 19.5in calf.  There is space between the leather and the liner I'm going to fill with neoprene foam to insulate more and take up the extra space."
1046,3,"Missing components, but reliability of MOOG Parts is owesome..I'm hoping they will send me a replacement piece. Also, the box had a sticker that stated need to re-box from the supplier."
1047,5,I LOVE THIS STICKER!!!!!!!! its east to put on and looks amazing this is awesome for all those jack skellington fans!!
1048,4,Works like the original switch except for the blue light that stays on for the window locks. This is not an oem replacement.
1049,3,"Solid piece of work and has worked for me well for more then 1 year now. Installation instructions have you believe you can install this within 90 minutes - far, far from the truth. Fishing the nuts in with the little wire is not possible in the bumper bar in the Infiniti FX35. The FX35 has a number of protrusions that do not permit all 4 bolts being installed.  I figured this out after a day struggling with the darn thing and finally taking a couple of pictures with my iPhone of the inside of the bumper bar.<br /><br />I ended up creating my own &#34;nut&#34; by sliding a piece of heavy stock metal that I pre tapped with the bolt thread."
1050,4,"Lights have been on truck for awhile now.  Took a 3000 mile trip thru the lousy winter weather. Even with all the sand/salt, the lights haven't discolored, cracked, etc.<br />Lenses still look good as new."
1051,5,"Very impressed with this tool. The tire gauge is accurate, and digital with lit display. The many side tools like the light, and window breaker, screw drivers and more that in any situation can and will come in handy. It is the perfect size and weight for storage! Overall, the ideal tool for your car."
1052,5,Bought to replace a bad coil on my MK3 Jetta. Old one left me stranded in a rainstorm. As of yet have not had any moisture issues with the new one.
1053,4,"I bought this hand-guards for a Can Am Outlander 800. The original hand-guards were very worn, therefore, they needed to be change out.<br /><br />This Renthal hand-guards were very easy to install, and are soft and grippy.<br /><br />Would recommend to anyone needing new hand-guards for their bike/ATV."
1054,4,very clean looking although i thought it would be alittle bit bigger but over all its a nice product and easy to install.
1055,4,"The part matches the previous handle that broke, but does not fit snug like our other handles. Nonetheless, it works and we are happy with it."
1056,5,"Got this for my fiance's si for Christmas, she loves it.  Thanks so much, inexpensive.. but perfect fit.  CHEERS TO YOU!"
1057,5,"Had a lot of problems with my tail-gate on my RX300. It does not open fast enough and then I have to lift it almost half way before the lift was picking up. Even then the door does not go all the way to the top. Many a times I hit my head as the door drooped down. Finally, frustrated I checked the dealer prices - two words Highway robbery. Then I came across these beauties. Was soooo easy to install. Took me about 20 minutes to replace. Working perfect. Great product for a great price."
1058,2,"I knew it was plastic when I ordered it and I wish now I had bought a metal one. This has only two holes at the top so the bottom flops around on the license plate. I had to use clear plastic tape to keep it in place and so the car wsh wouldn't rip it off.<br />Furthermore, the bottom edge of the frame blocks out the month and year stickers on my license plate which is not legal in Minnesota and probably most states."
1059,5,I did an internet search to view a video showing me how to install it so it was no problem. The only tricky thing was one of the original screws was a little tight--maybe no trouble for a strong guy but it took this gal a little work. Other than that it was fabulous and I'm very happy. This is the 2nd visor I needed replaced--the first was while it was still under warranty (the driver side). And this time the passenger and Hyundai (not under warranty now) said they would do the labor free but not the part and the part was going to cost $100. So I highly recommend buying it on Amazon and going it yourself. Less than half the price and took me less than 10 minutes. No wonder the labor was free as it might've only taken them 4 minutes to install.
1060,4,"I got these to protect my back seats of my truck. They work great. I didn't know how to thread the buckles, and it is a requirement. I experimented with several configurations, and I think I got the correct one. It is hard to buckle the upright seat if your arm/hands are large. My a normal size, so it was easier. I didn't have any instructions to tell me what to do with the loops at the sides of each bottom seat cover. I tried threading the strap with the buckle through them. It seems to hold them tight. I think they will do a great job of protecting the seats from the dirty/muddy passengers; they have the added benefit of making my seats a lighter color. I have black seats which are hot in the Houston summers.<br />I had the same brand with my previous truck, and it gave me years of services. I actually recycled them by selling them to a person to use on their truck. I believe they are working well for them, also."
1061,3,"Hi and yes it fits sort of at least from end to end but the rear tires are not covered,<br />And the cover is a lot thinner that I thought it would be and I'm doubtful it will last 3yrs,<br />So I should have ordered a thicker or stronger cover."
1062,5,Bought thus for my husband's truck to pull our camper and it works great. Also didn't take him long to put on his truck.
1063,5,Looks and works great.  Really protects the top rail from damage.  Adhesive tape is really sticky so use care when installing. They can be removed (with effort) in the event you have to realign but otherwise install easily. Would buy again.
1064,5,These bulbs work well. I replaced the cheap ones in my recently purchased 2005 Prius with two of these and save tons of money compared to what I would have paid at dealership.
1065,4,"I purchased this end link set for my '94 Honda Accord. I have yet to actually install the product, and will update review later when I have, but I just want to clarify for anyone else who is thinking about purchasing this that the picture shown of the red bushings is not what you get. This set is the correct set for the Accord and has the black greasable bushings and is much shorter in length. I know ES has a good reputation so I am sure this product will hold true to it."
1066,5,"I have had this mirror for several months now and I love it. It is exactly as the original. I cannot even tell! Delivery was very good, also."
1067,1,This looked great when received and was such a good price. I guess you get what you pay for. Rusted within weeks of use. Shame on me for not realizing that my husband had removed it from his car before the return window ended.
1068,5,"I installed these on the rear of my Dodge RAM SRW 3500 Truck and noticed the better stopping power IMMEDIATELY! after driving around with these for over a week, I liked these so much that I joined Amazon Prime (to save on the shipping) and ordered a set for the front of my truck."
1069,5,My camping trailer came with dual 5 lb. propane tanks and a soft cover.  When traveling the cover would twist around and bunch up.  I purchased this cover on Amazon and couldn't be happier.  It fit nicely over the tanks and offers easy access since it has a top panel that lifts up.  I secured it to the trailer with a couple of cable ties.
1070,2,I liked this product because my car always gave false low tire pressure alarms from different rotational speeds. But after not even 2 years the sensors no longer send signals. I wouldn't mind replacing them when I have my tires changed next time (sports car tires don't last long) but the replacement sensors cost way too much. So while the product was nice when it worked I would not recomend due to short life span of batteries.
1071,5,"I just finished breaking in the new Black Magic brake pads everyone's going on about over on the Jeep Wrangler forum.  The folks at blackmagicbrakes.com recommend the Centric rotors and now I know why.  After break-in, this combo works and works well.<br /><br />The rotors are well made and plated (not painted) on the non-friction surfaces to resist corrosion. I got 0.001 runout on both front rotors mounted.  Not bad at all."
1072,5,"A lot more than you will ever need. Plus, they have almost all sizes of fuses. Not much more to ask for."
1073,5,"Perfect fit for my 2002 Civic and looks nice.  It was very easy to install it and we did not paint it at all, as of now it has not faded at all."
1074,5,This is really a good meter to test for hot stuff. I have used it in my line of work to test for STDs and STIs. You just put one in in the mouth and the other in the yoohoo and if the screen shows 666 then you are in trouble!
1075,5,I bought these for my fiance for his 2013 Sonata.  They are a good material and have worked great with all the snow we have had.
1076,5,"Arrived quickly, easy to install.  The harness was not exactly the same - old lights/wiring fit into the new unit, but the reverse was not true, so had to use the old wiring with the new light.  Saved over 300 dollars buying from you and installing myself!"
1077,5,they look good and stayed intact thru a snow storm and was a great price. would purchase again.. thank you
1078,4,"It is a cobra. Well known name in trucking. Great to mount and keep out of the way. Can be turned of to avoid draining the battery. Great all round, just little expensive. But you are getting a Cobra."
1079,4,Love this stuff! I have used it on my vehicles and it showed! I also sell tool boxes for a living and it makes a great cleaner/wax for them as well! It's nice to have one bottle in the garage that can clean and wax all kinds of surfaces! I highly recommend it. But remember it only works if you actually use it ;-)
1080,5,Great belt. Put it on before all this snow and works perfect. No noise and runs smooth. I recommend it.
1081,5,"Love this scarf i bought this for burning man, 2013 the dust was minimal so this offered plenty of protection for me. I would wear this any time anyways I'm kind of a freak lol"
1082,4,"Nice design if you like fish!  I bought this for a friend, who loved it.  The fit is good on a Ford SUV and they really look good."
1083,5,"I purchase this and installed myself.  It did take a minute to figure out how to put this thing inside the vent. At one time, I thought it was too small but, I finally figured it out.  It works as expected and I did not have to pay a dealer some crazy labor costs..As a woman, that is a beautiful thing to understand how to fix my BMW."
1084,5,"In the past my frugal method of chain lubing demanded the help of a friend: he would pull my Suzuki SV1000S over onto the kickstand via the handlebar and hold it there, balanced, allowing me to turn the rear wheel and advance the chain as I sprayed on the chain lubricant.  It worked, but what about when I didn't have another capable person around?  The Wheel Jockey (WJ) allows me to lubricate the motorcycle chain without any other helps or equipment, on my own.  That's what I bought if for, that's what it claims to do, and it does it very well.<br />The WJ is durable, compact and completely portable.  It fits comfortably in my tailbag so I can take it on long multi-day rides and keep my chain well lubricated.  I've had it for several years now and consider it a key piece of maintenance equipment."
1085,5,"When I received this kit today I attempted to read the enclosed instruction booklet... WHAT A JOKE! The print is way too small and confusing... take this install book and throw it away along with the mounting brackets for the ballast. Luckily I was a mechanic for years and had some idea of simple plug and play components. If you have never changed a headlamp bulb on a Porsche Boxster the entire headlamp capsule must be removed... this is easy, there is a rubber plug to remove in the Frunk simply use a 5.5 mm socket and rotate the top of the socket towards the front of the car and the headlight pops right out. Remove the cover from the back of the assembly and you will see all the wiring and the bulbs. Remove the bulb that sticks out further (this is the low beam). Remove the retaining clip as this will have to be placed over the wire. Install the bulb, and route the clip over the wire and secure the bulb. Now plug the 2 pronged socket that was on the original bulb onto the new harness, plug the remainder of the wires together (it is obvious). Put the cover back on and slide back the headlamp assembly (everything will line up) turn the socket retainer back to the original position... you are done. It took me a total of 20 minutes (including finding the right tools) to do the whole project (15 minutes for the first one and 5 for the second). The lights work as described and has EVERYTHING you need (minus the  tools and maybe a beer)."
1086,5,"This product is by far the best I have ever used. Ur helps to neutralize odious and leaves behind a very nice pure citrus scent..as if I just zested an Orange. Yes its more expensive than chemical air freshners that are loaded with toxins and artifical fragrences because this is made purely from citrus oils. There is no chemical additives therefore it does cost more. If you sont care about breathing in toxins, apend less for glade or febreze but if you want an odore iliminator or nice freshener that won't kill you, this ones it!"
1087,5,"There isn't much to say.  It's a dorman control arm, at a good price.  I could have paid more to have it same day locally, but didn't need it that quick."
1088,1,"The light looks awesome, however the first time on the road with cold weather and the entire lense had cracked.  It is a flat glass lense that is thin and will break easily.  There was no mark like a pebble hit it, it was just cracked all the way across.  I called the customer service to see if I could get it fixed or repaired, and was told to buy a new headlight.  Nothing they could do for me.  This was an expensive headlight and I only got to use it one time.  Very disappointing.  Had to throw the entire thing away and find another headlight to use.<br /><br />Horrible product!!  Do not buy!!  Especially with a glass lense that is thin and fragile!!"
1089,5,I love this decal. I think I've purchased it for a couple of subaru's I've had. I have the best photo of my dog sticking his head out the window in the background with the decal on my mirror. It's awesome!
1090,5,Don't let the dealer sell you an OEM cabin air filter for 2 or 3 times the price of one of these.  They are very easy to replace and work just as well.
1091,5,Bought these along with new rotors to put on my car.<br />These brake pads so far are performing very well.<br />They are quiet and there is very low dust.
1092,4,Not as bright as I thought they would be and they need covers so they don't light up the inside of the car
1093,3,"vinyl top looks like decent quality but does not fit my mule properly.  The angles of the corners do not line up with the crossbars.  The velcro provided appears to be something you stick on with adhesive, so don't do that unless you can tell the fit is perfect. Also, no instructions provided.  After contacting the seller with these issues, the return was authorized and paid for which was timely and friendly,"
1094,5,These are inexpensive replacements for the OEM equipment.  They are a little on the fragile side but work well.  I use them because I do a fair amount of off road and snow plowing and in both instances I have destroyed side mirrors.
1095,5,Fast delivery. Perfect fit. Looks good. Reduces wind noise with the window slightly open. Installing was so easy a cave man could do it.
1096,5,"Seems to work well installed on my 1984 Nissan 720.  After I put a volt meter on each lead to determine what was what, I wired it up.  Afterward, I had some wiring repair to do on the trailer itself, but the Converter seems to be working just fine after about a year in all kinds of extreme conditions.  No problems at all."
1097,5,"This one of those purchases I made for me and the wife as we were about to take a road trip - I'd seen a short news segment on a similar item a while back and when I ran across it here while looking up something else thought &#34;eh, why not?&#34; The price was great and it lends a little peace of mind in my travels. Again, Better to Have and NOT need than to NEED and not HAVE."
1098,4,Not great  but good  don't over pay for then be sure to get the right size and go Bucs 2003 champs
1099,5,"I got this because I thought I needed a lot of grease. I probably didn't need this much but it will last a long time and its good, high pressure automotive grease. I use it for the drive shaft and all the grease points on my work van and all of my other cars and grease needs. Not for boat trailer bearings."
1100,1,I bought this as a Christmas present for my girlfriend. She drives an 04 Olds Alero and they ripped as I was trying to put them on. The purple fabric tore apart as I was trying to get them on. The bands to secure them started to rip and they just looked awkward and ghetto after they were on. Don't waste your money.
1101,4,"Our Jeep always sits outside. The original top leaked and lasted about four years before the sticthing disintegrated. This is the third PE replacemnt top we have put on it. The material is not as heavy, but they have lasted almost as long. The one before this did not fit as well, but it never leaked. This one fits much better and also doesn't leak. Compared to OEM tops, this one is almost free and works just as well, if not better. The only concern is that we are going on eight weeks and the rebate hasin't turned up yet. We'll see."
1102,5,Bought to replace headlight for father's golf cart. This was an excellent buy - very happy with price and delivery.
1103,5,"An excellent and easy way to order Genuine Hyundai accessories on Amazon from Hyundai. Great price, fast shipping and a perfect fit. We also got floor mats, a cargo net and a spare tire kit. And, if you are in the market for a new car, we got the fully loaded top model-- the Elantra Limited, with the tech package, GPS, etc. Excellent price, 0.0% financing (for qualified buyers), and we think an unbeatable warranty.<br /><br />We knew going in that this car didn't come with a spare tire (although it has a storage compartment for one), and while that seemed a little odd, the overall deal (and beautiful car in Sparkling Ruby exterior and Tan interior) was too good to pass up. I was  quite unsure of buying a Hyundai, but they now have three very happy new customers in our family that will be back to buy again when the time comes. We already got an Elantra for our daughter too. We will look to add either a Sonata or Santa Fe in a few years. Who knew?"
1104,5,"I am a shortie so the seat belt cuts right into my neck.  with the shoulder pad, it is soft and comfortable.  No more pain.  So glad I brought them."
1105,3,"definately a 5 out of 10 . should have done more for the hype and price!,.?%#@&*^$ next time i will read reviews first !"
1106,3,Product did not seem new as it left a minor streaks on my windshield Other than the product was fine
1107,5,"The Big Easy is a great item.  It really is big, so storage between uses is an issue.  This pouch solves the problem."
1108,1,"I mostly wanted a small knife for cleaning under my fingernails.  This knife blade is only sharpened on one side and is flat, and is a horrible tool for cleaning under my fingernails.  The knife is dull, and attempts to sharpen it are futile<br /><br />The Light is extremely dim.  Mostly a Joke, and pretty blue too<br /><br />The thing is so much bigger than any car key I've ever seen, so there goes the stealth factor.  Anybody who sees this will know this thing is not just a Key, but some hideous impulse buy anybody with a brain will regret.<br /><br />In fact this thing is so worthless for anything but taking up more room in my pocket, I think I am going to smash it with a hammer right now.<br /><br />Waste of 5$.  I very much regret this purchase."
1109,4,"Updated Review:  Well, less than a month after Christmas, this wallet has ripped and my son is no longer using it.  He is really bummed because he loves the logo, but when I asked him if he wanted me to get it replaced, he said \\""no, it will just happen again, I can tell.  It's not sturdy enough for removing cards and putting them back in\\"".  So now I guess I'll try to get refund or credit on this item.<br /><br />Original Review: The wallet was really beautiful and well made. My son loved it. My only complaint was it didn't hold as much as I thought it would hold."
1110,5,"We have used this twice (once from VA to FL, and once from VA to the beach) and it worked great. Half of our trip to Florida was in the rain, and nothing got wet in the bag. Happy with this purchase."
1111,1,"All the paint has chipped off. The Ford logo is gone, all that's left is a white oval. Made of cheap plastic."
1112,5,"Good Quality Filter at a Good Price.  This filter comes in retail packaging, just like you see at the automotive stores."
1113,4,"Purchased this item for my boss as a Christmas gift.  He really liked it and it looks fabulous on his old truck (which did not have a tailgate).  Would have given this 5 stars, but felt the shipping charges were a little high."
1114,5,"Very good quality filter because of the materials used, O-rings and rubber seals for my BMW-M6 500hp V10 engine. This product<br />will last up to 15k."
1115,5,"I just do oil changes in my garage at home, but i must say that i will never need another drain pan again. This thing makes sure you spill absolutely no oil at anytime, plus its big enough that you can empty the oil filter and the pan at the same time.<br /><br />i can transport the used oil easily without the pan buckling and spilling the oil, becuase the plastic is very heavy gauge."
1116,4,I do like the wheel it is stiffer than the one it replaces but still has a little bit of flex which is kind of why 4 rather than 5. But it looks nice and with it being a bit of a deeper wheel helps bring with wheel closer in the race car with the seats mounted further back than stock.
1117,5,"i love it! at first it felt weird, almost like rope, but once it was broken in it was great!"
1118,4,"The item is smaller than it appears on the jeep picture.  With that said, it held much more than I imagined and will work well for the purpose I purchased it for.  I need a easy to carry first aid kit for coaching.  The whole &#34;back pack&#34; straps & straps of the back used to secure it to a jeep is actually a large velcro piece enabling one to remove the kit from the jeep leaving the &#34;back pack&#34; straps on the jeep bar.  I just pulled off those straps since there is another handle for carrying."
1119,4,Love the decals.  Plan to spice up my car this spring so feel fun.. Can also use them on other items.
1120,5,"Purchased for a Scion tC 2006.  Super-easy install.  Save yourself $20, and not buy it at the Toyota service center."
1121,5,Got a used Toyota Sienna with only one key and I knew that wouldn't work.  Bought two of these and had them cut and programmed and they work as well as the original!  Feel much more comfortable knowing I have a spare.
1122,3,"Decent wipers, not a perfect fit on the passenger side, also they deposit spray on the windshield with every return to battery if you're driving more than 25 mph."
1123,5,"If you are on the road for a living, camping or a trip for pleasure this cooker is a must. You can have a wonderful meal for a fraction of a fast food, truck stop meal."
1124,5,It's a small sturdy tool that does the job it is supposed to.  Arrived in good condition and appears that it will last for many years.
1125,4,"I can get this for $4 or $5 at my local Autozone.  Road salt always eats up my muffler and exhaust, and I've had very good results using this stuff, even covering up some pretty big holes.  Fit your first piece around the muffler so that you have a few inches overlap; cut your remaining pieces from this first piece.  The instructions tell you to dip the bandages in the liquid... this will NEVER happen (too thick).  I get a big piece of cardboard, lay the bandages down one at a time just before I'm ready to put each on, and paint the liquid on both sides.  You don't need a ton, just enough to get the bandage thoroughly wet.  When I do it like this, I usually have extra liquid activator left over.  I try to have at least 3-4 layers over the holes before I'm done.  Cut the ends off the tube, and you have a nice metal patch to lay down over big holes before you begin bandaging.  I let the engine run to get the exhaust really hot, then let the car sit overnight to let the bandages harden.  Repair jobs usually last around 6 months; I've had some last longer, but anything over 6 months I consider bonus time.  I've never failed emissions inspection using these kits.  Depending on how holey my muffler is, sometimes I've needed two kits, but $5-$10 for six months of a quiet muffler and avoiding hundreds in mechanic bills?  Sign me up!"
1126,4,"awesome item for my LEXUS is 350 headlights, I would recommend this product to lexus owners that don't want to over pay for their headlights!! DO IT your self saves a lot on these headlights!"
1127,4,Good quality and funny for KIA owners. I keep mine in the backseat with the seatbelt on. good quality stuffed animal
1128,5,No prblems what so ever great fit and made the oe tailights look cheap in comparison. Be a littlw careful on potential over tighten the tye screws.
1129,4,"Sturdy, good quality scrapper and snowbrush. It's the perfect size for a small car. Only complaint I have is the scrapper hits my side mirrors while I'm scrapping the side windows and won't allow me to get all the way into the lower corner of the window. But overall, I'm happy with the product."
1130,3,"Everything about these goggles are wonderful with one exception. The foam border that makes contact with the face is very, very, cheap. Putting a decent quality material that makes contact with the face here would put these goggles over the top! Other than that very, very nice product. I would still recommend these and purchase them again. Just hoping the manufacturer will take a hint and upgrade the foam. I am not the first one to mention this."
1131,3,The tool bent up too quickly I thought it would last for quite a few jobs but it only lasted for 2 jobs.
1132,5,We ordered the cross bars for our 2012 Journey so that we could attach our Sears X-Cargo Sport cargo carrier to the vehicle. I did not have any difficulty with installation but it is important to read the directions and follow the instructions IN ORDER. Be sure to tighten the rear hex screws BEFORE tightening the front screw.
1133,4,"Ordered and received this light bar quickly with the outstanding Amazon Prime. Fit was perfect, just removed 4 bolts put in place and tighten the bolts. Awesome quality and durability for the price. Powder coated with great welds on all tabs. VERY strong, I stood on it once installed and almost no flexing. I chose to run my wires thru the tube for a &#34;clean&#34; install, which required drilling. All in all you can't beat the quality and price with ease of installation."
1134,2,It clearly states these lights wont give you an error message but they do.  So either I need to spend more money on a relay or return them.
1135,5,Makes trailering my motorcycle a MILLION times easier and safer!! These are a must! They are super durable and definitely quality<br /><br />I would highly recommend
1136,5,"This was easy to install, and seems to be very solid.  I installed it on an older Xplorer 400 with a Warn plow."
1137,5,Fit perfectly and loved that it wasn't so heavy I can take it out and shake it when needed. Great product!
1138,5,I've been pleased with this clothing bar.  It's solid (not flimsy); it adapts well to the two very different vehicles that we've used it in; and I get the impression that it's going to last a very long time.  I'm very pleased with this purchase.
1139,3,"These seat covers look &#34;ok&#34; once installed, but installing can be quite a pain. The two front seat covers didn't quite fit correctly and the elastic around the sides actually ripped a little when trying to pull them over the seats. I was very careful and went slowly, but they still ripped a little. Not the actual leather, but the cloth material on the sides. I've only had them in my Maxda CX-7 for a month, so I can't really comment on their extended durability... but so far they are holding up nicely for a family of 3.<br /><br />I would give more stars if the seat covers fit better. But you get what you pay for I suppose."
1140,1,The covers were flimsy & they ripped within one week of being on the seats! I wasted my money!  I bought other Betty Boop covers they never ripped were a much better quality & cost less!
1141,3,I tried various levels of inflation and was never ever to find one that made the cushion more comfortable than my standard seat.  I purchased the unit to improve comfort for long distance riding and it did not accomplish thst
1142,5,I've used products like this before from 5 star shine and Zaino Bros. both worked good but I decided to give this a try.  I'm really happy with the finish and how slick my car is.  I put a plastic bottle of cleaner on my sun roof and it slipped right off.  Now I'm scared to put my coffee up there while I'm loading the car! I bought the Wet mirror finish as well.  It's a little harder to work with and I really couldn't tell the difference in the shine at all.  Maybe it's better on a dark car I have a white pearl.
1143,5,Arrived fast. The passenger side from another seller didn't work therefore had to send this one back. I was bummed as this would have put the finishing touch on my fj
1144,1,"I did NOT need this &#34;aligment kit&#34; after replacing the front struts on my 02 town and country took it to the aligment shop and asked them if they would nedd them and they said NO, the van was aligned with original camber bolts. it has been almost 2 years since that and has never came out of aligment"
1145,5,I can feel some better potency. I like this product and I will be continue to use this spark plug for my M109R
1146,4,"This does the job, plugged it in to my car and it reads out the odb ii information. Shows that I have to change my rear O2 sensor and oh how I can't wait to get that job started :(  It comes with a book to tell you about the codes and a little cdrom which I have no idea what that does I didn't use it. I just look up the codes online."
1147,5,This is the only oil filter I've used for my '07 TSX.  I change my oil twice a year (this filter + M1 0W30 AFE).  12k/yr.  Never any problems.  The surface is a bit smooth but use a good pair of grip gloves or bare hands and you should be okay.
1148,5,Really like this product!  Installed very easily and worked exactly as advertised.  I bought the &#34;large&#34; kit and it fit our awning perfectly.  Would highly recommend.
1149,5,"Durable, easy to install, and look great. Take seconds to install. Covers up the entire floor board and up the side where carpet usually gets stained by muddy boots. Great product."
1150,4,"good product--match was NOT exact, I did not contact seller as I was concerned more with preventing rust & the color was close enough for me. I know the seller said if the color match was not good they would re-mix if you are more concerned with color match than I am."
1151,5,"I really like this chrome grille, it really make my car look good, before it was just plain now it the bomb."
1152,4,Seems to work ok. Will no as I use the product. Will probably order more when I need them.<br />expensive to get to ship to me though.
1153,1,piss poor manufacturing no quality control order two different ones and both had same defect ordered Curt brand fit perfect
1154,5,These are a must have for any truck. They are custom to a supercab f250 and they protect the floor. They look good and they keep your factory floors looking like new. I just bought my truck and this is the first thing that I bought for a reason
1155,5,"QUALITY.  Make sure this fits!  This is the second tank that AMAZON recommended that DOES NOT FIT.  Great looking workmanship in manufacturing.  I have bought other tanks from Spectra-Premium and they have been great.<br /><br />This is going back, a second time."
1156,5,I bought these for my daughters VW Jetta because her existing lights had broken adjusters and had poor night vision. I was concerned that I might buy replacements that did not work as well as OEM lights. The lights were an exact fit of the original and I was able to adjust them properly and the light pattern provides good night vision. as an added bonus they make the car look better.
1157,5,"Great charger for the boat.  With the cost of deep cycle batteries, it pays to take care of them.  Amazon has the best price for this charger that I could find on the net.  Have had this charger for a 4 to 5 months now and it has worked great.  It has been on the batteries 24/7 with no problem."
1158,5,"This was $55 cheaper than Drag Specialties, $95 cheaper than Harley Davidson. It works great. If you need a Hitachi type starter go for it."
1159,5,Snug fit to the wheel and very soft to grip. Doesn't slip when turning.... waiting to see how long the designs shall last.
1160,1,I installed the batteries and they held a charge for one or two rides and then didn't. I have replaced the same batteries before and they have worked like new.
1161,5,"they fit great , and were easy to install, changed the whole looks of the truck, would recommend these to anyone"
1162,5,I was a little concerned because of 2 things. First on amazon it says it won't fit my Honda 2013 civic LX even though in the product description says it will. Second after reading all the comments I was afraid it definitely wouldn't fit because it was going to be smaller. I ordered it anyways hoping for the best.<br />I have had it for about 2 months and its just perfect! It fitted perfectly! It wasn't small at all and the material seems to be really resistant!
1163,4,I had a chance to use it before it got too cold and it performs pretty well.  It works better with a smaller buffer than the larger 10&#34; model so keep it around the 5-7&#34; rotating buffers and you'll like it too.
1164,4,"The helmet looks good and fits like I expected. The visor should be easier to open with one hand. It seems like a very good deal for the money, but I do not plan on trying it out to test the durability. Overall, I am pleased with the purchase."
1165,2,"Sent these back as they vibrate so bad you can't see anything! They do look nice when the vehicle is parked, and serve a purpose -- while you're parked! I'd avoid these and look for OEM mirrors or the pre 03 style that were solid."
1166,5,"I had some scratches on the top of the bumper, this covered them perfectly.  I can also now place items on the bumper before loading if necessary.  The Prius is used as a delivery car for a small company and sees a lot of abuse.  Its holding up well, better than the OEM ones look also.<br /><br />Oh and it is a little overpriced, its just plastic,  FYI"
1167,4,"Arizona is an interesting state. Grand Canyon and more. The keyring is well designed, sturdy and is only one of its kind to show the Amazing Arizona flag as it intended. Some Arizona flag product show a yellow star, not a copper one as official intent. The others could have used a brown tint to their design."
1168,5,It fulfilled the purpose I needed it for. It was easy to install and the length was more than adequate.
1169,5,"Easy to install, works good, hot water on electricity. Installed it at the campground while I was camping. Very good product."
1170,3,"Cheap, but not top quality. It still looks okay though but can see air bubbles however.  I'm glad I bought it though. I suggest getting it in black so you can't see the air bubbles."
1171,5,"As per their guidance, this was the exact color for my Honda's year/model.  Nicely covered all of paint chips just fine."
1172,5,I was skeptical about this but K-seal worked like magic in about 10 minutes.  I had a drip that was stopped and this saved me hundreds.  I'm very impressed and would recommend this to anyone with a minor coolant leak.
1173,3,"The unit does not have a \\""cancel\\"" switch. My install was in a manual transmission  2013 Versa. There is a reason that OEM cruise have a cancel, mainly so you don't have to touch the brake pedal to disengage.  The install instructions are generic (i.e. cover many models from the vendor), and yes I figured them out, but they should come with vehicle specific instructions on dismantling the plastic dash components. The control switch (wand) assembly CAN NOT be installed per the instructions, as this vehicle has a tilt steering wheel, and the locking lever would interfere withe the switch wand per the instructions. I moved this to be at the 10oclock position (top clam shell steering wheel bezel housing). Interface to the accelerator pedal harness uses a \\""T\\"" cable, which made this simple. The clutch and brake required splicing into the existing wiring. As well the power wire (near the ignition switch).    As the vehicle is manual transmission, there is no annoyance with the cruise trying to maintain speed by too much gain as I've seen in OEM systems (i.e. downshifting and overspeeding the engine RPM to capture speed). So I can't comment on how this would work with the Versa automatic or CVT transmissions.  I've had this now for 3 months, and I'm happy other then not having a cancel switch.  The power on LED could be brighter, as in indirect sunlight it's not viewable if it's on.  The coast and accelerate buttons have a few second delay before they operate. As well coasting then pressing the accelerate/engage does not capture the desired speed, i.e. it's always to slow to capture the desired operating point.  I would purchase again.  edited 3-4-2014 to clarify  edited 10-15-2014, I thought you had to depress the accelerator pedal to engage the unit, this is not true, but you have to be operating greater then ~35MPH for engagement.I would purchase again.<br />edited 3-4-2014 to clarify"
1174,5,I love my sparkly new frame!!! There were no stones missing as in other reviews I've read and it's really pretty and perfect for my Honda Civic DX!! I recommend this product :)
1175,5,"Ramps are exactly as described. work great. Easy to set up and use. They stay very secure while loading, as long as the safety straps are used as instructed, which is an absolute must for any atv loading ramps."
1176,1,"These wipers do not fit 2007 Chevy Silverado, although amazon does state that these do.  I was not able to return due to length of time before being able to attempt to put these on my truck.  Bad purchase."
1177,5,This is one of those perfect solutions.  Plug it in and power all your devices. No issues..I've been using this devices for years.  Don't change a thing!!!
1178,5,Awesome product they got it to me in no time very happy with Amazon.com I will recommend them to my friends
1179,2,"I liked everything about them except for fit , front covers were fine but did not fit back seats.  I have a vw 2013 ... and they did say fit vws but guess they didnt mean this years"
1180,5,Now my cellphone looks very well. And is so comfortable. I think I'm going to buy more that this products
1181,2,Did not hold a charge...dissatisfied will buy a different one at a lower cost also....the new one was much better...
1182,5,"I have received many stone chips because I did not have mudflaps. These did the trick. Perfect fit, and they are stylish."
1183,5,Exactly what I needed.  Something to protect the very expensive and fragile key that is always getting dropped on the ground.
1184,4,"The item is good, good quality and the price is right.<br />The one that I was looking for<br />Thank you"
1185,5,"I got these for my Partners new BMW he loves them great styling, great quality, and comfortable. Adding these looks great on your seat belt strap as well."
1186,5,It was fairly easy to install! Great plug and go option... This fit my new 2013 Malibu perfectly. Great item!
1187,4,"Super fast postage... about 1 week international to Australia.... Very impressed! The Weather shields were a perfect fit and the black slim style looks great. I installed these on a 98 Holden Jackaroo and they are a perfect fit. They don't only fit the Acura, Isuzu Bighorn, Trooper etc but I think they would fir all of the GM equivalents. The slim style seems to hold out the water from above, but I'm yet to test in heavy rain. They are mainly good for leaving the windows down an inch to cool down the car and if it happens to rain then its no worries."
1188,4,This one came with the splash guards and the axle nut. Good clean assembly. I purchased one at the local O'Reilly's and the boot started leaking grease in only a few months. It was a rebuilt model for about the same price.
1189,1,This is not worth the money.  It comes undersized and little to almost NO padding.  Uncomfortable and gets blown back too easily.  Doesn't fit 'low profile' either.
1190,5,Ordered a set of the 6000k and I must say they r bright sturdy and easy to install. ..I have them on my tractor which I run at night. Let me tell u these lights are amazing. I also ordered a set for my personal car which I will be installing soon..two thumbs up ....a must have if u r looking for a good pair of hid lights. ....kensun is the way to go ...
1191,3,The mats were new and fit just fine but they had an extremely strong odor of rubbing alcohol!  I tried airing them out on my patio but the odor persisted.  I tried hosing them down but the odor was still strong.  Finally I soaked them in a bathtub with laundry detergent and then rinsed them with the hose.  Now they've just got a slight alcohol odor.
1192,3,"Screws were a little too short for my cars frame holder, our mechanic friend fixed it. The fasteners are quite showy."
1193,5,"Fit perfectly in my 2008 Camry.  One of the originals was leaking after 75,000 miles so replaced them all.  Don't know about durability yet, but the ride is firm and solid again."
1194,5,Fit perfectly with exception of window bolt holes that were too small for rubber gasket. Install video on you tube
1195,3,Keeping it as a spare because the last one broke in half. Super glue is still holding so will not put it on until that goes.
1196,5,"Works great on E46 M3 2004. Saved 50% by avoiding BMW one. It's OEM but don't have to pay the price tag of a BMW labeled item. I got the engine light, after replacing with this item, resetting ECU, waited for few weeks, my car passed inspection."
1197,5,"I was so frustrated by the OEM key fobs.  Two are provided with your new vehicle.  They seem to last about 2 years, so I eventually used them both up.  new batteries do not fix them when they die.  I cleaned the contacts in one and that restored its functions for about 2 months, then nothing.  Those little paper thin contacts just plain wear out.  I asked the dealer what it would cost to get a replacement and was shocked at the quote.  $120 for the key fob and $30 to program it (labor time) so I am looking at $150 to get a new remote keyless from the dealer!?  Ridiculous!  But relying on the key to open the door is dangerous..what if it freezes or breaks?  (HHR owners realize there is *one* lock to open this car - if you get locked out of that you are SOL.)  When I decided to investigate after-market remote keyless entry systems online, I found this.  Excellent, perfect, works like a charm, wish I'd bought two!  Only complaint I have is the dealer nudging their programming charge up from $30 to $45.  They seemed peeved...well...now they know how it feels, I guess.  Still saved a ton of money doing it this way.  Highly recommended."
1198,5,Easy to instal and thick rubber....they look like the original OEM materials....there is not much more I can say about them.
1199,5,"Very sharp looking, well made and best of all US made. Will definitely need to pick up at least one more"
1200,4,"I bought this to replace my cabin air filter on my 2005 Honda Odyssey. It fits very well. The pleats were also not crushed.<br /><br />It might be a millimeter too short. I had to pull slightly to make sure the pleat on both ends sit in the plastic flange on the box carrier. Other than that, there was no issues in installing it. It took me longer to empty all the garbage in the glove box than to replace the filter."
1201,5,Product as described and works great. Also a great price as it is not much more than OEM price. Will reorder in the future.
1202,5,"Installing wheel detailing tape is not for the faint of heart. It requires time and patience so I recommend getting a good nights sleep and performing the install first thing in the morning when you are fresh. Per the instructions, place the tape into the included applicator and slowly spin the wheel while applying the tape. While applying use your finger to smooth out any air pockets or places it did not adhere to the wheel. Once applied all the way around the wheel cut the end of the tape, align it up with the tape already applied and smooth it on the wheel with your finger. Now spin the wheel and look for any uneven spots. Please be aware you have a limited amount of wheel detailing tape so if you pull the tape off in frustration or pull it off then reapply it more than once you will most likely have to purchase another kit. Don't get frustrated if it is not perfect! Will anyone notice when the bike is cruising at 50 miles and hour?"
1203,3,I plan to use this on my 67 Camaro to reduce the amp draw on the lighting switch and get brighter head lights. Have not used it yet but wanted to say the quality is very good. Just check all the pins on the relay sockets because I found one that had not been snapped in place. Not a fan of the plastic conduit so I plan to add wire loom. If it works as good as it looks I will give it a five star later. You can not buy the parts for this price and it would take 3 hours to make one!<br /><br />Edit:<br />Well I installed it. What I found was a well made high quality harness. The bad news is the wire looks like the correct gauge for the amp draw for headlights but when you strip it to shorten a wire you find a thick insulation with very few copper conductors. The wire is not what I would expect on a high current application.<br /><br />The parts could not be purchased separately for the $ so if you rewire it with the proper wire size on the current circuits ( lights) the wire size on the relay coils will be fine.<br />I reduced my review from a 4 star to a 3 star.<br />I would not recommend this to anyone who needs high current draw who could not modify it first.
1204,5,The cover is waterproof and has two hooks at the bottom to fasten them across the bottom side of the motorcycle. So far so good.
1205,4,This jacket is awesome.  The only cons are I wish it had more reflective material (only two thin strands on back) and when you take out the hoodie the material makes you sweat more and is uncomfortable on the skin.
1206,5,These wiper blades are the best that I have found for my motorhome.saddle mount perfectly.  I would these for anyone needing new wiper blades for their motorhome.
1207,5,"As stated it is white lithium grease. It works well for most anything requiring  lubrication. Too many house hold and automobile uses to go into, here.  See Permatex for further uses."
1208,5,Worked like a charm!  No problems at all.  Used it to reinstall rear bumper fuchsia onto my BMW were I had just installed a trailer hitch.  Good Quality tool that is made very well.
1209,1,The picture on the Amazon site is nothing like what we received ! This is a true ripoff that I am surprised Amazon didn't catch.
1210,4,"The helmet is functional, and fits well. Its not the most well made product out there, and I've looked up the item online And it is impossible to find replacement visor.I think its more worth 3.5 stars, but they don't have a half rating, and the price I paid at the time validates a higher rating than 3."
1211,5,"Excellent product.  Easy  to install and looks great too.  Will order the sunroof guard next and it Shipped very fast, too."
1212,5,This was exactly what I was looking for! It fit my vehicle perfectly.  It also worked great with the bike carrier that I used.
1213,5,"Installation was literally a snap, the connections fit just like advertised, only hassle actually hiding the wires. Saved at least an hour of time.  I recommend to anyone adding a trailer hitch to their car."
1214,5,"The battery works perfectly. Batteries like this do not maintain a charge over time, so one has to keep it charging all the time or remember to make periodic charges to be sure the lantern will work when the big storm takes the electricity out. The concept of a rechargeable emergency lantern is a bit flawed. The battery is fine."
1215,5,I purchased several of these 4 years ago. One for each of my vehicals key chains and several others as office gifts.<br />All i can say is they have come in handy numerious times and have held up perfectly.<br />Before TSA relaxed their restrictions on pointy object on planes I probably took one of these on 60 to 80 flights ond only had one taken away in Chicago.<br />Yes I would recomend!
1216,5,"I was a little nervous getting this replacement part for my failing OEM piece.  But the price was excellent and it is exactly like the original, except it doesn't sag which is what led me to replace.  Easy DIY repair, a screwdriver and about 60, 90 seconds tops, to remove the old and put this in place.  Search youtube and you'll find a vid of a guy doing this one handed in under 3 minutes."
1217,5,I got these because there are very few pink seat covers out there. But when they got here I LOVED them!
1218,5,It seems to work fine with out any problems and it going good! It works fine and it save money at the same time.
1219,2,"I am not impressed with these handle bars at all, the horn sticks so don't use it. they don't fell sturdy and even the dealer I had install them told me I got had. But I will make the best of it, I couldn't afford to have them remove and wait for mail return."
1220,4,Great cart for moving stuff to and from  car /apartment. Rolls sommthly but could use a handle that is height ajustable
1221,3,It worked pretty good but was not great. I was hoping that it would permeate the crack and be a little more like a super glue. But it was more like a watery silicone. It didn't permeate the crack but instead covered it without being a large goopey blob on the glass itself. But you can tell it will also eventually peel off and need to be done again.
1222,3,Lenses are pretty good.<br />Few flaws with the craftsmanship though is that the lens sealer was still tacky (which can lead to leaks in the future) and the levels that where in the headlights were nowhere close to being accurate.
1223,4,"Comes with attractive screw covers.<br />I used it on a 2014 Mazda CX5, but it would work fine on<br />any car.  There is no brand logo, which is one thing I liked about it."
1224,5,AMAZING improvement. Very bright and wide angle. Added pictures comparing the LED to stock and a night shot on the product page. Will buy more from here. Hope the lights last.
1225,2,Poor manufacturing. It tore after the second day and I was not doing any rigorous activity. I should have paid less and purchased an Ace or Mueller.
1226,2,"I bought this conversion for a Jeep wrangler YJ. the housing does not fit in the stock lamp mounts unless altered, The bulbs that it comes with are not necessarily the best quality one burnt out after about the 15th time being used. In all i will be taking out this conversion and going with a different variety of conversion housing."
1227,5,"This has worked great.  We've had sand, dirt, mud, etc. and nothing gets on the carpet.  This is a must if you're hauling stuff around."
1228,5,"The real deal.  OEM made in Japan, very high quality, probably Toyota's OEM source.  Highly recommend for 1997 Toyota Tacoma."
1229,5,"You need to replace cables often anyway, why waste money on more expensive equivalents?<br /><br />...and, no, you don't need Gore-Tex. That's why they took those off the market..."
1230,5,"This is another STEELER product I LOVE to put onto my New Truck soooo, Thank You for having this item."
1231,5,"smells a bit when you first get it, but does its job.  fits snug in 2014 Mazda 6 and 2001 Subaru Impreza."
1232,5,This stuff is awesome!  I loaded it into my Screaming Eagle and the shifting and operation is so smooth. I ordered another set for my riding buddy in California and two other friends are using Red Line as well.<br /><br />An unscientific poll of Harley mechanics yielded the information that a high number of them put Red Line in their own bikes.  What does that tell you?
1233,4,"The only complaint I have is that the way it was packaged gave it a shape that was not consistent with the originally manufactured  shape, which made it slightly more difficult to install"
1234,5,"I bought this to replace my company's lanyard, and I must say; it checked all the boxes. It's made of a high quality material and really is a TRUE BLUE"
1235,5,For the price they are great! Love rocking these when I'm driving in my bagged jetta. They don't feel cheap. Nice tint to them. Considering a second pair
1236,5,I did not have any problems with the connection process seeing that all the wires matched up perfectly!!<br />Everything is working especially my factory amplifier and subwoofer!! ;-)
1237,3,I have one of these in my 2012 Rv and it kept alarming.  I hope that by replacing it will satisfy the alarm from going off even when in storage.  I tried all of the recommended solutions and none worked.  I hope that this does if not I will have to replace with something different.
1238,3,"This doesn't look like a genuine Auto expressions shade, as i have bought Auto expression shades before from stores with AE tags, Well for the review, i bought 2 sets (4 pieces) it works well but its not for every car, for my 04 corolla its short on the sides and too high for the height. but it works ok."
1239,4,"Performed adequately. Build is good. Not sure if it's the best value for the money. I would prefer one where you can install the fitting first with a socket, then screw on the hose. Instructions were great."
1240,5,I purchased for a 2007 wrangler. The console lid cracked and this was a great solution to replacing entire lid. Seriously took only 2 minutes to install. This is the perfect height to rest my arm now and no longer hard plastic but a nice cushioned arm rest.
1241,1,"I bought this (made in china) product 2 months ago for my Ducati 696 (large). The first two weeks the product worked well, after a rain storm the bike was dry 90%, then everything started to get worst to the point that yesterday rained a little bit, so I checked the bike after that, and let me tell you, 80% of the bike was wet.<br />This is a bad quality product made in china by an American company, if you need a cover for your bike 100% waterproof this is not what you want.<br />I wish some body have told me this before I bought it based on wrong reviews"
1242,3,"The single seat covers work great, they have a little bit of a bunching issue. The problem is the bench cover, it doesnt work for the long bench seat in my Ford Freestyle."
1243,4,"Right size, sealed, made my atv run like new. I would recommend this battery. Very good value for the price."
1244,5,"I used these when changing the a/c cooling fan on my sister's CR-V. I have a CR-V also, bought used, and only when I started replacing her clips did I look and see that I was missing about 10 also! Glad to be able to buy in bulk for so cheap. Work perfectly."
1245,4,"I've been using FRAM air filters on my vehicles since I started driving. At every oil change, I blow any dirt and debris out of the filters and replace them at least once per year (sooner if they appear extremely dirty).<br /><br />The price of these filters is easy on my wallet and usually FRAM is offering some sort of rebate."
1246,4,works good! good to bring car in when fuel pumps are dead! a lot cheaper then BG kit. good buy!
1247,5,"The Fiamm AM80 horns are getting very hard to find since they were discontinued around 2005. I truly prefer the AM80 model over the newer AM80S because the AM80's are louder and actually a bit bigger in size compared to the AM80S. Check the local salvage yards, you can find these babies pretty easily there. I have three AM80 horns wired up at once on my Impala. I have one low note AM80 and two high note AM80 horns. With a little tweaking, you can get them to have a triple note sound to them. Be sure your car can handle doing something like that if you ever try, I think these horns take about 5 amps of power each as my Impala has a 15 amp fuse for the horn and 4 horns break the fuse. But with the AM80, you can't go wrong. The AM80S models do sound a little nicer but they aren't as loud and attention getting as the AM80 is and that's what the horn is all about, safety and attention getting. And the package shown here is the high note, the Fiamm high notes always have the mouth facing right and the low notes have the mouth facing left. Just a little FYI there. The horn out of the package is a low note."
1248,1,Sucked! Came out like water and it wasn't the perfect shade of red. I sprayed it on as light as I could and it still dripped.
1249,4,I like the construction of the blades being wide. I like the shape of the handles and did not find them slippery as one reviewer had stated. I've pried really hard where I would expect a cheap bar to bend but these did not. Only 4 stars because one of the handles spins slightly on the metal shaft. I didn't bother to  request an exchange on this because it doesn't come off and actually gives you a different grip variation. I don't regret buying these at all.
1250,5,Another great addition for my truck.  Again use the welder adhesive to add some more strenth to the application. I am running out of Petco products to buy for my truck lol.
1251,5,"Only place I could find it , looked in several local large chain auto parts stores..Amazon comes through ..again and again"
1252,4,"If you know how to use any fine tip screwdriver, this product should work fine for you.  Just be gentle, make sure it is seated firmly in the screw head, and you won't have a problem.  I removed and replaced all of the screws in my WII with no damage to screws or to screwdriver."
1253,5,"A repair manual is a must have unless you take your bike to the shop every time. I like working on my own stuff. Can't wait to use this one. I've had great success with Clymer manuals in the past, I have no doubt this one will be the same."
1254,4,"This is a great product, exactly what I needed for a project I was building for my guest room.  What I didn't do is pay attention to the product description and only ordered one thinking I was getting a pair.  By the time the bracket arrived and I'd discovered my mistake, I didn't have time to order the second.  Unfortunately, now that I have both brackets, my guests have come and gone and my enthusiasm for the project has taken a back seat to others.  I'll finish it eventually, probably when my guests come back next year."
1255,5,"I use this kit to patch my motorcycle innertube.  Used every patch in the kit over a period of 12-18 months, and every one held just fine.  Small (penny-sized) patches work for single punctures, large patches work for double/group-perforation (staples and such). My tires run 30 psi, so I can't vouch for high pressure bike tires.<br /><br />Buying two more kits, because obviously the road around here is complete crap."
1256,5,we put this fan in a 1999 dodge durango and we all know how much gass the drink/eat up so we put this fan in before 9.5 mpg now 14.9 mpg major difference!!!
1257,3,"These retainers are shiny and hard compared to the OEM (Honda/Acura) retainers which are matte and softer. The harder plastic makes these retainers more brittle than the OEM version. The shape is also slightly different, although they seem to fit fine."
1258,4,"The PAB8208 I received is Made in Korea. Fits perfectly. As compared to dealer's parts prices this is a great bargain !<br /><br />Although filtering material is slightly thinner as compared to OEM's, the filter is extremely well made & can be \\""considered\\"" an alternative without hesitation. If thicker will be 5 Stars, therefore its a 4 (for now...).<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Previously used Mann-Filter MA 1073 & WIX 46215."
1259,5,As described.<br />Easy to install (electrical plugs matched up perfectly)<br />Works well. Seems to be very good quality.<br />Great value as the other coils were much more expensive.<br />The only question is how long do they last.
1260,4,Worked great under my travel trailer stabilizer jacks. Only thing I didn't like was the dirt that was caked in the open criss-cross pattern on the under side. Had trouble getting it out. Didn't want to put it in the storage compartment with all that dirt in there.
1261,5,Good fit. Warm but puffy looking. Great everyday jacket for colder weather. Fleece lining is makes for a comfortable wear.
1262,1,I bought this because I lease my car and needed something that could just stick onto my car. Unfortunately it only latest for about ten seconds and it is now just rolling around in my trunk.
1263,2,"Be careful buyer. The item I received only included 2 mats, despite the product packaging suggesting that there were 4. Unsure if I have to buy another set for my rear floor mats."
1264,5,If you own a JK your hood probably flutters up and down at speed.This product is a simple fix.10 minutes to install and your hood is rock solid regardless of your speed.Great product but IMO highly over priced.
1265,5,The contents were exactly as described.  I felt the kit was worth the money and arrived in a relatively short time.  My current needs were for the clock oil for the mechanism along with the cotton gloves for handling the weights.  The remainder of this kit will get used in the near future as I repair the chime mechanism.
1266,5,"You do not have to spend USD $300.00 to buy Cobra-specific calipers just to use the Cobra's 11.65&#34; (inch) rotors on a SN95 brake upgrade!<br /><br />All you need is:<br /><br />1. Your stock, existing 1994-2004 V6 or GT rear calipers*.  Remove the existing caliper brackets and brake pads.<br />2. Buy two of these Cardone 14-1042 brake caliper brackets.  Swap the guide pins and onto the new brackets.<br />3. Buy a set of 1994-2004 Cobra rear brake pads.<br /><br />* If you have a 1979-1993 or 1993 Cobra, just pull off a 1994-2004 V6 or GT rear caliper set at the junkyard.  You don't need the brackets, just the part that has VARGA cast into it.  You will have to buy a set of guide pins (or if your old ones are rusted/bent) from Amazon, etc., since these brackets don't come with any accessories (except the rubber boots that you will also need).  I used Dorman HW14082.<br /><br />Swap 2. and 3. onto 1., and you have the exact equivalent of Cobra calipers!<br /><br />* * *<br /><br />Now to actually mount these &#34;Cobra&#34; calipers onto your 1979-2004 Mustang, you will need several other parts:<br /><br />First remove (and sell) the drum brakes and axle-to-drum brake backing plate (1979-93 cars) or the axle-to-brake caliper bracket adapter (this is what Ford calls it, regular people just call it a bracket as well, creating confusion) which should be marked F3ZC-2C100-AA (RH) and F3ZC-2C101-AA (LH) on a 1993 Cobra, or F4ZC-2C10X-AD if you're removing from a 1994+ car.<br /><br />Next, with all the money you get from selling your used parts, buy the expensive Ford Racing's M-2300-M kit.  On Amazon it's called a &#34;1994-2004 Ford Mustang Rear Brake Bracket Upgrade Kit w/ Rotors, Braces, & Shields&#34; but it works with 1979-93 Mustangs as well.  With this, and a few other parts, you too can have 2004 Cobra-spec REAR disc brakes!<br /><br />Or, if you prefer the &#34;buy it piece-by-piece&#34; method, just go to a junkyard or online retailer; here is what I've gathered you need:<br /><br />The following items are from the M-2300-M kit:<br /><br />A. Rear-axle-housing to Cobra-brake-caliper-bracket adapter/flange/bracket: F4ZZ-2C101-B (LH) and F4ZZ-2C100-B (RH).  These are stamped F4ZC-2C10X-BA (so if someone is misrepresenting F4ZC-2C10X-DA parts as Cobra, don't be a sucker)!<br /><br />B. Moan brackets. These are very important for proper alignment; don't buy just the adapters/flanges/brackets in A. without buying these at the same time.  Separately they are pricey! Ford P/Ns are F4ZZ-2C367-A (LH) and F4ZZ-2C366-A (RH). Be extremely careful as the Cobra ones look ALMOST EXACTLY as the V6/GT ones, some are marked &#34;COBRA&#34; some are not, except the Cobras are about 1&#34; (inch) longer.  Hard to tell by eye, so go with a reputable source.<br /><br />C. Rotors: Two F4ZZ-2C026-B.  You can get aftermarket Bendix or even cheaper, depending on your budget.<br /><br />D. Dust Shields: Two F4ZZ-2C028-A.  These are optional.<br /><br />E. Parking Brake Cables, and Adjuster:  This is for 1979-93 cars, and depends on year.  There are plenty of websites that detail the conversion, but for 1987-1992 (not 1993) the cable to get is P/N LRS-2635D, which replaces Ford Racing's M-2809-A.  The adjuster is M-2810-A.<br /><br />F. If you are doing the rear brakes, you already have a car with 4-wheel-discs (1993 Cobra, 1994-04 Mustang) or have already converted the front brakes to Cobra spec and hence have a larger master cylinder (M/C) with at least a 1.0&#34; (inch) bore.  1987-93 cars require conversion to a 1993 Cobra M/C, and 1979-86 cars require converting to a 1984-85 SVO M/C.<br /><br />Have fun!"
1267,4,"I like it, used it once in the lighter socket of a RAV4, worked good.  Stored it in the back, more use might have given it a 5."
1268,5,I loved my butterfly but I woke up this morning and it was gone!! don't know if it blew off or someone stole it!!!  very bummed!!
1269,5,This is the first product that I've purchased from Carefree and all I have to say is...NICE! Very easy to install and the quality is exceptional. Installation instructions are very thorough and are easy enough to understand for any do-it yourselfer! Great job CAREFREE!
1270,5,"As the subject title suggests, this products worked well for me.  I followed the instructions and keep it at the right temperature.  In addition I acknowledged that some things would work in a few hours and others needed to soak overnight.  This product removed all the rust on my automobile parts.  However, DO NOT BUY the advertised Dry Coat product that Metal Rescue suggests.  It DID NOT WORK for me and all the products started re-rusting immediately.  As such, I reused Metal Rescue (which again worked well), and painted and primed the products as needed instead with great results.  I recommend this product for most rust issues, though perhaps not extreme cases.  Remember, it is not naval jelly, so you need to soak the rusted parts for extended periods of time, at the correct temperature, and in a plastic bin (buy separately since plastic does not react with it)."
1271,1,"Due to photographic trickery, the decal is much smaller than you'd believe it to be. The main problem however is THE PRICE! Ten dollars for such a small decal?? Shop around before buying this one! Most SIG decals are in the $3 to $4 price bracket and this one is nothing worthy of such a high price. I sent mine back and at least they gave me a full refund. Defend the Second Amendment! SIG Forever!!"
1272,4,Not bad .. They fit a little loose but work.. So tape them in. Good blue light thou. And all lights worked.
1273,3,"I buy this for the boyfriend of a co-worker. Is just like the picture, but not to big. Special for those BMW fanatics"
1274,5,"as it states it was stolen right out of the receiver. my stupidy for leaving it on the truck. the new one is an exact replacment. and the price was a lot cheaper than camping world or any one else.it even came with the torsion arm lift pipe which is longer than the origional, which is a big help gices you more leverage.. thanks much///"
1275,5,"I bought these to replace my stock tail light in my motorcycle.  Just one is brighter then what was in there.  I plan on changing out all of the lights on the bike, that these will fit."
1276,5,"I put this bag on my 2003 Honada Shadow Spirit 750. I already had a sissy bar on my bike and it slides right over it and buckles down in seconds. More than 90% of the time, I am riding the bike by my self so I really love this bag for the following reason. This bag can be used as a backrest and it fits just right on my bike. I can enjoy long rides without the back aches and you can fit a whole lot of stuff in this bag. It is made very strong and I can see it lasting for years to come. I will definitley buy another one of these bags when the time comes."
1277,5,"Loved the product, it was bright hot pink & it stuck really good.It could of been a little larger but it worked for what I was doing."
1278,5,I could not ask for a better or easier installation.  30 minutes end to end and I probably wasted 10 minutes just tinkering around.<br />The hardware is good. The internal nut-plates are strong and gave me no troubles fitting up inside the frame.<br />The hole alignment on the hitch to my frame was *PERFECT* and it went together as slick as can be.<br />I like the round tube version like this better as I feel round is torsionally stronger than square tubing.<br />When was the last time you saw a square tube driveshaft? :-)<br />Good job Reese.  No disappointments here.
1279,5,"Fairly aggressive, and a great shine when done, but plan on using some elbow grease! I had to repair damage to my gelcoat where it had been pulled loose from improper mounting of trim tab actuators. (Someone used 3M 5200 as a sealer and made it nearly impossible to seperate them from the transom. I filled damaged areas with gelcoat, then sanded down to 800 grit. Took my angle buffer to it with Meguiar's Marine One-Step Compound at 1500 rpm. I did this in two passes In under two minutes and everything came up to a brilliant shine again. I haven't even put a final wax coat on yet and it already looks excellent. Great product in my opinion. I highly recommend it to save time and money. Some effort is required to get the shine to come up, but well worth it!"
1280,5,I just installed the Dorman 509-208 on my 06 Torrent and the seat belt light  went off as it was supposed to. Thanks for the product it worked great and only cost about one/third as much as the dealer wanted.
1281,1,"This was an awful buy because it never even was delivered to me, making it so I basically spent money for nothing at all. I know it wasn't even much money, but I would have liked to have at least gotten what I had paid for. This is awful and don't waste your money."
1282,2,The &#34;product was not as &#34;pictured&#34; however I found out that the problem is with ACDelco picture not the reseller's information.
1283,5,"I ordered these because they are advertised \\""error free\\"" and they are in my 1998 MB E300D.  Bright bluish light."
1284,3,"They're pricy compared to a $.99 2 pack of running light bulbs, but they have a cool blue light and are pretty bright.  I bought them for looks, not for function.  The standard bulbs work just fine and last about 1.5 years.  I've only had these LED lights in my Silverado as daytime running lights for about 2 months.  Hopefully they will last.  Otherwise it's back to the $.99 2-pack of standard bulbs."
1285,5,"good price<br />good quality<br />excellent time for delivery<br /><br />it is exactly as described, a great deal for your money, i would buy again from this brand."
1286,4,This is a regular oem part so nothing to really say besides that it is build with normal oem quality and that it had no defects upon arrival.
1287,5,"works perfectly to adjust torsion bars on the gm, it is truck easy to it is use and made well"
1288,5,"I replaced 4 quarts of the AT fluid in our 150k 2004 Sienna with this fluid. The van had some minor shifting issues when cold (In the past I have replaced with stock Toyota fluid slightly less than the recommended interval up to this point). I ran a can of Seafoam Trans Tune in it, drained the fluid, replaced the strainer behind the pan, cleaned the pan and magnets, and put in this product to the full level. The transmission is shifting much like new and the van is overall more pleasant to drive. The product smells pretty bad but that's only while performing the maintenance. Very satisfied with the results."
1289,2,"I bought this jack, and was amazed how beefy it is.  It weighs near 100lbs.. and jacked up my F150 with ease.  I like the \\""1 pump\\"" feature to get the service jack from a seated position up to the frame of the truck.  It was only 3-4 more pumps before the front tire was a few inches off the ground.<br /><br />I did return the service jack in exchange for a new one because it leaked oil when I bled the system of air.  The directions for this service jack, like others, is to turn the handle counterclockwise and pump 6 times.  I didn't notice at first, but every pump with the handle turned fully counterclockwise caused ATF to drop on the floor.  I called tech support and they said that should not have happened.  I replicated the problem with them on the phone, and they said to return it.  Note: When I have the value all the way open, and then turn the handle one revolution to close it (so it was like 90% open), it would not leak ATF even when pumping.  I wonder if you shouldn't have it all the way open when pumping in order to purge any air (just like other jacks).<br /><br />The packaging is poor.  The front casters were sticking through the box.  The jack was in perfect condition, minus the leaking issue (which may not even be an issue.. just poor directions in the manual).<br /><br />UPDATE: Received the new jack - it did better in transit than the previous jack.  This jack leaked as well when the handle was turned all the way counterclockwise (when bleeding the system of air).  I confirmed with tech support that you are not supposed to pen the handle all the way counterclockwise to bleed the system.  The directions were incorrect and need to be fixed.<br /><br />SECOND UPDATE: I changed my review from 5 stars to 2 stars for two reasons.  First, the manual says to fill with ATF.  When I called tech support, they researched it/talked to the tech support manager and definitely came back and said not to use ATF and that the manual was incorrect.  A week later I called back and presented the same question.. I spoke to the tech support manager and they said to only use ATF and that anything other than ATF would damage the seals.  When I told them that I got two different responses, they said that they don't even manufacturer the product.. someone in China makes it and puts OTC's label on it.<br /><br />Second, the plug to get to the ATF/hydraulic fluid/whatever? is a threaded screw.  However, it is very difficult to get the screw off the housing.  When the screw is fully seated, its countersunk.. when you fully loosen the screw, the screw head is flush with the housing so there is nothing to grab.  Its a pain to try and check the fluid level when you can grab the screw.  On a positive note.. its a screw versus one of those rubber caps that are a pain to get back on."
1290,5,"The adaptor fit perfectly and quickly installs.  The Capture plate uses a Nylon spacer to secure it, not sure how that will hold up over time or with frequent use."
1291,5,"When I moved to Fla. to live with my Mom upon my Fathers death,  I discovered that there was no wheel barrow.  With very little storage space I needed something. That didn't take up much space.  This is the perfect solution. For my problem."
1292,5,Great protection for carpet and are easy to clean.  Clean up nicely with just water and a papertowel.  Had for a previous vehicle and really liked how clean the floor remained.
1293,5,Fits right in perfectly. Can smell the difference instantly. Definitely worth the money. Also have clean air coming through now. You would not believe how dirty the old one was
1294,5,so my son read this one day at a birthday party in which the theme was star wars. he liked it so I surprised him by getting it for him. we have since placed it on his sax case and it looks really good.
1295,5,"went in easy and bolted on perfectly, the hitch bolted on perfectly, This is a great goosneck and resessed into the bed"
1296,4,"I like the tray, however, the strap that holds it on the seat goes through the middle of the back, so the try tends to tilt too far forward. The drink holder keeps a cup in there, but anything on the table part could easily slide off. Still, for the price it works."
1297,5,"I bought this for a 2006 Pontiac GTO. It came with the throwout bearing attached. I removed the stock bleeder and replaced it with a braided remote bleeder.<br />So far, so good."
1298,5,I was able to buy four for the price of what a local shop wanted for one wheel cover.  I would highly recommend these wheel covers as they are good quality at a great price.
1299,4,"a good standard filter. I wish amazon had an auto reminder for these things, where it remembered my car model and suggested filter."
1300,5,"Excellent product and I use it regularly. I've used plenty of detail sprays from Chemical Guys, and they're all solid products... much better than anything you can find in a store.<br /><br />I think maybe the only store-sold product close to CG's detail spray is Armour All's carnauba detailer in the orange bottle. Rating CG's products at a 5, with 5 being the best, the AA product is perhaps a 3 compared to CG's most average product.<br /><br />This Synthetic detailer is as good as their White Carnauba (blue color), and every bit as good as their more pricey Hybrid 07 detailer (orange color).<br /><br />Buy it, try it, you'll be pleased."
1301,1,Looked nice. New keys and key locks. Turns out they would not fit the Nineteen ninety three Dodge Truck 250.
1302,5,Graet product<br />I have a 97 Accord. You can't go wrong with this replacement for the price. Exact fit and an easy install
1303,5,These turbo inlets are the same quality of Samco and Perrin without the high price.  They offest the engine bay WITH functionality.  They are reinforced thru out the pipe which helps quite a bit.
1304,5,"This has all the specifications recommended by BMW for use in my E46 and thus this is what I use...Also far more accessible than the European castrol or BMW's own  5w30 oil..Buy from Amazon since it is cheap here, the local auto shops sells this for over ten dollars per quart. Walmart use to stock it at a good price but not anymore, I have placed three different orders online for pickup at various local Walmart's only to receive an email a couple hours later telling me they're refunding my money due to lack of stock; even though their lousy website claimed otherwise."
1305,2,The stripes came with wrinkles in the lay out so when it went to get installed there were to many wrinkles so it bubled up and wouldnt lay out. The product was ruined before i could even put it on.
1306,5,"we own too many Hondas (if there is such a problem) so the keys all look the same, so I got a few of these, they fit over the key perfectly and you can still use all the buttons. the pink one I got is also helping hold my broken key together. this is very stretchy stuff, you just pull it on. it also makes the keys less slippery if you set them on a counter or hard surface.  my cars these fit are Honda accord 2006 and civic 2012."
1307,5,"I've bought about 3 or 4 sets of these mirrors and I've never regretted it.  They are cheap and easy to install on various types of bars.  Easily adjustable and I've only had minor issues with some of them staying in place.  I broke my first set on a driveway drop, but didn't feel bad because they are so inexpensive.  Once on, they provide good vision at a comfortable location right above your wrists.  Recommended!"
1308,4,The replacement fog light arrived exactly as described and installed in 20 minutes.  It even came with the lightbulb.  Very happy.
1309,4,This is a good product that performs the function intended.  I have found it fa easier to install than I thought it would be.  As far as durability - we will have to wait and see.
1310,2,It is just a another cheaply made cover. Would not purchase this item again. Rips easily and will not last.
1311,5,Mann makes great filters and they do it in the USA.  This filter went in to my Expedition with no problems.  I have never had a problem with a Mann filter I have installed.
1312,5,"Super quality.  Look great in my XLR.  Sadly I need to keep a plastic cover over them to protect them from daily dirt, but when I take off the plastic there are rich looking and clean."
1313,1,"I waste my monay in pice of garbeg, noise, squeel all the time no mater what you do to fix it and vibration."
1314,5,"Thia sticker is so cute, I love it! I get a lot of compliments on it and people think its cool! The people that made it did an awesome job! Thanks you!"
1315,5,Great Helmet that fits under my Aprilia Sportcity 300 seat!  better quality than much more expensive helmet than I have tried!!
1316,1,This seat is just OK for it's purpose. My only complaint is that it slides off of the seat and must be readjusted. I will need to modify the way it is attached to the car seat.<br /><br />Update: The strap broke off completely before any modifications. I now label this item junk and a waste of hard earned money. I must now look<br /> for another similar seat cushion.
1317,1,"In short, these fall off the walls, and can't even support their own weight.<br /><br />I bought ten of these. What a mistake. I installed them to vinyl walls, having washed the wall with rubbing alcohol first to clean the contact points. They looked pretty good. Then, one month later, after travelling on 0 (zero!) miles of bumpy roads, the temperature here popped up to 93 Fahrenheit yesterday. I went into the RV to finish a shower install I'm working on, and 7 of the 10 organizers were sitting on floors, counters, etc. where they fell to. To make it more annoying, many of them had stuck to things where they fell, and I had to peel off the glue. They cannot take the heat. Abject failure for RVs, which toast up in the sun.<br /><br />Oh, I didn't even mention that all 10 of them were empty, and never had any contents put in them at all. They were attached a month before and had plenty of time to cure/set.<br /><br />You would need to set these ON a counter AND glue to the wall if you wanted it to stay put.<br /><br />Allow me to recommend this:<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015ZY05U/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br />I bought four of those clear holders at the same time, and they are all doing just fine. They use screws AND sticky tape, so stay on. Plus, it is easier to see the contents since they are clear."
1318,2,"Product looks ok. It doesn't really appear that it would hold much, maybe a few small items. Doesn't matter much because it will not fit on a Arctic Cat Wildcat. It sticks way out on each side. I unfortunately procrastinated returning it beyond Amazons return policy. Look for it at a future garage sale. I did see one on a Ranger. It looked like it fit nicely on that machine. I'm still not too impressed with its capacity though."
1319,5,"This is a great hitch, made in USA, good welds and finish. Shipping box was damaged and looks as though it was fully opened at staples and then taped shut. This kind of shipping damage seems common on hitches, but hitch was fine.<br /><br />Installation tips: First, you will need a second person for about 2 minutes while you put in the end bolts, then you can do the rest solo. I torqued up the end bolts then had to reloosen them because there was a gap at the center U-bolt attachment, but the gap was too small for the optional spacer there. Here is the correct way, will save you time: You have 2 optional shims for each big end bolt (4 total) to vary the fit of the hitch at the center tie-down loop (where you attach the U-bolt and nuts), plus one optional spacer for the loop itself. Hand tighten the end bolts and check the fit at the center loop, then either add the optional spacer at the loop, or add or subtract shims on the ends to get a good fit at the loop, so that it fits well at all three points before torquing, then torque the two end bolts, then torque the small U-bolt nuts at the loop. Another tip: The big end bolts fit into a square washer, and that washer will rotate as you try to torque the bolts. You may have to reach up there with an extra-large flat screwdriver wedged between the square washer and the frame to keep it from rotating as you torque the bolts. The torque is fairly high, 75 lb-ft as I recall (noted in instructions), spend $10 on sale at Harbor Freight and get a click-stop torque wrench and do it right. Except for the notes above,the hitch flew in, easy installation, no need to remove or cut anything.<br /><br />Lastly, I like the design. Attaching the hitch to the center loop low takes the fore and aft loads in shear better than just attaching the hitch at the frame, as the hitch drop would then put more torque into the frame, and that frame is pretty thin metal. Spreading the load in this fashion is better structurally and also allows thehitch to be a bit lighter. The center tie-down loop is heavily welded so is a good attachment point for the hitch."
1320,2,Advertisement stated these would fit a 2010 Jetta Sport Wagen; they do not fit.  Only two factory attachment holes lined up but the guard does not come close to fitting around the body line.
1321,5,"Perfect fit for my protégé. When your factory hose gets brittle and splits open, replace it with this part. It feels like better quality."
1322,1,Cheap. Stickers Werner aligned on right places on the dice. Definitely not worth 5.00 . Wouldn't waste time or money
1323,4,Expected hoodie to be of thicker quality for the price paid.Graphic design is awesome but expected better better quality fabric.
1324,1,This item does not in no way fit B5.5 passat. I would leave zero stars if I could. Waste of money.
1325,5,"I have four sets of these plus the caps and chocks in my trailer.  These make leveling a breeze, especially if you have a calibrated level on your trailer.  Find out how many inches you are out of plumb, stack up the approite number of blocks, drive forward or back and put your stack where the low wheel was, then drive back onto the stack.  The lynx chock comes in handy to let you know when you are on the stack in the right spot."
1326,5,"These are amazing!! Fit perfectly and protect the carpet on my car. I bought these just because I wanted the extra protection that these have against, spills, mud, dirt and just about anything else that might happen. I have to say these are the best floor mats I have ever owned... Bought 3 more sets for the family and I am now the best thing since sliced bread."
1327,5,very nice i like my drum very good product the drum look good and there got here fastif you need to bye drum
1328,5,"It's a nice product, all aluminum, certainly the best you can get for the price.  We bolted it directly to the floorboard of our car (vs using the clamps).  Very secure and quick to get the extinguisher out if needed (pull the pin)."
1329,5,My 19 yr old niece loves her Hell Kitty car set to go with her new car! It''s exactly what she wanted. It was delivered the same day I delivered her new car to her - talk about excellent timing!
1330,5,"Great stuff now I just be riding through town stunting and flashin on everyone.  people be like \\""who's that??!?!\\"" It attract a lot of speed demons though people always want to race me on those open roads when I get off work at night  girls love it as well lol"
1331,3,"I thought this would work for my motorcycle.  It was a little too large.  I returned it.  No problem, but I wanted something different."
1332,5,i know it is a bit of a hassle to put these on before you wear your pants but these knee pads will save you
1333,3,"I just got the AMC-400 rack and I will have spend a lot of time modifying it to fit my bike (Honda CT-90) so it will sit safely behind my Land Rover LR3.  The rack has several design flaws, but fortunately they are fairly easy to remedy.  Apparently this rack is made for a bike that is A LOT larger than a CT-90, although personally I would not be comfortable loading a bike that is larger and heavier than mine (210 lbs) onto this product.<br /><br />-The first thing I did was add four reflectors to the back of the rack, which faces traffic ($4 from the auto parts store). Safety first!<br /><br />-The tongue is too long so the rack is too far behind the vehicle and will tend to bounce and twist.  So I am going to drill a new 5/8\\"" hole for the hitch pin about two inches behind the old hole so that the tongue will be shorter and the bike will sit closer to the truck.  This will increase stability.<br /><br />-The square aluminum cross-beams have sharp edges that will damage rubber tires, they are welded up too high, and they have the wrong spacing for my bike's wheelbase.  So I'm going to saw three of them off and replace them with long bolts installed lower on the rack.  The bolts will have sections of steel pipe that will fill the gap between the rails, provide a good surface for the tires, and allow the tires to set several inches deeper in the rack.  This will be a lot safer.  I don't like how the tires could easily move off the rack in the stock configuration.<br /><br />-The rails are spaced much too far apart (5.5\\"") for my Honda CT-90's (3\\"") tire width.  I will bolt wood spacers on the inside of the rails so the wheel cannot travel sideways.  This will prevent damage to the wheels/tires, and keep them from moving around.<br /><br />So it is a bit of a pain to make this thing work, but I think it will be OK.<br />And I saved $30 shipping buying on eBay rather than Amazon!"
1334,3,It does great for emptying a brake reservoir but for bleeding brakes.. not so well.. but will keep it..<br />ok

1336,5,"I've always used the Mann Filter, and I've ALWAYS been pleased.  It comes with the proper o rings for my TDI, and fits perfectly. My car has almost a quarter million miles, and I expect to get that much more.  Thanks, MANN filter company for a great product."
1337,5,I purchased these for my 328i and they could not fit better. Love them for winter driving. Priced great also. Can't go wrong with WeatherTech. I have them in 4 different vehicles and all fit like a glove in each one.
1338,5,"Received it 2nd day with free shipping and it was considerably cheaper here on Amazon than anywhere else I saw online. The procedure for filling the battery and getting it ready for use was easy. Ordered Monday, received/filled/charged Wednesday, and drove motorcycle Friday. I'll just have to see how well it lasts."
1339,5,"Was able to wire it in to my car very easily.  The color coding was not the same as my vehicle, but it did not matter, I was able to wire it correctly."
1340,5,This was exactly what I needed. It was very easy to install with the help of a YouTube video I found.
1341,5,The order came on time product was neatly packaged in the box. All the parts were there installed in the car fells and sounds great.
1342,5,"Fantastic tank at this price. Free shipping is a huge bonus! Before you buy anywhere else, consider the shipping cost before you decide. This is a very solid tank. It weighs 200 lbs, despite the description. Tends to get scratches on the paint from handling, so have a white spray paint can handy.  Baffles are good, no weight shifts when driving."
1343,5,great item . works really good . thanks ...i used all the time to scan my cars and saves me the trip to the shop..
1344,5,"Good quality, I like these. I like the screw on style better than the glue on style. Would like the antenna in red or blue."
1345,4,It's amazing how hard it is to find hitch light covers for a 1-1/4&#34; receiver.<br /><br />This fits either size receiver.<br /><br />Shipping was prompt and packaging was done well.
1346,1,"I ordered brake pads for my 2009 Jetta TDI, I received something thats not correct for my vehicle. Now I need to figure out how to return the wrong parts."
1347,5,"This took my serviceman just over an hour to install both units into my Toyota Corolla. The only issue he encountered was the way Toyota routed the brake lines which due to the age and corrosion of the old units he had to cut the old mounts away from the old units.<br />They noticeably raised the rear of the car back to its original ride height, and restored that new car feel, both in its ability to absorb road bumps and high speed highway tracking.<br />My car had 145,000 miles when these were installed and now I am considering installing new front struts also. When I feel it needs it, I will get the front version of theses."
1348,1,"Don't buy this! The picture shows a set of tail lights, but it's only the driver side. I was very disappointed."
1349,5,"After key was cut I was able to complete the programing with no problems, delivery was supper fast and the key looks factory hope this helps."
1350,1,This is merely a 12v extension cord.  The 3 AC outlets in it do not work.  it is not worth the money.  Buy one local where you don't have to mess with the postage to send this back.
1351,5,"I always wanted a Harley and last year I bought one.  So I wanted to get a jacket and chaps to get the total biker look.  I wasn't sure about the quality of these items but with the good reviews and low price, I thought I'd take a chance.  So far I've worn the items three times for a total of 130 miles in 25-38 degree temps and I like them. The sizing instructions on the chaps were right on.  I've never worn chaps before so it's quite an experience putting these on but they offer great wind protection and I imagine some degree of protection in a fall and from flying road debris (like small rocks).  Anyway, I'm very comfy wearing them and think they offer a greater degree of safety than pants alone.  I had been wearing lycra tights, thermal undies and then pants but I can wear just the pants and chaps and still be warm and certainly more stylish.  I used a set of surgical shears to cut the legs to the right length which took about two minutes.  If the zippers and snaps last, then these chaps are a winner.  One caveat: if you're interested in these, also check out the braided ones.  Had I seen those before I placed my order, I would have gone with them.  Anyhow, great product and good sizing instructions. Oh, and the shipping was extremely fast -- I placed my order on Tuesday and the chaps and jacket arrived on Friday from North Carolina.  Great job !!"
1352,1,Bought this pump to siphon gas out my truck for my generator. The pump failed miserably - not a single drop of gas came out after 5 minutes of pumping.
1353,5,"A high quality product, easy to use, simple to store, and looks nice from outside the car. I'd recommend it!"
1354,5,Easy to use. LED light is bright for bicycle riding at night. Comes with rechargeable batteries & wall charger. Optimal for commuting :-)
1355,1,"UPDATE: Failed after 5 months. Wont buy again. July 20, 2013<br /><br />Orginally rated this 4 stars, dropping it down to one now.<br /><br />February 20, 2013<br />\\""I bought this for a 2005 F150 5.4 rear wheel drive only . The boot was not the right size. I ended taking the old boot from the old coil and using that, but kept the spring of the new coil spring. Took a minute to change out. Just be aware you might have to do that. I am still happy with this purchase.\\"""
1356,5,"I purchased this sticker well over a year ago, it is on my back window of my car, and I live in the desert.  This sicker has not started to peel or fade!!"
1357,5,I love everything Mickey. He is a world ambassador which makes him even more special. How can you not love his happy eyes along with his happy smile?
1358,5,This item is worth the money. It has answered many questions and is very helpful to my husband in fixing the car. It has saved us lots of money.
1359,1,"The remote was shaped the same way as mine, but the buttons are in different places, the back is shaped differently because of the case, and the inside is different from the memory board. My memory board would not fit!!!"
1360,5,This product looks great and is very reflective. I wanted that extra bit of safety and looks from the product; i put it on the back of my helmet and it really lights up when you shine a light on it.
1361,5,"Got these as replacements for my wife's 2004 Expedition. Her original ones had 160,000 miles on them. They were easy to install since I didn't have to change the springs on them. And the cost was less than just the strut without the spring at my local auto parts store. Win Win!!"
1362,5,"I used this to build my first \\""sports\\"" exhaust system (2\\"") and found it absolutely invaluable!  It was able to quickly and easily stretch the mild steel pipe I was using.  As I was cutting & welding combo bends, the ability to slot pipes together was extremely useful for getting tricky angles right, particularly with tight spaces over the diff and suspension components.  Simply slot the pieces together, give a slight twist as needed, then spot weld once in position.  I added a couple of sets of flanges to allow easy removal, and again used the tool to stretch the pipe for a snug fit into flanges. It happily bends on both straight pipe and bends (without heating). I would highly recommended this tool to anyone attempting to build an exhaust, or who does frequent repairs.  The tool is well constructed, is very solid, and does a great job.  It is very easy use and gives a consistently smooth, even finish."
1363,5,These worked great in the older W123 Benz.  Started right up.  You need to wire them in parallel and remove the resistor wires.
1364,5,I replace my wipers every once in a while and I usually just buy them from some local store.  This time I saw a deal on these wipers and I thought to give it a try.  It installed very easily and works really well.  So far so good and I'm going to buy more for my other cars.
1365,5,This OBDII is very easy to use and to understand the problem in your car. It help me find out what is wrong with my car and save money and time.
1366,4,"This light is easily installed. The turn signals are bright, and easily visible . I recomend this light to those who ride at night."
1367,3,"Looks like it's well made. But didn't fit my 2004 Toyota tacoma. No matter how many ways with the parts that came with it, it wouldn't work. If it came with a 4\\"" extention I can make it work. I'll try to out-source the parts. Really should of researched it better."
1368,5,I bought a used camera (Fuji X100) but didn't get a charger.  I bought this one and it works perfectly with my OEM batteries as well as the ones I bought after-market.
1369,2,The mount was an exact fit for my truck. The only bad thing was that parts were missing such as mounting brackets and and adhesive pads. The description DID NOT say that parts were missing.
1370,4,Good service but product is a little small for my Ram truck. Got it around steering wheel eventually but doesn't cover entirely.
1371,5,"I make my own glass cleaner and it contains a bit of corn starch in it. This is inexpensive to make and is a great cleaner! However, the cornstarch KILLS lesser spray bottles. I've taken to just re-using other bottles for 1-2 times before they have to get trashed. However, this bottle stands up and hasn't clogged yet. Very happy."
1372,5,"Fits really nice.  Came with hardware to install and took maybe 20-30 minutes to install. Easier than I thought, &  looks great!!"
1373,5,I have not had to use this yet. Seems sturdy. Carry it when I travel. Seems like it was charged when it got here. Checked it twice now -- once after being in the cold for a couple of weeks -- same charge level showed. Hope it works if I need it to work.
1374,5,"First, this is not some pump you throw in and bam, water comes out.  You need to work on it a bit and I recommend practicing with it so you know how to use it.  I use it to transfer water when camping to other containers so not to spill anything. Not water in the mountains so I need to watch every drop on long trips. It comes out fast once started.  Great product and should be in every camping containing."
1375,5,"I always get compliments on my floor mats.  They've never malfunctioned, rolled up on the edges, or anything.  Good buy."
1376,5,WeatherTech is in both of my vehicles! clean up is a breeze the tough material is super protective!!!<br /><br />I spilled chinese food on the way home one day and the sauce leaked out... but the WeatherTech mat collected most of it and channeled the rest out of the door.  A rag wiping later... 100% perfect!<br /><br />If WeatherTech was a woman... I marry her!!!
1377,4,These are very good wipers and I recommend them to Minnesotans and others. Best I have tried. go get this wiper
1378,5,love it and it came in good condition and tray it it work good .. but hope soon you guy seal 240 one cus i have to get converter volt for it .
1379,5,"I have used Formotion products (clocks, thermometers and compasses) for the last twelve years and found them to be indestructible. The only problem I've had was when a compass fell off at 65 mph and broke. (My fault for not securing the attachment bolt tight enough) Their gauges can be installed several different ways. The clocks keep accurate time and the batteries last a long time. I've even used them on my boat with excellent results. I have no reservations about recommending them to anyone."
1380,5,"this is sturdy enough to be used as a bumper sticker for a vehicle or as a sticker anywhere else. i have put mine on a binder that i use to keep my notes in for a class on Hebrews i am taking at church. the statement on the sticker is quite true, and it is also a great conversation piece.  this would make a good gift for somebody who you know is a Christian and has a sense of humor!"
1381,2,"A friend bought me this tail as christmas gift, because it was on my wishlist. Seeing as the tail was advertised as \\""large\\"" I assumed it would be at least 12 inches long. The tail I received is only 8 inches, and hardly what I would call large. It is very soft, though."
1382,3,Turtle wax version works faster with results pretty much the same. The turtle waxes version is half the cost as well. The 3m directions are not well written.
1383,4,"Works like a charm...  Dormanis good stuff, not junk imported from China.  Push comes to shove, it works... good stuff.."
1384,5,Exactly what I was looking for. This has a glass face and and plastic backing that is well made. It fits perfectly on my 98 vw golf.
1385,4,My husband loved them but would have liked to see something come with it to hang them up. Thank you!
1386,3,"OK! Thanks. This fixes my car. Thanks for this design and cutting satisfying. Hopefully, I will return to buy again with other car."
1387,1,"me siento muy decepcionado por la compra de este articulo ya que los programas que trae son todos demos, y no he podido hacerle nada al carro, ofrecen los programas incluidos con la compra de este producto pero resulta que el cd que trae son un poco de demos basura que solo duran 5 segundos<br /><br />I am very disappointed with the purchase of this item because it brings programs are all demos, and I could not do anything to the car, offer the programs included with the purchase of this product but it turns out the cd are bringing some garbage demos only last 5 seconds"
1388,5,"Saved a bundle buying a set of these on Amazon.com. Easy to install, I used a grinder with a cutting blade to cut a slot through the bit surrounding the brake line on the rear struts. Much easier that taking apart the brake line."
1389,4,"This light is a good buy although the weird bright white light from an LED takes getting used to.  Also, the light seems to glow very faintly even when it's off- don't think it's an issue...<br /><br />I am just glad it was much cheaper than the bulbs I was buying from the local store and I got it within a week of ordering it which isn't typical when it's coming from overseas."
1390,4,"It's a great deal for a great product that can pump big tires, little tires, basketball's, exersize balls, etc.  You may need to plan for extra long vehicles on where to place your pump, but the length of hose and power clips is sufficient for the job.  Little cars rejoice, it's awesome!  Big long cars, just think about it, it will work. This compressor has a great screw-on function at the end of the hose to screw your air hose to the tire, which is essential in my opinion when you have to walk away and turn on the compressor.  If you hate the screw function they included the other type of press-on air hose receptacle, but I can't imagine wanting that for any car tire.  Really nice:  they included a metal needle point for inflating basketballs and kickballs, also another plastic point for the air hose to inflate mystery things that will come up such as exercise balls or possible air beds.  This pump is great for the family that has twelve tires, snow tires, bike tires, and a billion odds-and-ends that must get pumped!  Have not tried this on ballons, but will shortly for a birthday party.<br /><br />Some field observations:  Due to it's top-heavy design, it will fall over guaranteed, but it still pumps like a champ!  I suppose a less top heavy or different design might eliminate this problem in the future.  Also, it has a pressure gauge built-in that for me does not accurately enough tell me the pressure of my tires, it's off by 5 to 10 PSI every time.  Good thing I use a great tire gauge separately!  There is a light included with this pump by the the on/off switch that at first I thought useless but proved good in telling my I juiced up the compressor okay.  I suppose it's good to have some light in night situations, better than nothing!<br /><br />The power cord must be connected to a car battery.  This is not a bad thing folks!  First, you need the car battery function to avoid lame things like cigarette lighter power issues where the cigarette receptacle only handles so much juice or else it's tiny fuse blows out.  Little cars will likely blow their fuse on cigarette lighters, so why even try on a much bigger car?  I love the car battery function.  I take the pump with me in my little commuter car and cannot stand the gas station pumps where you stick a million quarters in and get what feels like 10 seconds of pumping, assuming the gas station pump even works after feeding it money!<br /><br />Small, compact, but extremely useful!andles so much juice or else it's tiny fuse blows out.

1391,5,"This item, when used with the Torque Pro Android App, is a real money saver.  It costs around $75 to get the fault codes reset at the dealerships. This item and the android app both cost less than $25. I've already save way more in repair fees than what I paid for it.  A worthwhile investment."
1392,5,"good job pront delivery and god quality in the product, properly packed it work with out a problem as soon as I stareted using it rrr"
1393,5,"Gives my Monster a great look and it's very bright! Installation was a breeze. I can't speak to their tail chop kit, but I'm very happy with my Evotech kit."
1394,5,Already used 20-30 times. Hasn't needed a charge yet! Starts any car truck up first try. Buy it and see for yourself!
1395,5,"After being highly recommended by a friend, I purchased it for my father - seemed like a very easy to use device, smaller than I expected (which is fine)."
1396,4,"This part is not quite as heavy as the factory tie rod assembly, but how heavy does it really need to be anyway?  It works just fine.  After a few months of use the only thing I have noted is that the bolts are getting a little bit rusty, something that happens on all metal under a car."
1397,4,"When s*** hits the fan, and all these zombies come out of the wood-work, some crazy ass governor is gonna need to see some proper permit.    I got mine. Of course there are no laws that state that you HAVE to take the zombie corpses with you. Just sayin'    In all seriousness; When I first got this item, I looked at it really close and did see some minor pixelation (another reviewer had mentioned this) but I had to really squint.    I posted this on my bumper. So unless the car behind me is kissing my cars ass, or someone in the parking lot is on their hands and knees checking my sticker out, no one will know.    This looks like a regular permit from far away, but there's a secret satisfaction with knowing that I'm being a secret zombie nerd."
1398,5,"The &#34;check engine&#34; light usually refers to an emission problem.  There is a senser in the gas fill pipe that detects gas vapor leaking out.  Even if the gas cap is on tight, it may be worn out.  This is a common problem for the 2004 Corolla. Since paying $7.00 for a new gas cap is way cheaper than taking the car to a shop, try this first.  It worked for me, and I got the part in two days. (Amazon Prime)"
1399,1,"LOL!! I love it when bad things happen to bad people.  If you have this on your vehicle, in the flash of an instant you have gone from pure \\""hateration\\"" to celebration!!! Now, I know that's not your intent. You have a few options...1. run out now and remove it. I recommend a mixture of olive oil, soap and water so as not to damage your paint job on your bumper, 2. go to bed now, set your alarm really early, and remove it in the sober light of Wednesday morning, and 3. Join us in supporting our President both on Inauguration Day **1-20-2013** in DC and going forward 4 more years!!!!"
1400,5,"Product met all my expectations, used on shed doors to detour any unwanted entry, product working excellent, need to be covered during winter months to keep moisture out and lock from freezing."
1401,5,"I had previously used a timed brake controller and had to replace my brakes after 10, 000 miles. After that i ordered this pendulum type Prodigy controller. Wow, what a difference. Such a smooth braking action. I hardly know that the RV is behind me know, where before it was a white knuckle job of stopping."
1402,1,Gave this to my wife for Christmas gift. Went to program and it wouldn't register. All the other remotes worked fine. But this one wasn't even putting out a signal when i tested it at auto store. Tried new battery and still no output signal. Called the service number and couldn't understand the lady's foreign accent.
1403,1,The pod does not fit good. The holes for the gauges where not big enough. The holes are drilled off center.And the color does not match. Other than that its great.
1404,4,Great tool for a low price. It arrived quick and was exactly what product description described. I bought it for my husband and he loves it.
1405,5,The person that received this was very satisfied with this item. The quality was very good. The product worked as it should.
1406,1,"Received this gear for a project and didn't fully inspect it until I was ready to install. Unfortunately that was after my time to return, otherwise they would have gotten this piece of c**p back. Terrible pits in several of the teeth, really looked like a used gear! I used my original worn gear as it was in better shape!!<br />Inspect your purchases in a timely manner, just because it says \\""new\\"" don't take their word for it!"
1407,5,Not really sure what could be confusing here.  It works like you'd expect.  Makes pouring form one container to another  easy.  :)
1408,2,"I have a Honda Accord and these wipers were easy to install.  For the first few weeks, the wipers worked well.  However, after a few weeks they streaked terribly even after being cleaned.  I tried Rain-Ex on the windshields to see if the streaking would decrease, but nothing worked.  These wipers are not worth the price."
1409,5,"Very cool sticker, Identical as shown.  I placed mine on wondow but it would be cool If they came with magnetic backing on them for easy removal and mor mounting options"
1410,4,They were not the same quality as OEM. OEM were heavier spiked rubber based. The carpeted side looked exactly like OEM.
1411,5,My new purple bat ears and nose pleased so may people.  I enjoy making people smile with such little effort.
1412,4,"This is fine. It solved the check engine ODB II code in my 2000 Rav4. Why pay for expensive OEM parts? Well, it probably is not as high quality as the Toyota part, and I gave it 4 stars only because it is not OEM, but I know the dealer parts are way overpriced and I refuse to be ripped off by them. Time will tell if the part holds up but really, it seems fine.<br /><br />I cleaned the EGR valve which improved performance (definitely worth doing), I replaced the vacuum modulator which made no noticeable improvement (but could be a problem on your car), and finally this part fixed it. But the vacuum modulator and this switching valve combined came in cheaper here at amazon than buying either one at Advanced Auto, so why not replace both? The VSV is a common problem from what I read, and I spent a lot of time paying attention to symptoms of when the car would run rough or surge. I'm pretty much convinced that this VSV becomes intermittent at a certain temperature just below fully warmed up. So static testing doesn't guarantee it's good. Just go ahead and replace it if doing the easier stuff fails, and you'll probably be successful fixing your car.<br /><br />By the way, this part is very difficulty to replace on a 4WD version of the early Rav4's, but it can be done if you have lots of patience. Search the on-line forums at Rav4World for tips about accessing this poorly placed part. My post is the one from \\""RavingDave\\""."
1413,5,"I'm very satisfied with this product. Fits very well, very godd protection. Recommended by a friend who have a Huyndai Tucson."
1414,5,Make trouble shooting a snap.  a must have for the RV I keep it in my tool box for those on the road surprises.
1415,5,"In my humble opinion, better that original at a price every DIY guy and shade tree mechanic will love.  I will order again from TYC."
1416,4,"Love the lights, but I don't like that they come with additional items that are required to make the bulbs light up. I would like the technology to be integrated to something smaller, and if possible make them regular bulbs."
1417,5,"My Audi (2004 A3) came with heated seats, however, since the day I bought it 5 years ago, the driver side heated seat never functioned. I couldnt take it anymore and had stumbled across these during &#34;Today's deal&#34; and could not resist. I have to tell you though, it took about 5 hours for one seat with the removal and fabrication of the new pad and what not. You may find your install much easier, however, if you have a German made vehicle, expect extreme engineering to un-engineer. Still I highly recommend this product and will buy more in the future for any vehicle I own that does not have heated seats!"
1418,5,"I lost the chuck key for my off brand corded drill and none of the keys for my other drills fit it.  I took a shot in the dark with this key, and sure enough, it fits!  I don't think I'll ever use the magnet, and wish they offered a cheaper version without it, but I'm still very happy with the product.  I definitely recommend it if you've lost your chuck key."
1419,5,I needed to connect my RV with a seven flat in connector to my tow vehicle with a 6 pin round connector. The  product worked great and was offered at a fantastic price.
1420,5,Just what I needed  very fast no wait time great price  better thab I thought  would reccomend to anyone looking
1421,5,i use this every day with a 50 watt solar panel to charge my trailer battery.i would buy more of these if needed.
1422,5,"I removed the white plastic part, must be used in some other vehicle that this fits. I now have a 4-speed fan instead of high only.<br /><br />I've seen these priced as high as $60, so the Amazon price was refreshing."
1423,5,Put one on my 2011 F-150 and 2010 Ford Mustang. Even got a few for friends. Always loved the Decepticons and Cobra from an early age. G I Joe and Autobots suck!
1424,4,"I needed something that would be light and fit in my pocket for a long day on my feet with video equipment. Probably can't get much smaller than this guy if you're in need of small and regular sized philips and flat head screwdrivers. The only downside is that it is too small to really use as much torque as sometimes is required, but it does get the job done."
1425,5,purchased and installed it. serve the purpose and is well build to last. i have purchased this a year ago and it still has not faided much in texas weather... good product
1426,1,"Looks OK but its plastic, i hooked it up and plugged in my Android phone to the usb port, it worked for about 5 seconds and the red light on the usb port went out, i unplugged the phone and apparently the 5 volts no longer works, the 12 volt outlet still works, I'm very unhappy with this, it was a pain to take off my gas tank and run the wires and if i send it back i will have to do this all over again, i simply don't have the time to do all this, if i could get the manufacturer to just send me a new head piece with the socket i could just splice the wires into the harness.<br /><br />I don't see that happening so i rate it one star.<br /><br />buyer beware<br />BTW,the wiring is done correctly, a 6 year old could wire this thing together, i just go a bad product."
1427,5,"I bought this (analog, not digital) gauge at Amazon and I'm very pleased with it.<br />The gauge has a thick rubber protective cuff which protects the dial portion of the unit.<br /><br />The best part of it however is the 0 to 60 psi dial scale. The is the correct scale on a air pressure gauge for standard auto tires. Most auto gauge dials have a pressure scale that is way too high...a lot of them are 0-200 psi. This means the gauge will give very inaccurate readings at tire pressures of 20-40 psi.<br /><br />I suggest you stay away from these high scale gauges if you want to keep your tire pressures within manufacturers specifications which can be pretty tight.<br /><br />A 0-60 psi gauge dial is perfect. Approximately 30 psi is the most accurate area of a 0 to 60 psi gauge.<br /><br />The \\""glow in the dark' feature seems unnecessary. I don't know why I would be checking tire pressure in the dark. But hey, you never know....."
1428,5,I ordered this for my boat galley and it fit perfectly.  I only wish the back of the drain board was little more elevated so all of the water would drain into the sink.
1429,4,The drums were exactly as expected minus the rubberized coating that helps deaden sound.  I haven't seen any like that but on factory new so no big deal.  I just kinda thought since they were Motorcraft that they might have the coating.  Nonetheless they were new and braking is smooth and quiet again.  I figure after my review someone at Amazon might redo the photo so it shows a rear drum instead of a 4 bolt rotor with caliper.
1430,5,Item was an exact match to my missing window switch and works perfectly.  Very happy I went with this vendor.
1431,5,"This is my second set.  They stop good, dust is minimal, and no noise.  However, they are little aggressive on the rotors than the regular pads.  I think that the price you pay for ceramic pads. I think It performs very well and good price to boot."
1432,3,"For my truck, a Chevy k1500, you have to hard wire the lights by cutting off the oem factory plug and wiring the lights up. But you also have to use the old plug for the reverse light. I just cut the factory plug and placed an 1156 bulb in its place for the reverse light. The install instructions were not clear and for too many sets of lights. Overall if you know what you are doing you will be fine. Just don't rely on the manufactures instructions."
1433,4,"I used this wash mop yesterday, and am pleased with the results.<br /><br />As others have stated, the extension pole is flimsy - especially when fully extended - as is the plastic mop head holder.  However, I used it only for reaching the center of the hood, top, front and back windshields.  These areas typically do not get the dirt and mud concentrations that are found on the sides and lower areas of a vehicle.  For these areas, you really do need elbow grease or a sturdier brush.<br /><br />The Carrand microfiber mop is easily detached for cleaning and drying - which I think is a plus.<br /><br />I do recommend this wash mop - but only for lighter duty, which is why I have given it 4 stars rather than 5."
1434,4,Product shipped fast and was just what I ordered. After the install was completed it sounds and performs as expected. Much better than stock and will probably out live my truck.
1435,5,"I bought this pack to bring back the smooth shine on my old car. It works perfectly. I first used it dry, though the treated surface came out smooth, it was only after I used it wet, was there a remarkable difference. I could slightly see a reflection on the coated area and after wiping off the residue, it felt as smooth as a coffee table. I would highly recommend it for both DIY and professional painted surfaces."
1436,5,This product is better than oem. And any plate you can get from an autopart store. I have it on my pontiac g6 and sooooo many people compliment it. For the price. Ide but it again! Very pleased . And pretty quick shipping 5stars
1437,5,"A must need if your running a supercharger and are having flat spots. Car runs faster and clean and smooth up to 8,000 rpms. :)"
1438,5,"My order came earlier than expected which was great! After reading the directions, i was able to install both in a half hour. The quality is top notch and they are very easy to use."
1439,5,"Nothing fancy, but did the job when my taillight went out on my grand cherokee, I had replaced the bulb twice and the socket assembly to no avail, leaving the entire tailight as the culprit. Price wise it was a good deal considering others want 60 for the same part or want to sell both or none, im happy with it"
1440,2,"Put this intake on my 04 Avalanche. Ordered from AutoAnything.com. Great company. Had good discounts at the time of purchase. Fairly quick delivery.<br /><br />As for the intake...It is well built but has issues with installation. I am honestly between 2 and 3 stars...it's ok but I am a bit disappointed.<br /><br />Installation:<br />First, the box is too big. It sits too high and the hood comes down on top of it. It states in the instructions that you can lower the mount that it sits on to make more room for the box but the mount was at the lowest setting. I had to drill a new hole lower to get the mount low enough that the hood doesn't sit on the box. The box needs to be about 1/2 to 1 inch shorter.<br /><br />Second, the tube is too deep on the attachment to the intake. It is a very tight fit behind the fan. Too tight for my comfort. There was about 1/16 of inch clearance...no exaggeration. It was tight. So, I took it back off and cut about 1/4 inch off the back end of the tube to allow for more clearance.<br /><br />Third problem...when I was finishing up and putting the top cover shield on, it has 4 bolts to hold it in place. The front right bolt hole is under the lip from the body of the truck. Can't get the 4th bolt in. Not a big deal as the other 3 will secure the top shield in place fairly well but just shows it is not a perfect fit for this truck. AFE should make the adjustments to this intake so that it fits as it is described and not need mods to get it in. This should have taken about 30 minutes to install but with the mods I had to make to make it fit properly, it took about 1.5-2 hours and still doesn't have the 4th screw on top of the box.<br /><br />As for Performance:<br />It is very quiet under normal conditions, which I like. It definitely sounds more meaty when I open up the RPMs over 2000. It improved the throttle response a little. The Z71 avalanche is a heavy truck and at only 295 HP, not a snappy truck. There was slightly improved throttle response though. As for the gas mileage. No change. I bought this truck in July. Went through 5 tanks prior to installing the intake. I will list my mileage below...<br /><br />Pre installation:<br />tank 1: 12.2 mpg (absolutley no hwy miles on this tank and sat at a lot of lights so it was very poor)<br />tank 2: 15.5 mpg (my normal daily routes for work 40% hwy/60% city)<br />tank 3: 14.8 mpg (normal routes again 40/60 hwy/city)<br />tank 4: 14.4 mpg (normal routes again)<br />tank 5: 15.5 mpg (normal routes)<br /><br />Installed intake<br /><br />Post installation:<br />tank 1: 13.8 mpg (normal routes but I opened it up a bit more intially listening to the sound...)<br />tank 2: 14.8 mpg (normal routes and normal driving conditions)<br />tank 3: 18.2 mpg (pure hwy driving west on I70 from KC to Manhattan, KS...only pure hwy trip I have taken since I bought the truck so no way to compare the hwy mileage)<br />Tank 4: 15.5 mpg (pure hwy driving back from Manhattan...hit rain most of the way and very windy)<br />Tank 5: 14.4 mpg (normal routes again under normal conditions 40% hwy/60% city)<br /><br />As you can see, I have not seen any improvement in mileage since installing the intake. Sounds meatier when opening up the throttle and has a little improved throttle response. Not worth the money in my opinion unless I start seeing an increase in mileage. Even 1 mpg would be great as that is why I bought it. I was hoping to get 16's under my normal daily routes as that would not be much of a drop from my previous vehicle. Next, I plan to put high performance plugs and plug wires in to see if that helps. The truck has 92,000 miles on it and new plugs are part of the 100K mile maintenance anyways. Hope this helps anyone who is debating installing this intake in their trucks.esponse though. As for the gas mileage. No change. I bought this truck in July.

1441,2,"I ordered a deflector for the front of my SUV. Seemed easy enough drop down menu, pick make model and year of vehicle and click order and complete order but when I receieved it, it would not fit. Well that is okay but then you have to be troubled with repacking and getting a return authorization. Why? The total order was crap."
1442,1,These are not as described and will not reflect light the way you'd expect a reflector to do. I had better ones on my old Schwinn bike when I was a kid. Way better. Keep looking.
1443,1,"Either the other guy who wrote up the other Davco wrench was wrong about that not being the wrench in the picture or, there is some funny business going on here! I read that other review so I ordered the opposite wrench. Well, I also got the wrong wrench! This wrench has the elongated slots instead of the small ones. I'll see what Amazon will do about this and report back."
1444,5,"Nothing special, original replacement and works fine on my Grand Cherokee 2002 Limited.<br /><br />Simply unscrew the old parts and screw the new, and now works as it should.<br /><br />If you need buy it, I recommend it."
1445,5,"I had them professionally installed on my 2005 Tacoma. This is not to suggest that installation is difficult, just that I don't have tools and a workplace to adequately do the job. They really look great, do a good job of alerting other drivers that I'm coming up behind them. When parked or waiting I've noticed people (guys) pointing with approval at the lights. I like the way they remain on briefly after I turn the truck off, like courtesy lights. They are a little pricey, but if they last then the price is worth it."
1446,5,I have used this for years on my boat upholstery.  I wipe down the seats and cushions daily in the hot sun. The vinyl on my 2002 boat looks like new still.
1447,5,"i read alot of reviews and did alot of research before i settled on this catback system.  i did not want my 2011 wrangler to sound like a civic.  i must say it sounds much throatier.  it is not an annoying exhaust, its enough to make you enjoy driving a little more.  installation was a breeze.  i never installed an exhaust before so i was a little nervous.  getting the stock one off was the worst part.  i found that using a small pry bar to get the rubber boots off the hangers was my best bet.  putting the new one on only took about a half an hour.  over all i am very pleased with my purchase.  it was cheapest on amazon and i got it in 2 days."
1448,4,"Worth every penny the bluetooth update on the app helped. For what this product does if you have a tablet or phone with the app, you cant go wrong at this price and the torqe app is only $5us"
1449,4,Little large but with that said. I am 39 years old and wear a youth size xl helmet. I would get a second if they made smaller sizes. Maybe this year.
1450,5,This is a good product as if you purchase this at parts store or dealer you will pay 100.00 or so as they try to sell you a kit to relocate vent<br />but if this last a year who cares its a low cost fix and its easy to install.thank you for this offering I have purchased a few of these for different vehicles and have been happy with them all.
1451,2,"I have only had this cover for 10 months and the top layer is already deteriating from the sun. When I take the cover off of my jeep, it is coverd with the top layer of fabric. The good thing is that it fits nicely.Not worth the money."

1454,3,"bought this to pump the gas out of my blown engine car, it is really not that hard to get the pumping actions started like other reviewers claimed, however the poor design for the connection between the brass fitting and the poly tube, I got my brass fitting stuck and dropped inside my fuel tank, so I still need to take my fuel tank down."
1455,5,"Restore Black is a special type of paint that sticks to surfaces really well.  What's nice is that it's meant to stick to plastic and slide off the paint job.  The applicator provided is only good for tires, so use it for that purpose and that purpose only.  Go to the dollar store and get foam brushes.  A pack is enough, but you might want to use something fine like cotton swabs and use them carefully to get the fine spots.  Although people mention that the paint comes off the paint job, it's really hard to get off without scrubbing it with a towel and if you use scouring pads you'll have to clearcoat the area and on an older car it doesn't look that great, so PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, use painter's blue tape at all surfaces because it's a messy job.  That said, do not apply this without the tape absolutely on Matte paint because you'll certainly ruin it.  Gloves are optional, since the paint comes off with the scouring pads.  Because of that little issue of not being a true kit, I would give Restore Black and any similar product like vinyl spray 4.5 stars.<br /><br />The end result is beautiful and supposed to last about 6 months, wipe the area sparingly because any abrasion may ruin the job.  That said, I'd stay away from automatic car washes, unless they use the rollers because the pressure in touchless washes is strong.  As a bonus, this compound sticks to metal surfaces if they are small, such as wiper blade arms. Dab it, let it dry, dab it, let it dry the same way you would do it to a wound but do not brush it until you get several coats.  Still not as good as a good spray paint, but the job gets done."
1456,5,"Use this 16\\"" product vs. the 14\\"" one for your Prius, as it provides better coverage and is the same size as the factory installed one. Video instruction on the web combined with instructions with new product may help you swap out the old with this new product in less than a minute. Price is lowest found and replacing the entire blade assembly vs. just the rubber blade is a big time saver. Delivery was faster than expected. I ordered two to have a spare for the future and cut shipping cost about in half for each one,"
1457,4,"Nice decal,will use vendor again.Good commucation between vendor and customer.Had quick email response when i needed a guestion answered.Was answered to my satisfaction."
1458,2,"This is the second emgo mirror i've used over the years. The quality is very mediocre, and in no way comparable to the original honda part. The rubber decays after a couple of years, with cracks quickly forming, and even when new does not grip on to the base plate, so the metal at the base of the stalk remains visible. The mirror itself does not have the same field of view/curvature as the original. About the only good thing that can be said about it is that the bolt pattern matches the original, so it mounts easily."
1459,5,"Installed in minutes, easy to use, great price, always find what I need on Amazon and their shipping is excellent.  Never been disappoint in anything I have bought from them.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0984131612 Ramen Recipes]]<br />[[ASIN:0984131604 Foreman Style or Panini Grill Cooking]]"
1460,3,As i selected the product was ok.  The problem with this product is the fact that the edges are very fragile.  The manufacturers need to look at sealing the inside spaces around the edges.  When the prduct came there were pieces broken off that indicates the edgees are very fragile.  I had compared it with the original ligt and realized a complete difference in the regidity of the edges.  Otherwise the product is ok.
1461,4,"Have owned this bag for nearly six months and have travelled with it in all kinds of weather, including rain and snow storms. I can attest that it is truly water proof - both to the outside elements and to liquid spills from within.  I was skeptical about the nylon straps and plastic claps, but they have held the bag firmly in place and never loosened during travel.  I have found only two drawbacks: (1) the bag's material becomes hard and brittle in cold weather, which I believe contributed to one of the straps tearing off the bag on my first trip with it; (2) the zipper only opens two sides of the bag making loading and unloading very awkward at times.  Overall, the bag has met expectations and I would consider re-purchasing it."
1462,5,"not much to add that hasn't been said, but this did work well to find coolant leaks on my '01 Regal (was the plastic coolant elbows by alternator) and on my '93 Ford work van (just a loose hose clamp)  So it easily paid for itself in saved mechanic costs already.  Recommend having one on hand for the shade tree mechanics like me.<br /><br />Also used it to test the radiator caps on both these vehicles, since I now could.  :)"
1463,5,"I installed a battery tender connection last year on my wife's Vulcan 900 so I could connect it to the battery tender.  This unit just plugs into the tender and we wired it under her tank and right into her windshield bag. Now she can plug in her GPS or her I phone and tuck the cord in her windshield bag.. Took 5 minutes..  This unit works awesome, has a rubber cap to seal it when its not used."
1464,5,"I love this product.  It looks great on my car.  I am very pleased with this item. It shipped fast, and easy to install."
1465,4,"This product is good for the money you are spending. I would like to say that the actual cross bars are high grade plastic, but none the less,they work great. I plan on using it for a car topper/cargo carrier and it fit great on the bars. It was very easy to install and took about a half hour. The pakcage came in about four business days (from California to Colorado)."
1466,5,"This tach/hour meter is great for some things. However, it updates every second, so don't expect the tach to keep up with varying engine rpm. It's best for setting maximum rpm on things with a governor, like a log splitter, snow blower, etc., or setting an idle rpm. Also, the user manual is/was wrong. It might be correct now. The correct rpm settings are:<br /><br />01 - Every other revolution<br />02 - Every revolution<br />03 - Multi firing ignition (twice per revolution)<br /><br />You might be surprised that several small 4 stroke engines fire on every revolution. This is usually called a \\""waste spark.\\"" It's not needed but it's cheaper to make an engine that fires on every revolution. So on several small 4 stroke engines, 02 is the correct setting.<br /><br />The hour meter is an OK feature but that's not why I bought it."
1467,5,"I placed the carrier on top of our SUV then shoved 5 giant suitcases (one stacked on top of the other), a cooler and a carry-on duffel bag into the carrier.  Then I followed the directions and cinched it down.  We drove 1800 miles, up to 85 mph, sometimes in the rain, and the product performed flawlessly.  I was very pleased.

1469,1,"My 2008 Subaru Outback has frameless doors around the glass window areas.  Therefore, I had to stick these wind/rain guards directly onto the car body, above the doors.  Problem is, when you open the doors, the glass windows hit the guards and you can't open the door with the windows all the way up.  Yes, I did try to mount the guards even higher, but then it looks pretty stupid and they become ineffective at doing their job (keeping wind and rain out) because they are mounted so far above the window line!<br /><br />If your car does not have a frame around the whole door, including over the window area, these just suck for looks, functionality and effectiveness.  VERY disappointed.  Now, I am having a problem returning them as the seller says no refunds after 30 days.  It took me a month before I could get around to installing them.  We've had so much rain lately and I work full time!"
1470,2,"When I connected the compression tester to the extension, it leaked at the male/female connection even with a new \\""O\\"" ring and screwed in as tight as I could get it. Checked compression without the extension and it was 20 PSI higher than with the extension. Finally I expoxyed the male end of the tester to the female end of the extension. Now it works fine. I have three testers, so I sacrificed one to be permanently attached to the extension."

1473,5,"I recently hit a deer and had to replace my passenger side power mirror. i priced them through part stores and etc. and was shocked when i found this one for this price. i was very scared that i was taking a risk and that i would waste money on something that wouldn't work or look right. i was beyond relieved. came fairly fast. my brother, a mechanic, was able to put it on fairly quickly, it looks just like the other original factory mirror on the other side, works great and cost me 1/3 of the other prices i got. :-)"
1474,5,"I've been running these for 2 months now on my wife's 2004 Accord without any hiccups. Installation was a mixed bag--of course, this isn't any fault of the product, but the idiotically designed bulb locations in this generation of Accords (idiotic, compared the much simpler design of the 07+ Camry). The instructions that were included with the kit could be a little clearer, but the drawings are enough to figure out what goes where. You may have to switch the \\""direction\\"" of the pins if the unit doesn't light up. I'm purchasing a 2nd set for an older car."
1475,5,This is a great product. It looks as good as it functions. I would use this product on all of my vehicles.
1476,4,"PROS (Plus 4 Stars):<br /> - Looks great<br /> - Snaps on, installed in seconds.<br /> - chrome plating matches existing grille chrome perfectly.<br /><br />CONS (Minus 1 Star):<br /> - No easy way to uninstall the grille cover.

1477,1,"Never got the online update to work. Tech support said it was my network or firewall. Tried on 3 different computers, networks with no success. This may have been a small issue, but their help desk was of no help at all. With their limited service hours it was always closed at 2pm local time - so if you're working on your vehicle after your work day, forget it. Since the instructions said to update it before using it for the first time, and I couldn't get it to link up, I had to return it for a refund."
1478,5,"I purchased this wheel cover in black leather last year.  I have been using it for quite some time and I find it to be a wonderful product!  It does not require much effort to put onto the wheel.  Once on the wheel, it doesn't slip or move.  It also cools more quickly than the actual wheel, which is good if you live in a warm and sunny place."
1479,1,"The price is for a brake hose with proportioning valve. Yet when they ship there was no proportioning valve, but i was charged for it.<br /><br />Tehey sent a replacement, but with thr same result, no proportioning valve, again, only the rubber hose was shipped in the box."
1480,1,"I bought mounts for my Lexus 2004 IS300 with 90,000 miles and they were unacceptable from the first minute.  They are TRASH.  Look at the pictures I provided and judge by its appearance.  The car became an unbelievable rattle trap.  Aside from the vibration it created, a harmonic rumble at idle was created and that was hard on the ears.  I spent two weeks with my mechanic dealing with this.  Here's the bottom line:  These mounts were bad the second they were installed.  I had to pay the labor to install and then re-install back to my old original parts.  My mechanic spent about 6 hours trying to figure what was going on with these mounts.  I took the risk on these mounts and lost big time, the mechanic lost on his diagnostic hours, and in the end I'll get a refund and an apology from the seller."
1481,5,"These quick discos are exactly what I needed for the average trail riding I do. They are extremely handy, and so much better than the stock bolt. They do not compromise on road stability, and I'd recommend them for anyone."
1482,5,These work better than the brass screens and they are easy to clean. I recommend it for these pipes. I hadnt had no clogs yet and the smoke feels cleaner.
1483,2,"I purchased the Rock Tamers Mud Flaps for our 2004 Chevy 2500 truck to keep the rocks off of our new horse trailer.  I ended up cutting the flaps 3 times due to them throwing rocks when the trailer is under load because the flaps kept dragging on our gravel roads.  However, with the trailer empty, the flaps are too high and rocks fly from the tires and hit the trailer.  So there is no happy middle ground.  Also, the attachment system needs to be removed each time you change out the reciever hitch as it mounts directly to the removable receiver and not to the truck hitch itself.  This requires loosening bolts and re-tightening after switching out hitches.  I have since switched to a 3-in-1 ball so I do not have to remove the reciever portion."
1484,1,I bought this to reduce the electrical ticking from the ignition on my motorcycle which uses a J&M radio system and it had no effect at all. I then tried it on my 2.1 computer speakers in my home that emit a loud static hiss and again it had no effect. Mine was either defective or ineffective for my situations so I returned it. They did refund my money minus the return shipping. Try at your own risk.
1485,5,"If you're trying to remove big, old philips head screws - such as the door striker plate in an old car - just buy this tool and don't look back. It works - end of discussion!<br /><br />Using this tool is very simple. Here's what I did to break loose the screws in a 35+ year old door striker plate:<br /><br />1. Use the biggest philips bit that will fit snugly into your philips head screw.<br />2. Get a large hammer, preferably a small sledge or big heavy claw hammer<br />3. Use a pencil to lightly mark the the screw head with the surrounding material (so you can see when you start making progress)<br />4. Insert the tool into philips head screw and TURN IT THE DIRECTION YOU WANT IT TO GO - it will only move a little, maybe 10-deg or so rotation<br />5. Hold the tool firmly and give it a good solid whack with your hammer (yes, it will bounce out of the screw head - this is normal)<br />6. Check your mark to see if the screw moved (it feels great to finally see progress!)<br />7. Repeat until the screw has rotated about 45-deg (1/8 turn)<br />8. Using the TOOL, see if you can turn the screw BY HAND<br />9. If you can't turn it yet, repeat steps 4-8 until you can back out the screw by hand<br /><br />I'm sure it works for other purposes, but this one use was enough to justify the purchase for me."
1486,5,"Pretty happy with this compressor so far. Have only had it a short time. Will air up a 235/75/15 tire on my Jeep ZJ from zero to 30 pounds in a little over 30 seconds. On my Suburban K2500, it will air up a 305/70/16 from 22 to 50 pounds in 2.5 minutes. Best speed of any 12 volt compressor I have seen. Definitely not as fast as my CO2 bottle but a lot better than my old 12V compressor. It took about 2 days to fill up the Jeep tire. This one comes with a short run of rubber hose that connects to the compressor, between it and the plastic coiled hose. This rubber hose gets very hot and I wonder how long it will last, probably should have been a length of steel braided hose instead. Have not had it to the beach yet to see how it handles airing up 4 tires on the Suburban but suspect it will do fine. Looks to be quality construction, not cheapo looking. Comes with a handy carrying case that holds the compressor & hoses easily. I will probably add a coil of copper tubing at the discharge to act as an after-cooler so the hoses don't get subjected to so much heat. The cylinder itself barely got warm, just the discharge hose got hot. I also like the black finish as this tends to reject heat better than other colors, especially the chrome plated ones. Definitely worth the money in my opinion."
1487,1,Recons light didn't work with my 2007 F-150. I bought this Recon light bar from Never Enough Auto through Amazon. Everthing worked except the running light. I had to pay to ship it back and NEA sent a replacement. It didn't work. NEA said call Recon. Recon said you need resistors to make it work. I wish they had said that in the beginning. It would have saved some drama since it was a Christmas present and advertised as the only thing you need to do is plug it into your 4 pin plug with NO INFO IN THE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ABOUT RESISTORS. I had to send the replacement back to NEA to get a refund and they wanted me to pay another shipping charge. They did eventually send me a free return shipping label. NEA said the Recon was junk and suggested a Rampage which they said had been redesigned. I said the Recon had better reviews on Amazon. I emailed Rampage and per Jake their light has been redesigned. So if you have a late model Ford try a Rampage. Stay away from the Recon. I ended up buying a PUTCO at a local shop. It was plug in and go. Looks good and works good so far. con-sidering all the pros and the cons don't get Re-con(ed) like I did:)
1488,5,"I was impressed in the way this light works, its doesn't actually have a different bulb for the high beams, it actually moves the light bulb back to get it to be a high beam. I was skeptical when i first saw this but am proud to say they work excellent! I did have one issue with a bulb and emailed the seller and they were quick to respond and replace the item. This is the third time buying from this seller and I will continue to get lights from this seller!"
1489,5,"After reading several reviews on the HD Forums I decided to try the Redline in my transmission of my 05'Harley Fatboy CVO<br />What a difference, I used to have a loud clank , Not no more... Highly recommend it"
1490,1,"Might be a good flashlight, but a it's a poor spotlight. Received one as a gift, charged it according to instructions and the light was powerful when used in short spans of time, unfortunately the first time I used it as a spotlight to guide my boat, it went dim after about 5 minutes and was useless. Charged several more times with the same results. Contacted Rally was advised needed receipt which being a gift I didn't have, also the unit needs to be returned prepaid which doesn't make it economically feasible."
1491,5,"I have 2010 BMW X5, all the windshield was scratched, nobody was able to fix it up until I found product, i works perfectly, all the scratches were gone ( 80-90%) , you just have to be extra patient working this product, read the manual it comes with follow the instructions you'll get the job done, unless your scratches super deep,in this case it won't help,good luck."
1492,5,They fit purfect and were easy to install. Adjustments to spray direction could not have been easier. Just a small awl and the spray was hitting just where I wanted it.
1493,5,It was quick and easy to replace the autoride compressor on my 2005 LT suburban.  my old pump had blown out because of bad bladders on the air ride shocks - this compressor has returned my auto leveling to what it should be.
1494,5,REceived this item on time and in excellent conditions.  I recommend to order using Amazon.  I need other accesories and looking if these item will order by Amazon.
1495,5,"Bought these to stake down our new trampoline after losing our previous trampoline in a windstorm.  Haven't had any winds yet so can't say how well they work, but they are very sturdy and seem like they would do the trick.  Put one on all 4 sides of the trampoline so we staked the eye hook in the ground, attached the metal cable with the included fasteners, wrapped it around the bar of the trampoline, and attached again to the same eye hook.  There was plenty of metal cable included but you will definitely need bolt cutters to cut it to the length you need."
1496,5,"For many years we have have been pleased with Aqua-Kem toilet freshener in our camper.  As usual, the Aqua-Kem arrived on time in excellent condition."
1497,5,I did not use this product as it was intended.  It is for use on an ATV but instead I mounted it onto the tongue of my utility trailer to allow me to carry my gas cans in it rather than inside my trailer.  Not only does it allow me easy access to fill up my tanks at the gas station but it keeps any gas fumes from stinking up the inside of my enclosed cargo trailer.  I tried to find a basket or box which was designed for this use on my trailer but they were all too small and very expensive.  Using this product worked great.
1498,4,"Wow, where do I begin with this review. I bought the solar panel back in December of last year and finally got it going in May of this year.  The solar panel is well built and seems to be high quality. I used a voltmeter and tested it in full sunlight and indiurect light, and it performs as stated. I never used the mounting brackets, as I mounted it to the wall of my shed with a ground mount.  My solar panel charges a 108 amp hour AGM battery, and took about two days of sunlight to charge it fully. I use a Sunforce 30 amp charge controller that I bought from Amazon, and run a 600 watt pure sine wave Xantrex inverter off of the battery.  If you are like me and are wanting to use solar power for a shed, a lot of research will pay huge dividends. You should research how much power you need and then caculate the total costs. I had a lot of convicing to do with the wife. I really underestimated my needs, and thus it tok a long time and more money to get it done. If you are using this panel to recharge batteries, it is great. But if you intend to use it in a stand alone configuration. you need to put in alot of thought.  To avoid beating around the bush, here is my total setup.   I have the 80 watt solar panel connected to my shed wall. I went to Lowes and bought 10 AWG wire to run from the panel to a panel disconnect. I am using a 10 amp breaker in an Midnite Baby box. From there, the 10 AWG wire runs into the charge controller. I am using 10 AWG wire from the controller to the battery. For my battery to inverter connection, I am using 2/0 AWG inverter cables with a 250 amp inline fuse(probably overkill). I drove an 8 foot copper grounding rod and am running 6 AWG copper wire to groung my panel and inverter(use seperate runs of wire for this). So far all is good, and I have not encountered any performance or safety issues. My inverter is able to allow me to charge my portable tool batteries and run my 14 watt shed lamp. Is it enough power for all of my power tools? No. But it will supplement and do in emergencies and I can save some money for recharging power tool batteries and running small items.  Hope this review helps someone out there."
1499,3,very good product for the money...cheeep! install and instructions wasnt too bad either. wished they had park lamps though.shipping was quick and free.
1500,3,"I gave these away as a gift after getting them , they were plastic and seemed a little cheap for harley I got some ones that looked like the devil after"
1501,2,"I got this gloves to ride in the colder months. In 2 weeks of riding, I used this gloves in 3 or 4 trips of around 100 miles, and in one of gloves the cuff leather is tearing apart. Also when riding around 50 degrees my fingers were freezing after 30 mins, they are not warm at all."
1502,4,"I like the jacket.  It keeps the cold out the leather smells great.  I have two (2) problems with it: 1) The zippers stick; 2) the belt doesn't have enough holes to make it tight enough.<br /><br />I fixed the sticking, somewhat, by rubbing bar soap in the teeth and I \\""fixed\\"" the belt by shortening it in the back.  The zipper tabs also cause me concern.  They seem too light.  When they get crossways the zipper won't work and I'm afraid they'll break trying to get them re-aligned.<br /><br />--- Review Update ---<br />After using this item a while (two months) I have appreciated it more.  The zippers have not broken and no longer stick, it's warm and keeps the wind out, and it still has a great leather smell. -- I am giving it an additional star."
1503,4,"The part was correct for my vehicle, installed & fit perfectly. Awesome deal, over a hundred bucks cheaper than the auto-parts store. The packaging looked like it had been kicked around in the bottom of a freighter for months, but the part was fine!"
1504,5,After  changing  to new plugs ( 94000km)  the fuel  economy on my wife car  went from  350 km/tank  to 450/ tank ( city driving ) .  Worth changing over to save  money on  just one  fill up .  One more thing  performance  didn't really change that much with  the new plugs .
1505,5,"This product looks great, has held up longer than Sylvania Silverstar version and are cheaper than Silverstar bulbs.    I will be buying these again, unfortunately the price for the product has gone up.  Was $16.80 and now it is up to $21.00."
1506,4,"Sprays well, good distance. Haven't used it on anyone yet but just glad my wife and daughter have one. I think just by getting it out and showing the bad guys what you have should deter a situation, if not, SPRAY IT! keep in mind in Calif. your only allowed 2.5OZ size or smaller.(what a load of $#@%*!!!)"
1507,5,This kind of tool is a must especially on tight space like newer car has very limited space that some other oil filter remover won't fit.
1508,3,I Loved the item but i wasnt too thrilled with the shipper... It came 2 days behind scheduled. It looks really good.
1509,5,Fast shipment and a nice product.. this is a good choice to replace the cheap plastic dealership advertising. It shines real nice.
1510,5,"Really strong and nice looking keychain for any Soul Eater fan. Looks great on keys, backpacks, and just about anything."
1511,5,"Very nice to install, It was uased for a 1986 dodge ramcharger. Would recomend that you get the ball and insert for this. It dosen't come withit. Only took 20 min. to install, It came with a spring tool to help with the bolt insertion. worked great.."
1512,5,Mobil 1 is great oil from the cars that I have used it in MB C280 with 410K - Motor ran great but car was killed by a stupid deer! Used this oil in  my e39 BMW and since it is Euro Speced for the BMW not readily available in my area. Nice to get it delivered to my front door quickly and at a great price to boot! Amazon experience has been real good so far
1513,5,"2009 Mini Cooper non-turbo. Replaced pads, rotors, and sensors: everything went it fine. Put a set of OZ Ultraleggera's on at the same time, so not only did I get better brakes, but more rubber to stop with. Initial bedding was easy. Wife has to be careful now because hitting the brakes too hard is like running into a wall."
1514,5,I installed these headlights and passing lights on my Electra Glide just as shown in the picture and they increased the visibility very much over the standard halogen lights.  Motorcycle riders know seeing and being seen are very important and making sure the stupid drivers see you can keep you alive.  These lights are the same as are used in Iraq and Afghanistan for the military vehicles. Very rugged and long lasting. The installation is plug and play and replaces the original equipment exactly. Nothing else to buy. Outstanding!
1515,5,"This is actually a Grayline 322 (aka 40322).  This is a heavy duty sink protector rack that sits on four protrusions from the rack.  It is strong and stable.  I've been looking all over for one of these to replace the one that has been in our sink for ~10 years.  By comparison, all the other similar products are thin and poorly made.  Nobody else seems to carry it; I did a lot of searching.  Now that \\""Panacea Products\\"" has purchased Grayline, we'll see if they continue to produce it.  One can hope, but there's no sign of it, or any other Grayline product, on their website."
1516,4,"Gloves are excellent quality. Will be great for cooler weather riding. Very comfortable and no problems using my controls on my bike.  I will say they are stiffer than what I would like,but for the price they are still ok."
1517,5,It is what it is but what more can you ask for lol. Quality vinyl quick shipping look here for whatever you need decal wise.
1518,1,"WE ENDED UP RETURNING THE RACK AFTER IT'S FIRST USE BECAUSE WE COULDN'T JUSTIFY SPENDING NEARLY $400.00 ON A PRODUCT THAT SOLVED ONE PROBLEM BUT CREATED SEVERAL OTHERS.  I have to say that this product is very well made and it seemed like a slick way to mount your bikes to your pop-up.  The trouble began when I found that the back bike wheels slide ALL OVER THE PLACE.  So to remedy this they supply many useless webbing straps with flimsy plastic pull trough buckles.  These straps are not pictured in the photo advertisement, for good reason because if you saw the amount of straps necessary you would realize the MAJOR hassle this strapping job is and you'd NEVER pay, nearly, $400 for this rack.  Luckily I work in a strap intensive industry--I'll leave that to your imagination--and therefore have lots of the best straps money can buy (and trust me they are nothing like the cheap ones supplied by pro-rac).  So after using about 7 INDUSTRIAL straps we were on our way.  Of course this didn't stop the bikes from sliding around a bit and freaking me out both ways on our 300 mile trip.  WE ENDED UP RETURNING THE RACK AFTER IT'S FIRST USE BECAUSE WE COULDN'T JUSTIFY SPENDING NEARLY $400.00 ON A PRODUCT THAT SOLVED ONE PROBLEM BUT CREATED SEVERAL OTHERS."
1519,5,"This weather top is exactly as advertised. It keeps out all weather and keeps a topless Jeep cool on those hot summer days in the parking lot. It takes about 3 minutes to put on and is very easy. Taking it off is a little more difficult if you want to keep it folded and ready for the next time you need it, but still only takes about 4 minutes.<br /><br />I'd recommend it to a friend without reservation."
1520,4,I was pleasantly surprised that the image on these look better than the picture. They are heavy high quality rubber. My son loves them in his truck!
1521,5,"Based on other's reviews, I ordered this to figure out why the \\""Service Engine Soon\\"" light was illuminated on my Taurus. This unit allowed me to get the code and fix the problem without any additional expense. The code was P0401 \\""insufficient EGR flow.\\""<br /><br />The fix involved cleaning the passages in the throttle body intake so that the EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) system would work properly. Carbon buildup had blocked this system. Once this was done, the light went out and the car passed inspection."
1522,4,"Yes, this product helps to prevent overheating of your car. But it's difficult to adjust it near the wind shield. Because there are no vacuum cups. You should try to use your own brain, it's like a puzzle :)"
1523,4,"The mats are pretty good. I was sent the wrong sub model so it doesn't fit exact but no biggie, they work as advertised and work well. After being in now for a few months, they are holding up good. The sides tend to bend inwards a little, leaving a gap for debris to fall into. The are super durable and fairly easy to clean. Would buy again.  ***6 month update***  I recently traded the car in and upon removing the mats was amazed to see the floor looked brand new. I put back in the factory mats which were still new as well and got a great trade in value, condition wise. I plan on buying a set for the new car as well. Must have!!"
1524,1,"I was excited to purchase this hitch basket a few months ago, and thrilled that it was eligible for Prime shipping. When the basket arrived, it was HUGE- even bigger than I expected, but almost exactly as wide as my Jeep, which was perfect. I put the basket together- the basket itself comes in two parts which attach to the center \\""yoke\\"". This particular basket would not quite fit properly. only one of the two \\""Valley\\"" plates included in the packaging, which are designed to not only add branding and appearance, but also to assist in holding the two basket sections together would fit. The other would not fit because the two frame pieces would not fit together completely flush. I figured that this was a minor problem, and not worth returning- there were several bolts and another plate holding the basket together- it seemed sturdy. Plus, shipping this thing back would have been an absolute nightmare due to its size and weight, I'm not sure it would even fit in my car.   So now, about 3 months after my purchase arrived, I am attempting to use it for the first time. I don't have a regular need for hauling items. I was extremely disappointed to find out that the hitch/yoke is so poorly manufactured that it will not work properly with my 2\\"" hitch receiver. The hitch slides easily into the receiver, but then the pin absolutely WILL NOT go all the way through to properly secure the basket to the trailer hitch. It seems that the holes on this product were drilled unevenly and they do not match up w/ my receiver. This is a problem w/ the basket, as I have used other items with the receiver hitch without incident. Not only will the pin not fit through, but the basket sits very much at a slant, so that even if I could secure it to the vehicle, any cargo would slant and slide to one side.    The workmanship on this product is absolutely terrible. The pieces do not fit together properly, and the holes are drilled so poorly that it is unusable with a receiver hitch. I now have a $100+ piece of scrap metal that is completely unusable (it is unsafe to use if it cannot be secured to the hitch), and too large to do anything else with. Thanks Valley for having absolutely no quality control, and thanks Amazon for not checking the product out before shipping."
1525,1,"Amazon's quick shipping and easy return process was great, but I'd avoid purchasing from this manufacturer. It didn't work. No power in the \\""warm\\"" and \\""cool\\"" modes, and in \\""off\\"" it lit red for warming but didn't really warm up (and what I want it for is its cooling function for a move and summer travels in 3 wks). Apparently, in order to compete in price, they cut basic common-sense corners and don't actually bother taking 2 seconds to flick the switch on their electronic products to test if they actually work before selling and shipping them. Which would be the easy and right thing to do. In order to make and sell as many of these as they can, as cheaply as they can, they forgo this basic step and let you blow a week ordering and waiting and, after it arrives defective, blow 2-3 weeks unpacking it, testing it, filling out and printing a return form, repackaging it, then waiting weeks for a refund to show up in your bank account while you have to concurrently order another product, or wait for a dubious replacement of this one. Such is the ethics of mass-production and price competition, minus quality control. Two seconds to pay an underpaid soul to flick the switch and see if it actually works after it's manufactured is, apparently, more of a hit to the company's profit-margin than they're willing to take."
1526,5,This stuff is the best. i have used it in several different trucks and the results have been great in every truck. it will make a trans with 150k miles feel alot tighter and shift much better.
1527,5,"Excellent quality.  This replaced another t-bolt clamp that sheered off.  This particular clamp worked perfect on a 2.5\\"" exhaust pipe."
1528,3,"If you are really handy with cars and doing electrical work, this remote starter is a great value. I purchased two, one for each car.  Pros: Good price, Instructions are good but complex - they need to be, this is not just plug-and play installation.  Cons: FORGET about 'service', no such thing. I called their 'support' number on many occasions, not a single time did anyone answer. No answers to email attempts either. (Reason for my call: one of the units has a VERY limited range - about 25', whereas the other is much better, like 75')"
1529,4,"One of the factory sway bar connectors broke on my factory 2004 Rubicon and I bought these to replace them. I wasn't sure if the Rubicon had a longer connector than the other Wrangler models which is why I chose this 0-2 inch lift. But, I don't think there is a difference after installing these. I like they are made in USA. They did not come with any instructions and were completely disassembled, so I used the picture above to piece them together. They work great so far. I am concerned that the disconnect pin is eventually going to be pushed out due to the design, because as the poly bushing wears out I think the part will push against the pin. But, it has not happenned in the two weeks since I installed them. These are about an inch and a half longer than the factory connectors, but it does not seem to matter, my jeep rides great again. I would recommend this part as a replacement. They are very solid and the parts are well made."
1530,5,"Decided to put an end to experimenting with other units that<br />provide little or no feedback as to charge or process. Shelled out<br />a bit more than I'd planned but now have a unit on a shelf over<br />my car (long leads) that displays the status when I enter the<br />garage some 25' away. After cycling for a week, the batt; is<br />now topped - if it's getting a little dose now and then I have<br />not observed. The directions weren't totally clear but you'll<br />figure it out. Bought on popularity, keeping on performance,<br />recommending to others. My scarcely driven 911 Carrera<br />agrees. BTW, the spec'd batt. barely fits the cavity - with<br />this unit you can step down one size, save weight, get the<br />batt. in (blocking it well to prevent shifting) and still have<br />plenty of juice to start her right up. Now, have I tested the<br />operation with a voltmeter, no.<br />UPDATE 1 Year later<br />Unit operating as above, no complaints. It cycles through<br />its charging steps periodically, the lights change color,<br />the battery is always topped up.<br />UPDATE 3 Years in - hasn't skipped a beat.

1531,5,"It was fairly easy to install, I just put a jack stand under my drivers side   rear tire, and was able to pull out my fuel tank. anyone with a basic knowledge  of cars should be able to do this repair themselves. no special tools were required,  At least on a (2000 ls chevy blazer 4.3L vortec)"
1532,1,The picture shows it to be much larger than it appeared to be. It was to small for what I intended to use it for.
1533,5,"Much better than the previous bags I had. It has a hard inside shell to keep it from becoming droopy and flaccid. High quality threading and a has a great detachable feature! Overall, it looks classy and I recommend these bags. Great for the price!"
1534,5,"With close to 100K miles on my 2000 f-150 (4.6L) I started shopping for parts.  The sypmtoms were slow start,declining fuel economy, and a dash-light.  I had one coil go out at 80K miles and the technician told me they occasionally go bad early, but I should plan on changing the rest at 100K along with the plugs.  I called MSD to ask if any controllers, etc were also needed - no, just the coils.  It took me 5 hours to de-grease the engine and change the plugs/coils.  We had record low temps the next two weeks in Texas ***the truck cold started within the first rotation in 17 degree weather with these new parts (it took at least 2 rotations to start in 70 degree weather prior to parts)***  I've had the truck for 10 years & it now starts faster and idles smoother than when new.  Idle was at 750 rpm, now it's 600 and much smoother.  Increase in economy and performance? I don't have numbers but have all the proof I need to say: Better than OEM!              Two weeks later I had Firestone flush and change the radiator hoses and do a transmisson service with filter.  I saved $200+ by doing the plugs/coils myself based on their quote (quote included new plugs and replace the coil BOOTS, not the coils themselves)!    I have all the respect for my Firestone shop and their Tech's (who have told me that MSD is the only brand they would pay a premium over OEM) but Firestone (a franchise) won't install customer supplied parts.  Last night I replaced the EGR valve myself (purchased from local source since they told me the error code at no cost) and cleaned the throttle body ports from EGR side dash-light FIXED.  I saved $200 plus $80 diagnostic fee on this 45 minute job!      Between Amazon and DIY I've saved enough to pay for Firestone's cooling and transmission services.  Next, I'll save $90 by replacing the passenger door electric lock actuator I got through Amazon.      [[ASIN:B000ZIZHKK MSD 82428 Blaster Coil-on-Plug]]"
1535,5,"Shipping was incredibly quick, and included instructions on how to program the new remote(which actually worked the first time). My old remote was completely worn out and to find one at a great price with such good service was a plus. If I need any keyless remotes in the future, I know exactly where to get it from."
1536,2,"The printed index on the outside of the tube is so faint, that it will probably wear off in a month, making the tool useless. Other than that, very nice."

1538,5,"This does what is described. We like the stock look. We had it professionally installed and their only complaint was that the wires that ran between the camera and the mirror were too short. The truck is a Chevy extended cab standard bed Silverado.  They never heard of the product before, but they liked that the temperature and compass was in the mirror. Overall we give it a thumbs up."
1539,5,"This is my second Snatch-um Strap. The first lasted for years and pulled out many vehicles, even some buried to the frame in sand. It is a must-have for off-roaders."
1540,3,"This is a well made scanner. The screen is very readable and contrast is adjustable. The steps to read codes are easy and when it works it works very well.

1541,4,"This is a awesome clutch kit for the price but its defiantly not a performance clutch. I bought mine less then 6 months ago and already burned it out. Now i don't blame exedy for this but me. I was playing in the snow and doing clutch kicks, also i eventfully got stuck a few times.    But over all a great clutch for the money for everyday driving."
1542,5,If you have to do some effective job then I recommend this in a heart beat. Buy this and you will never regret. Good luck with your project.
1543,5,"heheh, I'm going to be the outlier here - believe it or not I use this in my car!  :)  I think this really shows the power and versatility of this battery.  I modified the back of my car to open up to allow for easier working on the engine, but this required me to tilt the trunk 90 degrees - the original battery was a normal battery, so this would translate to spilling it's contents all over everything, which is generally what you don't want to do.  So I searched around and looked for what my options were in terms of a sealed battery that could still put out enough amps to turn over my car more than a few times and not leave me stranded in some parking lot.  A couple other Lotus owners also identified this battery (which they used for weight reasons), and I switch to it about two years ago - without a single issues.    Now I don't recommend this for everyone (or really anyone), because there are quite a few caveats - such as I had to put a battery quick-disconnect on it because the parasitic load from the alarm would drain it dead in about a week.  But I think the fact that I can use the battery and have it perform so well in an environment it most likely was not intended to be in speaks volumes of its quality."
1544,5,GREAT BUY FOR THE PRICE JUST WHAT I NEEDED IAM GOING TO ORDER ONE MORE TO USE AS A SPARE
1545,4,This product was given as a gift to our Son's Family.  They love travel and camping and this is a good fit.
1546,1,"Nothing would get cold and it will kill your battery if you leave it plugged up with the engine off! Bad buy, would not recommend to anyone. And item is horribly made as well!"
1547,5,"I bought this muffler to replace rusted out muffler on my 98 4Runner. Excellent choice oem sound-ver quiet. I was going to DIY but decided to pay a shop to do it, one hour later, no more rumbling under the truck- back to normal. Very happy with this Walker muffler."
1548,5,"These decals were adorable, but for a van, they are quite small. Looks better on a smaller car."
1549,5,"I was shakey at first about ordering this item because of the price. I thaught it might be cheap made product. But it turned out to be very good! Easy to install, about fifteen minutes and they look great. The shipping was very fast. I will be buying some more for my other car."
1550,5,"As advertised, received it two days after ordering so no complaints there. You can't go wrong on this one guys."
1551,5,"This is my second SG2, my first one was stolen from my car, but now I have an extra cable! I primarily use it in my wife's car for MPG feedback. My wife appreciates the miles to empty gauge and has found that she modify's her driving style when she has the instant MPG readout. I occasionally will use it for reading trouble codes. (I have only had one, a fuel vent trouble that wouldn't clear, but the SG cleared it for me.)<br /><br />If you are trying to save fuel, this is your gauge. (Assuming that you have a compatible vehicle, see their web site.)<br /><br />If you want a cheapish code scanner, this does fine. (You will need the manual or the internet to decode the trouble codes, but that is easy enough.) It will clear the codes if they are not active."
1552,5,"This is by far the best tire dressing ever made....It looks just right, stays on for weeks, does not sling off and does not have an oily or greasy buildup on the tires....."
1553,1,I purchased teo of these lanterns this year. One for myself and one for a gift. The battery in both lanterns died after only a few uses. It was charged initially as per instructions.<br /><br />I returned mine to the wagan corp. on 6-23-10 and was told the battery was defective and they would replace it. They had to wait until 7-16-10 to send my replacement. I'm writing this on 7-21-10 and haven't received it yet.<br /><br />Would not recommend this product based on the poor battery or manufacturers slow response.
1554,4,"I find it hard to apply wax when I have to dry my car.<br /><br />Since you need to apply the wax WHILE your car is wet (right after shampooing), too much of the wax goes to waste when I squeeze the towel to dry my car.<br /><br />Other than that, it gives your car a decent gloss.  It also offers decent protection.<br /><br />Eagle One's NanoWax (spray type) is easier to apply but this one is cheaper where I'm from. :)<br /><br />HTH. :)"
1555,1,"When you search by vehicle, these refills come up.  Please note that the 16\\"" refill will fit perfectly on the OEM wiper, but the profile on this 26\\"" refill is wrong.  Before ordering, take the old refill out of your existing OEM wiper and compare with picture provided.  You will see what I am talking about."
1556,5,"The Glue works perfect and holds great, it does need a cap on it to keep it from drying out.. Great Product"
1557,1,I tried the product on my LED turn signal light bar and it only works on and off.   I didn't like the product at all.
1558,4,"Works pretty well. One quirk is every time you turn on automatically dials last phone number called. Music goes in and out while riding, but sound is pretty good when playing."
1559,3,If you want a very agressive sound you need this muffler.  You may not like it at higway speeds as it does make some interior noise.  Welded construction will last longer than cases. Nice price and fast free shipping.
1560,4,"It's a spark plug for my sons sled.  It has been a long cold winter and I didn't feel like driving into town just to buy a spark plug for the snowmobile. I guess thats being a little lazy but hey, atleast I have time then to fill out these product reviews for Amazon..........  Please review the spark plug you just bought??  Really??"
1561,5,"This White Led UnderGlow Undercar Light Kit is Satisfactory, and i am impress with this Product especially the remote control.    Frank Mc David"
1562,1,This was advertised for a Porter cable sander model number 7336 which came with a vinyl stick on face. The one sold is for velcro face. The seller said that Amazon improperly advertised it. Now I will probably have to pay shipping to return it.
1563,5,They are very easy to install. and I'm pleased as work very great. Very good lighting for my car.
1564,4,"Product was shipped fast in new condition.  Amazon store charged add't freight, while if I had bought direct from the sellers store, it would have been free."
1565,2,The go power inverter is a mid price true sine wave inverter. It's fuses can't be replaced. They so far have had a high failure rate.  They have replaced them under warranty but it's a slow process.    Do yourself a favor and put some more money with the purchase price and get a Xantrax true sine 1000 inverter.    It's more money but it's a WAY better inverter.
1566,4,"No complaints about the 0-2 sensor, but ('01 Corolla) be prepared to take the center console, glove box and driver side kick panel apart to reach the plug which resides under a plastic shield below the shifter on the passenger side. PITA!  Note: 1 - Have a 21 mm box end wrench and a hammer on hand to break the old one loose.              2 -This is the post catalytic converter sensor, the one by the engine was much easier to replace."
1567,5,"Back in 2006 i bought one of these back up alarm & as today i can say is that the product came out to be reliable & simple.<br /><br />The alarm is very easy to install ( just split the back up light harness & attach the alarm's to it & bam,the back up alarm is ready to go.<br /><br />It surprised me that for the price i've paid for it the back up alarm has lasted for that long,i bought another car & installed the back up & it just don't give up.<br />I recall the price was just $ 15.00 & bought another for my brother-in-law to installed on his pathfinder & also he's also very happy with the alarm."
1568,5,"I bought this pump for my 2003 Pontiac Grand Prix.  Direct replacement for stock, went in easily.  For those of you with the same car (fits 2003-2007) you get at the pump by taking off the plastic in the passenger side fender well.  There are 5 or 6 screws, then it pops out.  Would be easier if you jack up the vehicle and remove the front tire.  Unhook the wiring harness, pop off the hose, and the pump just pulls out.  Works great.  It is what it is, a washer pump.    Update! 5/23/11  The pump I'd reviewed previously has failed.  I have purchased and installed another Trico and hope that it lasts this time.  I still think the price is fair, I'd just warn it might not be as durable as the original equipment (which lasted 6+ years compared with less than 2)."
1569,5,"Great product. It does what the manufacturer says it will,and the company couldn't have been more helpful in setting it up properly.Would strongly recommend both."
1570,4,"The LED light kit mounted easily enough to the rack after I fed the 3 wires thru the one threaded mounting hole. Problem is, there is no mounting bolt supplied that has a hole drilled down thru center for feeding thru the three LED kit wires. I guess I'll figure that out when I mount the tour rack on the tour-pak!    edit: One of the mounting bolts was wider and did have a hole through it for feeding the wires. No problem after all!"
1571,5,"Searched Amazon.com for an oil filter for my HHR and found one for a very reasonable price and shipping arrangement as well..    Yes I would duplicate this order again and will if it is still available when oil change and filter time comes around again.    This purchase allowed me to have a cap for the oil filter too as well as new \\""O\\"" ring which is necessary after a while over the multiple oil changes, but I prefer every oil change to be safe.    The price beat all local prices on this item and all Internet Prices I searched so needless to say I made the purchase along with a few other items needed and related. The free shipping was included with the purchase of these additional items and this review will be cut and pasted to those items as they are reviewed along with one added piece of information on the special socket for the oil cap removal review."
1572,5,"I was able to install these by myself in less than 10 minutes! Was very simple. (keep in mind I am not only a women, I am blonde! lol)"
1573,5,Had a lot of trouble taking the back paper off with the letter not staying secured to it
1574,4,They look just like the picture and are half way heavy duty floor mats. We did not have to trim them so no troubles there. My mom LOVES them - they were her birthday present!!!
1575,3,"While I wish this were bigger, it does fit well and still allows for the opening of the hidden storage area in the second seat. It is not elegant or fancy, but I have storage area and a place for trash."
1576,5,"Excellent product!!  The hassle and frustration of hitching up my goose-neck horse trailer are in the past.  What a cool product.  Even my husband uses it now.  Works great on bumper hitch trailers, too.  Can't be without it.  Really great!"
1577,5,"I bought a cheapo brand O2 sensor when I first needed one and it failed again in less than 10,000 miles. I should have known better, the Bosch was only 10 bucks more through these guys and the quality is OEM or better.<br />Fast shipping as well, I would highly recommend them."
1578,5,"Exactly what I was looking for, Just as described. And according to the paperwork that comes with the helmet, it is DOT Approved! I love that the shipping was faster than the date stated.<br />Thanks Jafrum!"
1579,5,This steering wheel looks great on my VW Dunebugy.It was the exactly as advertised.  Was very simple to install using all the Grant products. If ever I need another steering wheel it will be another Grant.
1580,3,"it works as advertised, and I think it does a great job with the rims.. it's just too much work for what it does."
1581,5,"Very simple to install, but will require a second person to help with the tailgate.  This is my second \\""EasyLift\\"", as the first one broke.  Really reduces the weight of the tailgate.  I can close my very heavy (Ford F150)tailgate with one finger."
1582,5,These water blades are awesome...i was very skeptical on them cause ive been using chamois for years and years...they always left scratches on the paint like terry towels....i worked in the automotive body industry and all we ever used was this water blade and it worked great...even on a freshly new painted car it would not leave scratches.
1583,5,"Immediately I got to the products, initiated the installation of new windows motors of A1 Cardone replacing old motors in my car Mercury Cougar. The electrical motors functioned properly, are quieter and rotate quickly. For now, I am pleased with the quality of products A1 cardone."
1584,5,"very good quality. installed with over the rail bed liner in a 2007 ram. Had to cut square holes in the liner (chore) to install the rails. After some weather change though, it looks like the bed liner will warp along the top of the rails due to thermal expansion. Hopefully some double sided tape will hold them down, if not I will have to make the holes in the bed liner bigger to allow movement. They do look very good and would be very easy to install without an over the rail bed liner."
1585,5,"For you 87-93 5.0L Mustang guys and gals who want to read the codes your Pony is kicking out without going through the hassle of counting flashing lights or listening to annoying beeps, get this code reader. You get a user's manual with easy to read directions as well as all of the codes with explanations of what they mean. The digital read out is easy to read and understand and you can run the diagnostic tests with this device as well. This is light-years ahead of the flashing, beeping scanners that cost the same!"
1586,5,"I have these seat covers in my car and almost everyone I know has made a comment about them, I've enjoyed them very much, thanks!!"
