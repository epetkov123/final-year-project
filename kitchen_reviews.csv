0,5,just what i need! awesome!
1,2,The coffee maker makes excellent coffee and the design that lets you swing out the works to fill with water and coffee grounds without pulling it from under the counter is a great feature but the poor functioning glass carafe ruins the joy. I just can't pour water into the unit without a deluge on the counter no mater what position or speed I try and  I now take my cup to the sink to pour my coffee to catch the excessive dribble.<br />  I have contacted De Longhi CUSTOMER SERVICE to see if they have a solution and I am waiting for their reply. The problem (as I see it) is the carafe has a plastic lip completely around the top and it disrupts the flow from the spout.<br />  In the meantime I have been using the glass carafe from my De Longhi DC76T 12 cup coffee maker which is all glass (except for the lid and it works well. I purchased the DCF6214T to replace the damaged DC76T and thankfully I hadn't discarded the old unit yet.<br />  I would hope De Longhi will see the problem and have a &#34;Recall/Replacement&#34; program for the current Glass Carafe's.
2,5,Love this grill. My husband will cook now! We have had it for over 6 months. I do with the top came off for easier cleaning but it works great.
3,1,"This little spoon rest melted onto my Cuisinart stainless steel pot. My husband had to take the spoon rest and my pan out into the garage to pry it off. Although it came off, there was a considerable amount of silicone left on my $60 pan! The instructions didn't say unsuitable for gas stoves. :( I will call the manufacturer."
4,5,Love this for sinks!
5,5,"No,problems"
6,5,perfect
7,5,shoThe sauce pan is an excellent buy.  I would not hesitate buying another pan or pot in the same family.  Delivery time was much shorter than I<br />expected.
8,4,thanks - good item
9,5,"Heavy, but very gorgeous shade of read and so far great quality. I've used it to make some thick stews a couple of times already and I have no complaints. It cleans easily too, which totally makes up for it's weight."
10,3,"They're sturdy and attractive but they are not the easiest to clean. The textured surface, which is great for keeping plates from falling off, can't be briushed or even simply rinsed off. Nothing less than a dishwasher will do it. Still, they're an improvement of their predecessors."
11,5,"Excellent product, great price!"
12,5,Great item. Will recommend. Bought one for a friend. They really like it also.
13,5,Pros:<br />Works excellent.  I am currently in a really hot place and it keeps my drinks cold.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The bottle gets really hot to the touch if it is in the sun for more than 5 minutes.  (It still keeps drinks very cold)
14,5,"These egg shapers are adorable, and work well. They came in individual boxes (2 in each box), and were packaged really well. They do include English instructions, although they are very basic."
15,5,This larger grater is so much easier on my hands and wrist.  The handle is larger and the wide base makes it a breeze to stay balanced while grating.  It is very easy to clean inside since your hand will fit in there nicely. This one is well worth the higher price.  It doesn't even seem to take up that much more space to store it.
16,5,good
17,5,Great tool!!!  This tool makes it so easy to get the coconut from the shell....
18,4,It was a gift.  I guess he likes it.
19,5,Very well made and held many items for my &#34;hangover kit.&#34;
20,5,can't wait to use these during the holidays when I bake a lot.  looks great
21,4,this mixer is great for the average baker. For the price you pay it is well worth it. The only issue I have found with it is that the mixer does not reach to the bottom or all the way to the sides when mixing and may need a little assistance from you with a spoon to help move the contents around. Now if I was not being so lazy as to take it off the stand I think it would have been just fine.
22,5,Since LA got rid of plastic bags in markets I use these around the house for trash and cleaning the cat box. They work perfectly.
23,5,Awesome gadget.  I'm gonna be buying several more for Xmas gifts for my wine-drinking friends.
24,5,Got our machine today and it's a dream come true. I've made about 15 cups of coffee today just to experiment. Out of this world. No more Starbucks or other early morning coffee runs. It's very fast and makes very good coffee. Of course I use high quality beans. I'm using kicking horse brand and got the espresso beans I'm going to try. If there's any problems I will be back to let y'all know.
25,5,"beautiful packaging and design, fast delivery. Big hit with the ladies!"
26,5,very good product
27,4,"These trays don't turn leftovers into a gourmet meal, but they do keep leftovers for another day."
28,5,"works perfectly, just don't drop it in the sink as you will have to fish it out of the garbage disposal."
29,5,These were perfect! Best way to use them was to place them all on a cookie baking sheet and fill and place in freezer!
30,1,Entirely too small!
31,2,Very detailed engraving yet the opener is way too small !!!!
32,4,"This is a great solid cabinet and I am happy I got it. It matches my dinning room as if I bought them together. I will say to anyone looking to buy this, please do not hesitate! Very little assembling, rich espresso.<br /><br />HJS, New Jersey"
33,5,I use my little dish for salt scrub in bathroom! Perfect
34,4,Grind is nice and consistent with this. Only downside is that it takes about 20 minutes of continuous turning to semi-finely grind 5 tablespoons of coffee.
35,4,My daughter loves these but many were broken
36,5,"Finally, I don't have to keep replenishing coffee filters. This fits perfect in my 6-cup teapot that has a 3-inch diameter opening. Mine has clipped shut easily and stays closed. I've used it multiple times already. It's just barely big enough to fit 6 scoops of coffee in it. I haven't used it for tea or anything. Nothing has stained, so far. With it being extra fine mesh, I didn't have any problems with coffee grinds pouring into my cup. The coffee tastes better brewed from this in a teapot than from a coffee pot. Wish I'd a done this years ago."
37,5,"I bought one of these about 8 years ago, and used it a LOT!  When I got married the wife used it even more.  Bought 2 this time around.  It makes draining vegetables effortless.  Definitely worth having in the kitchen!"
38,5,"Good, easy to use timer; I carry one with me when traveling, to use for short naps wherever I may be"
39,2,"I had a similar device for decades, but lost it in a move. This one readily loses cans off the back side, unlike the original I once had, thus requiring removal of the rack to retrieve the lost can, which is also blocking the upper tier from further movement.  Save your money."
40,5,Nice product. Well made. Great price!
41,5,Just what I needed.
42,4,Love these salt and pepper shakers.  The only thing I am a bit confused with is why they are being sold in 3's.
43,5,I am still amazed at how these work.  The first time I used one I tried to lift the lid up and it came away very easily tricking me into thinking that the bowl wasn't really sealed.  I then picked it up by the handle to see if the bowl was really sealed and it WAS!!!  Very impressed with this idea and I love using them.  They clean easily and are simple to use.
44,3,New lunchbox looked used. Perhaps made in a dirty shop? We were able to get it mostly cleaned up.
45,4,Looks good assembled well lid is a little hard to get on some times but overall. Happy with it
46,5,"I purchased this over a year ago and it does the job very well. If I wanted absolutely accurate temperature readings, I would buy a Fluke for over $180 to $400. For $14, you can't go wrong! So, ignore the whiny 1 star (sic) rocket science babies, and get this product. Unless of course, you're working with mil spec tolerances. Then buy the top of the line instruments."
47,3,"We really try to be fair in our reviews so If you have skinny hands then this will work well for you. The gloves are long which is good. However, they are skinny all the way to the top. My hands are not skinny towards my elbows. What happens then is that because it it very stiff the gloves maintains its lenght leaving my fingers in palm of the glove.  I have to work very hard to keep my fingers to stay in place at the bottom where they should be. But the second I open my hands to grab the pan out of the oven the gloves shoot foward leaving my fingers in the palm of the gloves again. Baking cakes are fine because your hands tend to be around the sides of the pan, but with lasagna pans the handles are at the top and so the gloves tend to dip inside the food. Have not dropped any food so far but I have to make sure that I have the stove above clear so that I can put the food down quickly before it drops out of my hands."
48,5,Great quality for the price.
49,5,Works great
50,5,GOOD SPARE!!<br />STILL HAVE OLD WORKING ONE FOR 15 YEARS!!<br />VERY RELIABLE!!!
51,2,"Just like other reviews, the battery was dead on arrival. No big deal I thought, I have extras. One week later the replacement battery was dead also. I used it once a day to measure water temperature. Sampling rate is also VERY slow. Save your money and get something else."
52,4,"Works great so far! Love the no carafe feature and easy dispensing button for coffee in any sized cup or mug. Also coffee is always ready in the morning for me(the wonderful coffee smell really add on to my morning alarm) with the great auto-on feature.<br /><br />*PRO: auto-on time set feature, no carafe, hot coffee every pour, easy to use!<br />*CON: water condensates on the top cover lid and usually droplets fall outside the machine when it's opened after use."
53,5,Love these!
54,5,"love this, love my coffee."
55,5,Great article. Come as expected.
56,5,Just as expected in picture
57,5,Does what it is meant to
58,5,"I purchased 2 boxes through Amazon.com just over a week ago and have been using 1 of them for my 5 year old that is attending Summer School.  I have been using a different brand of bento for my older daughter (8 years) for the last 2+years.  They are okay, but difficult to open for little fingers and not all containers are leakproof.  I needed something better and easier since my upcoming Kindergartener has delays and difficulties, including fine motor.  She has used the box for the last week and LOVES it.  I love it too.  The box is easy to open and has enough compartments that I can give her several food options letting her decide what she wants for lunch.  Big bonus: Does not leak!!  The only thing that would make it better would be a place for spoon/fork and more colors.  Thanks for a great product, 5 stars."
59,5,nice product.
60,5,Love this juicer! No problems to report.
61,5,"Amazing. My maid of honor bought them for my bachelorette party. We were in San Francisco where they don't really mind if you drink in the parks as long as you don't have glass. We relaxed in the park overlooking the SF bay and Golden Gate bridge, while sipping our wine. It was perfect and I would recommend these to anyone and everyone! Definitely going to take them camping."
62,5,Awesome!
63,5,It was a gift for my Son he likes it very much
64,5,"This style is unique, comfortable, and easy to use. Worth it :) Doesnt includes batteries AAAx2"
65,5,Love it!
66,1,The inside is not ceramic. ..rough. no good
67,5,Perfect replacement to my coffee maker.
68,5,"My new K200 Brewing system is everything I need! It's perfect in size and the color matches my kitchen perfectly. My favorite new setting on this system is the digital touch screen and the fact that I can brew a &#34;stronger&#34; taste. Love it! Thanks, Keurig for the free pods for this review."
69,5,Im sorry I had a business trip. So now Im writing this review. I haven't use it yet but It looks pretty nice! I will use it soon.
70,5,"Great gift for a grandmother, was a hit at the birthday party. Cute idea!"
71,5,"cute bag, worth the price."
72,5,Good quality. It is nicer than I was expecting.
73,5,"Simple, accurate, easy to clean. Easy on batteries."
74,5,Good choice
75,5,"LOOKED EVERYWHERE FOR THESE FOR YEARS, I HAD ONE SEVERAL YEARS AGO. DELIGHTED!!"
76,5,"Really good product, fast shipping and nice price...I would do business with this company again."
77,4,"Love the knife block, but the color was not as shown.  It was much darker and I would prefer the lighter color."
78,5,"These charms are really cute.  The magnets are super strong, enough to the point that they all stick together if they get anywhere close to each other.  Everyone who has come to our house and used them raves about them.  The palm tree did pop off the magnet, but nothing a little superglue can't fix!  They even hold strong through the acrylic wine glasses we got to use around our pool.  You'll love these wine charms!"
79,5,"Gotta say that I love this pan. When they say &#34;non-stick&#34;, they MEAN &#34;non-stick&#34;. You will not have to use oils of any kind with this pan. You get a clean no-stick cooking experience every time out. I've used it to brown meant, make sauces, cool pork sausage, and fry eggs. Performs like a winner every time. It's a good size for general cooking. Highly recommended."
80,5,"A little stiff at first, but very helpful to transfer to the pot"
81,5,"Fairly accurate.<br />I didn't calibrate or test it except checking my oven temperature, which matched what I had the oven knob set to.<br />Convenient size."
82,1,The coffee pods did not load properly so I ordered a second machine. The same problem occurred so I had my money refunded. This machine should be redesigned.
83,5,Love it! Converted my bottles with ease. My 5 and 3 yr old can manage this and not backwash
84,5,"Most companies have no guarantee at all, and for the quality product you receive and the promise of them lasting until the end of eternity I actually got one of the larger sets. I have 8 CUTCO table knives and they are still ridiculously sharp. In a few years I will gladly pay the $10 shipping charge to have all 18 of my knives sharpened. The quality is defiantly worth the cost as long as you think of it as an investment."
85,2,The lid sticks! I have to use a gripper to remove it and it's a struggle. Very disappointed.
86,5,"Great and big slow cooker. Analog, so no timer ability, but I'd never use that anyway. I've used this for over a year now and no complaints. slow cooking is the best, and very easy. This is a staple tool in my kitchen. Only thing it needs, which others have mentioned, is an indicator light that it's on. I'm always paranoid it's not, so I wait around and feel if it's getting warm before leaving it to slow cook."
87,4,I liked this tray but it was a lot bigger than I had thought so I had to return based on size for my ottoman.  The quality and workman ship is very good.
88,5,Love the colors very vibrant.  Fit well into cupcake pan.  Peeled from cupcakes pretty easy. Cleaned up well.
89,3,nonstick ceramic  ok
90,5,"perfectly protected, arrived earlier which was a nice surprise and look great."
91,5,Great!!!
92,5,My Husband uses this every week!! It has been a great purchase and already paid for it self in savings from the brewery's growler charges.
93,5,I used to have this Cucina Pro Ricer and I could not find it.  I use it to make Italian Gnocchi and its great product to have and the price was right!
94,5,Good
95,5,Love the magnet. I had bought it to help out my hubby who seems to never see the clean button light on our dishwasher. Did not check to see if we had a metal front on our dishwasher (LOL)  so it will now be gifted to a lucky family member who does have a metal front dishwasher. Nicely packaged with gift card and drawstring bag.
96,3,Holes are a little big so you have to be careful using it.
97,4,Great coffee maker. My husband am I use it everyday
98,5,"Love the color! Works as good as our old Brita slim, but hold much more water, which is exactly what we were looking for. Perfect for us."
99,5,Excellent!
100,5,"This was exactly as expected. Shipped promptly, well packaged. Looked nice on Grad day!"
101,5,FINALLY. A great toaster without spending a fortune! I just couldn't bring myself to spend $100 and up for a stainless steel toaster. I am amazed at how well this one works. Perfect toast every time. Even toasting. Looks great on my counter. Separate settings on both sides. Can't beat it for the $$$!
102,5,"These were very cute and, for the price, couldn't be beat! I was able to save money on plates and cups (just bought those at the store to match the napkins) and it was still apparent that the party was dinosaur themed!"
103,5,I love this tea cozy. It really keeps the tea hot for much longer in the teapot. Plus it's really pretty.
104,4,Great option for having bottles at home and work.
105,5,"I love the heaviness & the way it chills.  I highly recommend this product.  I still use a wooden rolling pin in addition to this rolling pin, but this works very well when the wooden pin won't."
106,5,Excellent for all sorts of veggie and making curly fries (although sweet potato fries don't come out as well)
107,5,"Cool bottle, works like it should. Easy to clean. Just make sure the flip top has clicked closed before you shake it. It’s a solid click, you’ll know. I learned this the messy way."
108,4,"Excellent knife for travels, the case is key for taking the knife with you every were!"
109,5,Super cool!  Cubes are cute.
110,5,I used these to store homemade baby food. Squears are perfect size and easy to poop food out.
111,4,"I do a lot of cooking from scratch, usually one dish affairs or something over rice. I've tried all kinds of kitchen gadgets, from electric processors to mandolin slicers, etc.  But getting a off-brand Santoku style knife convinced me that it was just as fast...and easier to clean!<br /><br />I later upgraded to a Santoku knife from a company that makes them in Iowa, and it was an improvement over the off-band import from China. So I decided to take the leap and get this one.<br /><br />For vegetables (potatoes-onions), the Iowa one works about the same, but the handle is not as nice.  For raw chicken breast, this one clearly cuts better. The indentations may be helping. The handle is much better and allows more control.<br /><br />So I'm happy to have it, but it did not trump the Iowa-made one $100%, which can be found for about $7.<br /><br />But it is a nice knife and is the &#34;right tool for the job&#34; for me!"
112,4,"hats were adorable and a big hit, but the elastic was quite small.  All the 8 year olds had lines around their faces from being squeezed and they were uncomfortable.  If they only wear them for a very short time or the kids are small it shouldn't be a problem."
113,5,I first bought this as a gift for my granddaughter! I liked it so much when it arrived that I ordered one for myself! Love it!
114,5,It's great.  Just the right size and very sturdy.
115,5,Easy to install
116,5,Incredible!!!
117,4,It was a great purchase and perfect topper for my cake!
118,5,Beautiful addition to my late wife's huge glass living room table!
119,5,"The Ozeri Epicurean LED Kitchen Scale is not only a beautiful item but is also an excellent kitchen scale.  I've owned several and this is by far my favorite so far.  It is accurate, very sensitive, has a large load capacity and is simple to operate.  And it is very easy to read.  It has a large display as well as excellent contrast between the display surface and display colors.  The glass top removes easily should it require cleaning and reattaches just as easily.  Definitley give it some consideration if you are looking for both functionality as well as eye appeal."
120,5,"I was hesitant to buy at first, the first thing I check is the 1 and 2 star ratings to see what the chief complaints were.  For the price, the negative reviews were something to give me pause.  After researching awhile, the Breville still came up on top and the average rating is still very good.  I went ahead and purchased as an anniversary gift for my wife since she destroyed the other milk frother we had (don't ask).  Things that seem to give people trouble with this model is failure to froth or heat adequately.  Ours  worked as advertised out of the box and heated quickly as well as made healthy amounts of froth."
121,5,great item
122,5,I love this thing. It's very sturdy and keeps my pans organized! I actually use it lying flat not standing up because I have a shelf in my cabinet But it works just as well and the pans slide right out/in!
123,2,This product was a real waste of money I'm glad it was inculded whith something else I had bought. Because I wouldn't have purchased it. It doesn't put grill marks on the meat and it does smoke up the house when you use it.  I think that my George Forman Grill does a better job of cooking than this does.
124,5,"Excellent candy thermometer! Never had any issues. Calibration is easy, read is easy. I wish it had just one more feature though: an alarm for when it reaches a specific temperature. Other than that, it's pretty much exactly what you need for on the go cooking/baking."
125,3,Make sure you realize that these are 4 signs with double signs. You will not have access to all 8 at same time.
126,3,"Fine quality for the price, but if you're not careful the handles snap right off while you're scooping dry ingredients. I've already broken two :("
127,5,LOVE THIS CROCKPOT! ITS A VERY ATTRACTIVE ITEM FOR A GREAT PRICE! GLAD I ORDERED IT. DELIVERY WAS VERY FAST TOO.
128,3,"They are great. They are sturdy and look nice, but don't microwave the lids, they will never lock onto the glass container again"
129,5,We have already used it several times.  Absolutely love it.
130,5,Handle needs hot pad after boiling but good kettle
131,5,Good
132,5,They were perfect For the bridal shower and mimosas.  They are exactly what I need for my mother n law 85th birthday celebration in August. Great buy .
133,5,buy it
134,3,The fingers seem to chatter when sharpening a knife
135,5,Works awesome.  It's nice and small to store and i got one for my friend and my sister.  They both called me raving about how great it is.  Great and useful kitchen gadget.
136,3,Carrots and cabbage - not very successful.  Still love the zucchini spagetti!
137,5,best way in the world to make fantastic coffee!!!
138,5,"&#34;Great item, excellent quality. Works well.&#34;"
139,5,great product
140,5,Nice board - sturdy but light enough to clean easily.  Very pleased.
141,5,perfect!
142,5,The size and quality are even better than I hoped for! I love it.
143,5,Warms up coffee very fast
144,1,Leaked all over
145,5,And I use it in conjunction with the filters that fit this... My Keureg 2.0 is liberated! I get to drink my favorite coffee by the carafe full! Yay!!
146,5,Truly keeps beverages hot for hours.
147,5,saves me time on clean up
148,1,I bought this and after 2 weeks it broke the piece connecting the wheel to the handle. Very disappointing.
149,3,"People don't seem to know what grind I should have with it, and I haven't been able to pinpoint it yet. Also allows quite a bit of sediment at most grinds I've tried. If it's too course, it isn't flavorful enough. If it's too fine, you'll be chewing your coffee by the last 1/5th of it. Hard to find the threshold. Also a bit wobbly."
150,5,Works better than the'70s one with the crank handle it replaced.
151,1,Doesn't work.
152,1,Mini is the word. Broke handle on first use.
153,3,"Wish I'd passed on these brushes.  Any good bottle brush would have worked as well.  My main issue is there is no way to hang them.  They have to lay on their sides and I don't care for having bottle brushes rolling around on the counter.  I did find a &#34;home&#34; for them, but they are not handy and close at hand.<br />If they had a hanging loop on the ends, they would be a much more useable product!"
154,5,"Ordered June 4th arrived June 8th. Test run of grapefruit, banana, blackberries with some h2o went great. If you've ever attempted to blend citrus in a regular blender you know to expect some chewing. Will update if anything changes. Well worth the money so far."
155,5,"Let's get the obvious out of the way... For $1.50 per piece, you're not really expecting high quality here, are you? These are knives. Knives you can cut things with. A variety of knives. That match. And have a convenient and attractive storage container.<br /><br />This set has to be evaluated with the quality for the expense in mind, and I think it's a winner. I had several low-budget knives when I was in college and just out of college and paid more than $1.50 each for them, and still I made sure to pack them when I moved to the next place... until I had real income and could buy real knives.<br /><br />So let's talk about the nature and extent of the low-budgetness. Reversing my usual approach, I'll start with the cons:<br />1. Very thin blades that easily bend<br />2. These are not full-tang blades, of course<br />3. There is a limited one-year warranty (go to quikut dot com), but you have to pay shipping and include $2.00 per knife to cover return shipping, so hey, that's not going to be worth it.<br /><br />But there's some pros, too!<br />1. Dishwasher safe (I imagine they will last longer if you don't do that, though)<br />2. They arrive plenty sharp to cut things. And like the low-budget knives of my youth, you should be able to sharpen them again when they get dull.<br />3. I find the handles comfortable, as described (&#34;ergonomic&#34;)<br />4. It's nice to have a knife block! This one resembles a 4x4. But so what? It's cheap! Oil it and it might end up looking nicer.<br />5. Color choices.<br />6. Made in USA (&#34;of domestic and foreign components&#34;)<br /><br />For those on a budget, I think this might be just what you're looking for."
156,3,"There is a lot to like about this set.  The quality of the material is good, and they are attractive.  I just cannot see myself using these as a salad set because all the bowls (serving and the 4 smaller bowls) aren't big enough, in my opinion.  The 4 smaller bowls have a small diameter - HOWEVER, they are quite deep.  They almost seem more appropriate for soup, but I'm not sure the material is meant for such heat.<br /><br />I WILL use these, however, for other purposes.  The serving bowl could be used for a side dish, and the smaller bowls could make attractive options for condiments, dips, etc."
157,5,Great quality koozie!
158,5,Is perfect for my boy
159,5,Look and feel: I wasnt very sure about the wooden handle not staining in oil. But it has stood the test of time and the handle as well as the silicone bristle part is very good and has no stickiness or stain developing on it.<br /><br />Working: Works perfect for basting. I use it to apply oil on my Indian flat breads and its perfect.<br /><br />The size is very convenient too. Fits in drawers and has an ergonomic grip. Five stars!
160,2,"I was doing a meringue (copper bowl, cream of tartar) and it worked fine, but it takes several minutes to get it to froth properly.<br /><br />I suddenly noticed it pausing or slowing down or stopping.  Turns out the shaft coming out of the motor was hot enough to melt the gears inside the collar that the whisk goes into.  I need the whisk not the blender for meringues.<br /><br />So, short answer, it worked, but because it heats up (no way to vent the heat), it will melt inside.<br /><br />But it is inexpensive.  If I keep doing meringues (for low-carb), I will see if there is one that has cooling or a different gearbox.<br /><br />So it works as long as you don't try doing it to much."
161,5,great
162,5,"keeps it hot for a long time .Received as a gift for hunting season ,After 8 plus hours of temp 10 to -5 still hot."
163,4,good
164,5,We were tired of breaking corks and then having to fish the pieces out of the wine.  This wine bottle opener is a jewel.  It works every time and we are grateful not to have to use a strainer when pouring wine for guests.
165,5,These are my fourth set as my other 3 sets were just not enough... If you're having more than 4 guests over to 'tie one on' I highly recommend buying at least 4 sets as each Sphere lasts about 2-3 drinks (depending on how quickly you can knock back your drinks)
166,5,"Cute, whimsical mug!  I love it.  I especially like how the interior is NOT white, but blue.  It, therefore, won't stain easily. I plan on buying them for friends as well!"
167,5,all around a good deal for the price.
168,3,Great but where is the handle logo?
169,5,"This manual chopper is easy to use and clean up. The blades are sharp and does a good job mincing onions, garlic, ginger, tomatoes etc. We had great success making salsa, gaucamole and baby food. This is portable doesn't use electricity and can take it with use while travelling. We use it everyday in our kitchen. It is a must have tool for making healthy recipes."
170,5,great at getting the burnt stuff out of the grooves in my grill pans.
171,5,A beautiful knife block. Looks like it was custom made for my drawer. Great quality for a great price. I'm very pleased!
172,5,"My neighbor had a pad like this in her kitchen, and once I found out where she got it I just HAD to have one.  It remains lofty and doesn't flatten with use.  Everyone of my friends who steps on this pad raves about it.  It sure take the stress off of my feet when I am doing dishes.  The design around the perimeter is pretty and not at all hard to clean like I feared it might be.  I love this pad."
173,5,Very pricey but does a good job simple to use and dries the lettuce - compact to store
174,3,"Was not quite what I expected from advertizing they posted,"
175,4,"I got those with no problem, it was the other item. The screen cover for my camera. They couldn't figure out the address"
176,5,"We had the larger size originally, but always complained that it was too big for certain things I want to cook. The small one is great for grilled cheese. Good weight. Even heat distribution. Love this style of pan. Would recommend to anyone."
177,5,"Marvelous little &#34;gizmos&#34;.  Much easier to use, for me anyway, than the slide on type (always seem to hang up) and they keep the bags (of anything) sealed well and air tight.  I've got all the sizes, from these &#34;minis&#34; right on up to the &#34;jumbo x-large&#34; ones.  Can seal any bag, from the anti-static bag the E-ZPass travels in, up to the giant potato chip and cereal bags.  They can even be cut to a &#34;custom size&#34; if you always have a certain size bag on hand and don't want the plastic sticking out catching on things."
178,4,"Smaller than I expected but for the price, it works well enough."
179,5,They were Great
180,5,Fast shipping easy to use just what I was looking for!!!
181,5,Great color for a winter lunch box!
182,5,"We are pretty particular about the type and brand of kitchen items we buy.  We've had several peelers over the years and we just get rid of the ones we don't like because you can tell a difference in quality, although some disagree and think one is just like another.  Well let me tell you that this set is different than any set I've had before.  The construction is good and the stainless steel is thicker and more substantial than a lot of the ones I've had.  The blades are super sharp and I like that the end of the peeler is metal and not plastic or rubber.  I love that they are dishwasher safe because I do not like washing peelers.  The handles are large and it took me a second to get comfortable holding them, but they are shaped perfectly for me and it makes it easier to use.  Even with a lot of pressure I don't have any issues with the blades swiveling.  I have used them to make orange peel curls, peel eggplant, potatoes, carrots, cucumbers, and they were even sharp enough to peel tomatoes.  I tried their recipe for sweet potato chips and they came out great.  I used the peeler to make really thin slices for the chips and my kids love them!  I'm sad to say that my previous favorite peelers just got moved back in the drawer to make room for these up front. *I purchased this product at a discounted rate to be able to test out and leave an honest review."
183,5,These food strainer are great for quinoa and loose leaf teas!
184,5,The recipe was easy to follow. Just opened my first bottle tonight and it was more than i expected. Tastes is fantastic. I will order again for sure!
185,5,"I bought this pan, along with the smaller one (which is perfect for making my caramels).  I love this pan! I use a mixture of 1:1 cornstarch and confectioner's sugar.  The marshmallows come out super easy. I bought the silicone cutting wheel, too, and absolutely love this.  This had made my marshmallow making so much easier to do-- and it cleans up beautifully."
186,5,"Makes a great cup of coffee!!  Solid stainless steel, brews fast, love it!! Advise using the square wrap around filters."
187,5,Easy to fill and remove ice.  Much better than the individual balls.  A perfect complement to a glass of whiskey.  Cheers!
188,5,Love these. Love the fact that they do keep your hands safe from the hot dishes or pans from the oven. This mitt is so much better then the classic cloth ones. I don't feel any heat transfer when taking out items from the oven.  The length comes over the wrist about four inches which keeps the hands safe from steam etc.
189,4,Great toaster
190,5,GOOD
191,5,"I have been using this regularly for about a month now, and it has definitely held up to use! I love this infuser. One of my favorite teas is fairly fine, and I have no issues with tea falling through the infuser. The infuser works wonderfully without causing a lot of extra leaves floating in the tea, and it always makes a great cup. The clip on the end is great for clipping onto the mug, and the infuser is easy to clean. Customer service was excellent and I would definitely order from this company again!"
192,5,"got it for my in-laws.  They are enjoying it.  It seemed like the most reasonably priced, and I liked how salt and pepper are in the same dispenser--they only have one thing to bring to the table."
193,5,"Retro and awesome. Some complains on here I've seen were these aren't true coasters because they don't absorb moisture like cork coasters are unwarranted. (Facepalm). These hotties don't want your slimy, perspiring glasses on them. These precious circular pedestals sing sweet music when paired with a nice cup of joe sitting on your bar in the morning. Cheers!"
194,5,great quality and easy to use
195,5,Smaller than i thought but Awesome!!!! Super cute! And they fit!!
196,1,Very disappointed
197,5,Met my wife's expectations.
198,5,"Excellent quality price relationship, optimal size for me at 20 oz, professional look. Keeps drinks hot or cold while you are working or getting distracted from your favorite warm or cold drink.  No worries you can get back to your favorite drink at quality temperature you expect after taking care of distractions.  Spill proof, automatic sealing and easy cleaning lid make it and excellent investment. Bravo, works as described."
199,4,"I've been using mine for about four months now. Mine seems to cook hot, so I've had to learn to adjust my cooking time down by about 1.5 hours from what any recipe calls for. Other than that quirk, I love this slow cooker! It's easy to use, easy to clean. I've used each mode with great success and no glitches. This appliance gets lots of use in my kitchen!"
200,5,Excellent
201,1,"I will return it, only use it for a week and already broke"
202,2,I am returning this item without using it. The handles seem like some kind of cheap plastic. It doesn't have the &#34;heft&#34; I like to feel. Cooking is as much art as science; this cooker has neither the feel of an artist's instrument nor a scientist's tool.
203,5,"Love this mug!! The mug fits under my Keurig, and I take it to work with me in the morning. No more having to stop at the convenient store everyday."
204,5,Very nice little machine. I use this to make a healthier Spaghetti using veggies!
205,5,great quality for the price. ...rivals reidel
206,4,"I purchased this for under $2, and it was worth that price. The garland is quite long, and it is cardboard so fairly sturdy. The hearts are a bit larger than I had anticipated. It will go a long way as valentine's decor for only $2!"
207,5,Great product - best colander I've owned
208,5,Much larger than expected. Love it!!
209,3,"I truly can't figure out the rave reviews. The can opener is comfortable, seems durable, and was made in the U.S.A., so I generously gave it three stars. However, one small problem:  It doesn't open cans very well. Most of the time it leaves at least one &#34;uncut&#34; area; sometimes more than one. When I buy a can opener, I kind of expect it to open cans the first time, every time. I'll keep looking."
210,2,"Product arrived on time. The box had been opened, the sealed again with tape, so clearly not &#34;new&#34; as advertised. As I was pulling the bowls out of the box, I sliced my finger on a bowl that was badly chipped and had ragged edges. I returned the product for a refund."
211,5,"This thing is perfect for the price and cheaper than all the stores!<br /><br />I highly recommend this product. It's a great way to get the water you need every day. I have to trick myself most of the time :)<br /><br />It's sturdy, BPA free and affordable. Get it!"
212,3,Needs to be a little more leak proof
213,3,Not suck the container tight.
214,5,I used this in the bar area at my wedding reception for straws and napkins.  Worked great.
215,2,"I used this for about two months to make nothing but my breakfast smoothies 5 days a week. I made a sauce one day when it worked fine; next morning, it would not start. I have tried using it a few times after and still nothing. I am outside my return window, so this will just have to be junk."
216,5,Excellent product
217,5,Excellent pans
218,5,It was just what I was looking for!! And it was priced very reasonable
219,5,Works exceptionally well for 2 to 4 people.  Easy to use and clean.  The rice has been perfect every time.  Our old rice cooker would leave a crusty layer of almost burnt rice on the bottom; this one doesn't do that.  Very pleased with this purchase.
220,5,Great  !
221,5,"These Moscow mule copper mugs are so nice. They are well made, and very sturdy. I think they are great for traveling mugs as I've used them in my recent travels. They keep my beverages nice and cool for a long period of time, and my hot beverages warm as well. I like that it has a stainless steel lining on the inside. The handles are thinner, but has no effect on safely and easily handling them. I was given the opportunity to test these mugs complimentary, and share my honest unbiased experiences and feedback. These mugs have a nice shine and look so nice when washed and dried. You cannot use these mugs in the microwave or wash them in the dishwasher, as with any fine a quality products. Just warm water and some soap will get them nice and clean."
222,5,"One of the better kitchen gadgets I've ever invested in, and it works exactly as advertised.  This is perfect when cooking for one or two people when it's a waste of time and energy to heat a huge pot of water for pasta. The cooking times on the instruction card are a good starting point.  I like my pasta a little softer, so I add a minute or two.  I love having pasta again on a regular basis!"
223,5,Awesome
224,4,This is a high tech thermometer. I've never seen one made quite like this. It looks like a smart phone. The numbers show up big so there is no question about the reading. I received this in exchange for my honest review.
225,4,"A tiny bit smaller than what I expected, but, it will serve its purpose."
226,5,"Product arrived timely. The mug is elegant in look, easy to clean and keeps my coffee at the exact temperature I poured it in at."
227,5,Great coffee!!!
228,5,"Both pieces are nice and fit well into regular lunch boxes. Hot soups and stews stay hot until my son's lunchtime, which is about 3 1/2 hours from when he gets on the bus. Thermos has always been a good brand. This seller also shipped very fast."
229,5,"Worked well.  Required some break-in time as the tines on the bottom are not the same as the original.  The original had splits in the larger tines that merged with the motor.  These eventually broke off causing us to get this.  Once break-in period was done, operated very smoothly and quietly. Think Braun found their design flaw and fixed it."
230,5,"For fishbowl martini eye-rollers like me, the cordial version was worth the risk, but it ended up not being quite large enough for a reasonable (and small) martini.  You'll be sipping it from the table and then pouring the last bit.  For those it's working for, I'll maintain they're being comically accommodating during the measuring process.  For the gentle martini &#34;stirrers&#34; that think they'll circumvent half an ounce of water from the ice ... it's still not quite enough.  We need a 5.25 ounce martini glass.  So much weird stuff in this world, how does this not exist?"
231,5,loved them
232,5,I absolutely love mine! I am a Leo so of course I bought that one. The glass is large and thick without being too heavy!<br /><br />My lion looks fierce and is deeply etched. it's on a tall stem that seems pretty strong. The cup piece fits perfectly into my hand.<br /><br />In my opinion its most definitely worth all 5 stars because it's great quality glass and the etching is well done!<br />I recieved this at discount in exchange for my honest/unbiased opinion. All stated in this review are my own thoughts and experiences with the item.
233,5,Love this and use it almost daily. I have given these to many friends and family members and they love their Easy Greasy.  Also this product is manufactured in the great state of Louisiana!
234,1,I just used this and it quit working half way through cooking. I don't recommend this at all. And also it's to shallow.
235,5,"These Glass Sphere Salt and Pepper Grinder set by bobuCuisine Set works Great! Came well packaged in a box & in a timely manner. These grinders work perfectly, Easily adjusts to Control Coarseness. Covered Lid to Keep Freshness. Very Fancy looking. I received these at a promotional price to try out & give my honest unbiased opinion on them. And I absolutely love them. They actually remind me of eating in a restaurant where someone comes to you and crushes fresh pepper or cheese over your meal to your desired liking. They are a large size. And hold up a lot at a time in them. These have surely added a extra class to my dining table! Also these would make great gifts. Totally recommend these to add that extra high end touch to your kitchen."
236,5,"I usually don't write reviews unless the product is awesome,  but this is really exceptional product. It is solid, well build, flexible and strong enough at the same time. The fact it is one solid piece of silicone makes is super easy to clean. I highly recommend these spatulas. I will be getting more as a gift. I did a lot of research since I don't like to own to many kitchen gadgets but these will stay in my kitchen for a long time."
237,5,"My husband is the baker of the family. He loves baking cookies and cupcakes. However, I am always left to clean up the kitchen afterwards. Usually that means trying to chisel off the cookie pieces that are burned onto the cookie sheet. Thanks to this silicone mat, my husband can bake all of the cookies he wants and I don't have to spend an hour in the kitchen trying to clean up after him. It has definitely made things so much easier.<br /><br />I received a mat for free in exchange for this review. All opinions contained within are my own."
238,5,"nice balloons.  Paid extra to arrive on time, but worth it."
239,5,Great Product.
240,2,The butter always falls out into the water.
241,3,"Good idea, but using measuring cups can do the same"
242,5,These are so great! I was surprised at how sturdy they were. I love that they are silicon and I can use them on my nonstick cookware. Great buy!
243,5,"Item arrived on time, intact, and as pictured."
244,5,Absoultely tops!  My wife loves these.
245,4,"They seem built solidly enough. But I wouldn't want to put too much pressure on them like squeezing something through the mesh to filter out solids, like with blended soups."
246,5,Seems to work great. I put on my pans after cleaning and after warming the pan up a little.
247,4,Wish the plates were heavier
248,4,"Two small holes were on his chin, besides that it came in perfect condition."
249,5,works great
250,5,Beautiful..
251,1,I have never used such a hunk of crap before in my entire life. I used it once. Next time I go to use it screen was unreadable.<br /><br />You have been warned about purchasing this.<br /><br />I have since purchased the iDevices Thermometer. It's an extremely solid product and I absolutely love it.
252,4,The product does what it was intended fot!
253,5,"Just did not realize how HUGE they are! There was no measurements in description, so I was quite surprised to see utensils 13-14&#34; long! It doesn't sound like a lot, but they seemed very long. Quite heavy, too. Maybe, it's normal and I just happened to have only miniature ones before? ;-) Well, I am small person, after all, so for someone 6'2&#34; tall this would not look anything out of ordinary. Getting used to them :-)"
254,5,Beautiful! I am keeping it out all the time. It is functional and decorative. Love it!
255,5,"I guess I thought the holes would be smaller but tried shaking dry rice in it to see if the grains fell through, they didn't, so I am completely satisfied! Perfect size, comfortable handle and looks nice"
256,5,Perfect for mulled drinks!
257,5,"Love it, love it, love it.  This pie pan is great.  Good and sturdy and you will love the crust protector.  Money well spent."
258,4,"I liked the milk Further very much, a very good product, it does what it is suppose to do  and is very useful for me. Thank you."
259,4,Bought it as a present... Friend loved it... I just didn't read correctly and assumed it came w 2 glasses... Who drinks scotch by themselves? Well... I mean... Better for 2 ... Should come as a pair .. Wouldn't have minded paying a little extra...
260,5,Nice container the cover locks and with no leaks.  Very well made a little heavy but not a problem for me.
261,5,the best
262,5,Just what I was looking for
263,5,Very nice set.<br />I like the special effects as well.
264,3,Not a bad product if you dont eat a whole lot. Would be nice if there were larger subcontainers available.
265,3,I will give it 3 stars because it's a very nifty and cool design. No one else does cool BHOs but this is just the beginning. It is a bit smaller than it appears and it not deep on the bottom side like you'd think. Very cool and no one else you kno will have it
266,5,"I love these containers. I wash the bowl in the dishwasher, but the tops by hand."
267,5,Works really well and pretty fast for as much coffee as it makes.
268,5,Love this storage idea .. I won't forget what is inside.
269,5,Great product!!! Very happy!!!
270,5,"Love, love, love it.  Sturdy, great size, holds my double shot breve latte perfectly!  No more wasting cups at work."
271,5,EXCELENTE PRODUCTO
272,5,I gave this to my left handed Son who was amazed that such a thing existed.<br />Perfect for a lefty and Le Creuset quality can't be equalled.
273,5,"Made mojitos and initially the mint leaves and berries got stuck, so I strained the mixture and it worked great!"
274,4,"Needed a set of kitchen bowls that was durable and would not break. These bowls have a clean crisp look because of the stainless steal. They are large and well suited for all your kitchen needs when it comes to mixing and seasoning food items. They are also secure because of the rubber bottoms and don't move around the counter top.  They are strong but light weight. After years of owning beautiful stoneware bowls that eventually would break or chip, I am  happy to find these. One last added feature for me is that stainless steel is not porous and you won't get bacterial growth on your bowls."
275,5,"Cheap toothpaste holder that does what it's supposed to.  Bought this to replace an old one I bought somewhere else that broke after a couple of years.  Had this one about a year now, no problems."
276,3,not as good as I'd hoped. pops smaller amounts than my previous popper. takes longer to pop.
277,5,These work great! Plus they look nice!
278,5,"I absolutely love this cooking machine.  Wish I had known about it a long time ago.<br />  When they advertise it as a multi-cooker, they mean just that.  I can saute' and then either roast or slow-cook all in the same pot.  Haven't tried the steam function but, I know it's going to work well too.  The slow-cooker is really a true &#34;SLOW COOK&#34; and would be great if I had more patience.  So, when I want the dish cooked at a selectable temp, I just use the roast function in place of slow cook.<br />Roasted an entire chicken in it and WOW was it moist and flavorful.  Done to perfection...<br />Cleans up beautifully and looks great on the little table where I keep it."
279,5,Works good.
280,5,Best pan ever. I use it all the time. I had the pan for 5 years and it still works like new
281,5,Works just the way it is intended to.
282,5,This is the 2nd Krups Grinder I've owned. My last one ground my beans for 13 years and finally died a few weeks ago. I'm so thankful Krups still makes this product.
283,5,"These things are great, I use them every night to prevent rings on my bedside table."
284,1,Disappointed with this product. Fell apart within one month of purchase.
285,5,Works just like it says.
286,5,Love it!
287,5,Cute
288,5,Great for using my canning jars and a safe alternative to plastic storage containers.  Love these lids!
289,5,"I was in Japan for a year back in 2005-2006 where I was first turned on to Zojirushi rice cookers. Although it's very unfortunate they are now made in Taiwan (I think), they are still my absolute favorite rice cooker. If you only make plain rice, you probably don't need a rice cooker like this one, but if you like porridge, sushi rice, and other types, you may want to consider a rice cooker like this one with those options available. This makes perfect rice every time and I love the ability to set what time I want the rice to be done, whether it's for dinner or if I need the rice to finish right when I wake up in the morning, the timer works great."
290,5,"Really keeps my tea warmer, longer."
291,5,Great size Easter theme colorful bags love them<br />so big for alot of goodies thanks great price and<br />delivery
292,5,These straws are great. I looked online for for a while for these. They are exactly what I wanted swizzle straws that won't float to the top of my drink. I will never have to buy swizzle straws again.
293,5,Great glasses! Very well made. Clean look. Perfect way to enjoy a fine single malt (or whatever other drink you prefer). Great for truly experiencing all scotches have to offer.
294,5,I love this filter works great I was so disappointed when I found out my Keurig 2.0 couldnt use a filter then I came across this filter works like a charm high recommend
295,5,perfect. i like it.
296,4,"Small portable and quick - when you need coffee and your traveling.  We use the Folgers, teabag looking coffee.  The coffee pods are hard to find, but the Folgers single serving bags works just fine."
297,5,This little scale does everything I was hoping for. I love that you can weigh things in different units. This is exactly what I had been looking for.
298,1,"MY Hario Coffee Mill Slim broke down (the handle stopped rotating) I used only 6 times and it has been a month since I bought it. I want to send it back and get refunded. please email me the return address.<br />Thanks,"
299,4,"Being plastic, they are light but worked well."
300,5,Great size and the wash up nice.  Love that they are made in the USA.
301,5,"This is an absolute RAZOR! It cut's steak like a dream!<br />It's already followed me to several 4 star restaurants, and it's kind of fun to see the reaction when you brought your own steak knife! They then realize just how serious you are about your food, and of course have to try it, and they are always amazed at how sharp and easy this cuts!<br /><br />But the overall quality and utter sharpness (that holds too!) is amazing. I also purchased a few for some co-workers as gifts because of their reactions when using mine!"
302,5,Just perfect! I will be ordering more.
303,4,Wonderful
304,5,Nice. Got a compliment today when I was wearing it.
305,5,PERFECT for baked eggs!  PERFECT!!!  I do butter the wells prior to baking even though it is non-stick.  Works great!  THANKS!!!!
306,5,Fit my Vitamix perfectly.
307,5,"Prompt shipment, works as advertised!"
308,5,"Worked well for our pirate party. This is definitely a throw-away-after table cloth, but not so thin it rips at that one use or anything. Large enough to cover a 6 person table too."
309,1,It wasn't what I had hoped for so I ended up buying actual Port glasses from Reidel
310,5,"This was for my husband. He usually puts his cream in a mug in the microwave and sets it for a certain amount of time while he makes his coffee. He has a certAin way of doing it and won't let anyone do it for him. So lo and behold, he actually loves this brother! Probably the best thing I ever bought him and  no more messes in my microwave"
311,5,Metal ball will rusted
312,5,Excellent product! I have been searching for years for this type of pastry mat. Finally found this one. You can use it and it does not move. Best item I have bought on Amazon! Great product and great service from a great company. You won't be disappointed in this purchase!
313,5,"This is really high quality.  I ordered two of a different brand and had to return them, but this one is great!"
314,3,"Pans seem okay, release slider seems a little thin compared to others I have had. I'll know more on what I think of them after they are used."
315,5,Very pleased with the NutriBullet. Great experience with person selling the item
316,4,"I like this tray a lot...  PROS: # of compartments for veggies, size of compartments, made with durable seeming materials, the lid snaps on airtight, it is flat so you can stack other things on top of it.  ...except for one thing:  CON: I can't fit a container of Trader Joe's Mediterranean hummus in the middle and still close the lid (the hummus container is too tall). The hummus does fit nicely width-wise, though, and when the lid is off of the container."
317,5,"My family all uses this basket daily with our Gaggia Classic espresso maker. We have extremely hard water and end up replacing it every 12 months or so, but otherwise, it gives us consistent espresso and crema that we all just love."
318,5,"GOT IT TODAY, LOVE IT"
319,5,Great Fun
320,4,"Like it, but its loud. Not really a big deal, just beware if you're one of those quiet-freaks."
321,5,"Excellent rack, non-stick works very well.  Fits most of my roasting pans perfectly"
322,5,I LOVE IT
323,5,Forks. Forks everywhere.  I have twin teenage boys so my forks tend to disappear. A lot. Perfect price and quantity for not become an irate Mum over her darling teenagers taking her good silverware to use while fishing!!! And absolutely perfect for college kids or someone just getting started.
324,5,Great choice. Using it in a culinary class in college.  Would definitely order from here again!
325,5,"Perfect paring knife. Combined with matching chef's knife, I can slice and dice my was to culinary happiness. Highly recommended."
326,5,"Having purchased new cookware recently, this has made storage and care for the skillets a useful tool."
327,5,OK
328,5,Awesome little kit!! Easy to use and clean!! Exactly as described and just what I was looking for!! Thanks!!!
329,1,both times received broken.
330,5,I love my new Alkaline Water Pitcher; I use it everyday and the water tastes amazing. I usually buy spring water but now I soley use my alkaline pitcher and save lots of $$$$$. I like that the pitcher came with 2 filters!! I must say that I have been drinking alot more water than I usual do and I notice a difference within the way my body feels.
331,5,"We bought this coffee pot because we heard that the coffee tasted better in a percolator.  It is true!  It fills your house with such a wonderful aroma, we figured out the ratio for us for a full pot which is 8 cups, it is 2 1/4 scoops (my scoops are 1/8th of a cup).  Turn on high till it starts boiling and perking and then turn down to med high or for electric between 6 and 7.  Brew for 15 min and let sit 5 min to let all the water drain.  Remove insides and enjoy.  The coffee will be HOT.  Keep on low heat to keep hot.  We love it."
332,5,heat up amazingly fast and is easy to use
333,5,Works well - keeps our coffee hot - sure it doesn't pour as clean as a glass carafe but we think it works fine
334,5,"At Thanksgiving dinner, a friend of mine was chastised by her mother for not having a large enough serving spoon. This spoon is both large and sturdy, so I almost kept it for myself rather than give it to my friend."
335,5,Excellent
336,5,A little pricey. Please make some larger sizes.
337,4,You get what you pay for.
338,5,This is a high quality product. All the products I own from Le Creuset just seem to be a higher quality than most everything out there. They are not cheap but worth every penny
339,5,"Great quality, would recommend."
340,4,Funny gift!!
341,5,Thanks a lot!!
342,5,Used this right out of the box for the first time this weekend....great buy...outstanding machine.  I have a 30 year old Mr. Coffee grinder...still works!
343,3,"There is not time on this and the temperature stays light on the screen (but obviously not on)... But other than that, it works great!"
344,5,Son loves it.  Goes great with the Spider-man lunch box.
345,5,"This is the best can opener you will ever buy! Sturdy, smooth operation, comfort grip handle, will last for 25 years or more!<br />And the red handle makes me happy ! 😊"
346,5,Got it as a gift for my sister ...She loved it!
347,5,"perfect , well worth the money"
348,5,It's the best basic Dutch oven for home cooking at this price. The plastic lid handle rarely gets hot. I don't think you could use this for camping.
349,5,"Use all the time, not dangerous like the old pressure cookers."
350,4,A great companion for my mini blender! Perfect ice cubes for single serving smoothies!
351,5,"The color green is not lime green, it's a bit more of a kelly green which is a little disappointing.<br /><br />However, This has made me into a full-fledged tea drinker. It's changed my life! I LOVE it!<br /><br />*Although, Why is it that ALL appliances that NEED to be plugged directly into an outlet, and not an extension cord, have the shortest cords ever!?"
352,5,good
353,5,Supper cute and works great
354,5,"great product , fast shipping"
355,5,"Bought these stickers to put on water bottles for a birthday party. They worked fairly well except for my mistake of putting the bottles in<br />a cooler, which made the sticky part become useless. Other than that, very fun to have for some kind of party."
356,5,LOVE IT SO FAR
357,5,It works great
358,5,"Eggcelent , my father in law has had a egg timer for years and I wanted to find one. Found this one works great and I bought 3 of them"
359,3,"The filter is well-made and fits the Chemex well. I bought it in the hope that it would allow for more coffee oils to pass through, as the Chemex filters tend to filter out most of the body-providing oils, and I like the idea of not using a lot of disposable paper.  However, the filter is so porous that it allows too much sediment to pass through as well, which defeats the purpose of the Chemex system, and I might as well use a french press.  I tried using a coarser grind to lessen the sediment, but then the water flows way too quickly through the grounds and makes for a weak cup.  So, the filter might be good for someone else's purposes, but not for me.  Back to the paper filters."
360,1,"I have a recipe for quick workday breakfast muffins that I had previously made as a casserole or quiche. The ease of a muffin tray allowed for individual browning for each item and easier cooking.<br /><br />This muffin pan, however, I would not but again. Please be aware, this is not a single-molded muffin pan, this is a die-cut and weld muffin pan, meaning that a sheet of aluminum had holes cut in it, then a machine welded the cups over the holes. The result is a small crease where food gets stuck, guaranteed every time. I can see this being okay for those that use muffin cups or some sort of liner, but what's the point in getting nonstick everything if you're just using it to catch muffin tops? You might as well just spray the top part of a regular tray and be done with it.<br /><br />The food in the creases was a minor annoyance. The true problem I have with this product is the quality of the non-stick. After the first use, some food got stuck and I used a soft brush to scrape it out before placing it in the dishwasher (if you notice, the description clearly says &#34;safe to use in dishwasher&#34;). I used this item once a week for three weeks before it was done. The nonstick coating must have been washing off each time, as the second time presented a small challenge in removing the breakfast muffins, while the third time it was downright impossible to remove a single one whole. I got about half of the muffins out before I gave up, as I could just as easily scramble some eggs and put them in a tupperware container to get the same amount of food.<br /><br />Don't waste your money or your time on this product. I recommend single-molded muffin pans, as these have no creases (these also came into play when removing the muffins the first time, as they would cling on for dear life at the creases)."
361,5,"There are so many extras on this UberChef tool it's hard to name them all. Peel, slice, julienne, strip, and specialty blades provide all sorts of decorative options to your vegetable garnish ability. Quality stainless steel insures a long lifespan as well as easy cleanup. Another winner from the folks at UberChef. And the trademark hook on the handle offers another neat storage idea. No more fussing around the drawer looking for the peeler."
362,5,All the chefs have this type.
363,5,love whole chickens in the rotisserie
364,1,wrong size and count
365,4,I must have an early model of J. Lalanne power juicer because minor adjustments had to be made for a good fit on the spindle. Other than that it is very satisfactory and filters like the new original.
366,5,perfect size and extra storage is great for protein or BCAA.
367,5,Great Turnaround and it works like a charm.
368,5,"Aqua Water Filters are a great way to clean your water. This is a,sixty day supply. This is great for the environment. No more plastic bottles. Or even buying water. I like that these are easy to use. Overall I really like filtered water from the faucet then buying bottled water from a place I do not know."
369,5,Cap fits the jar well and closes tightly. Sometimes a little stubborn to open again but thats better than worrying about it spilling.<br />There is a little rubber washer in the pop up cap which is good for preventing leaks but one more thing to clean. You decide.
370,5,Always a great topic of discussion. Hubby even loves them!
371,5,Attractive for my kitchen and versatile spoon rest.
372,5,I have gotten so much use out of this. Just love it. Hint if you put soft cheeses in the freezer of a bit and then grade it works better other wise the last bit just mounds into butter above the blade.
373,5,"These plastic lids are so convenient to use. They work well but as many others have mentioned, liquids will leak nonetheless. HOWEVER, today I discovered that the lids also fit the Bormioli 'Quattro Stagione' glass canning jars AND that they fit better than on Ball jars because the Bormiolis do not leak! Go figure."
374,5,Well done 5star
375,4,Perfect size if you're needing something for a small side to go with the plate you are serving for guests. I used them for my wedding to serve the beans in and it was just enough for everyone and wasn't big like a cereal bowl. The only thing was ypubcould feel the heat of the beans through the bowl so it was hard to carry in your hand without feeling like you were getting burned. The material is pretty thin
376,5,"I bought this for our yearly Christmas and Super Bowl parties.  It works fantastically keeping the food warm without overcooking/drying it out.  My only complaint is that there is no spoon notch so that you can keep the spoon resting inside.  No biggie though, I just put small plates to rest the spoons on right in front. This server will be with us for many years to come."
377,5,Every one I gifted with this product (including myself) love it and appreciated the need for it - Every one should have a serving tray (especially a well-made sturdy solid wood craftsmanship product like this tray)!  I also bought bud vases to add more coziness to them!
378,5,"Easily the best colander I've ever owned. Super sturdy, easy to clean, easy to pour out. Buy this!"
379,3,The dinnerware I ordered was beautiful. Unfortunately 2 of the coffe cups were chipped I was very disappointed.
380,1,This set was absolute junk.  Looked like it was made in Pakistan.  Certainly not something Boker should be putting their name on...<br /><br />So bad I returned the 3 sets I bought.
381,5,Super fast shipping and great quality product!
382,5,This is very pretty. Also was easy to remove.Released  nicely. Shipping was fast.
383,5,Best knife value on the planet...I use it every day...stays sharp...no rust..sleek handle.  Wish I'de found this before I bought the high-end ones.
384,5,"It's a little larger than I expected, but seems well designed and it toasts my bread nicely."
385,5,Nice set
386,5,Works great
387,4,Love the cup! It was my friend on the road in Thailand. Works great with the Aero Press I travel with. May develop a neoprene velcro strap handle for it that will slip into the indent on the side. Can be tricky gripping the diameter of the cup for the dog walk with petit hands.
388,5,use this everyday! I love it!
389,5,Beautiful
390,5,"I was hesitant to buy this as I thought it might not work. It took about a month for it to come in the mail. It works perfectly for pineapples, just like the cored/sliced in the grocery store. I love how easy it is to use. The skin sort of gets stuck at the bottom of the slicer, so when you wash it make sure to get it all out with a knife so it does not rust."
391,5,"Boils water in no time. Made my tea making experience enjoyable and quick, everybody in my house loves it. Whether youre making soup, tea, noodles, whatever, this thing has our back. How can you beat such a convenience for about $25?"
392,5,Bought this as a gift for my boyfriends mom and she loves it.
393,3,"It's always in bagel mode, it seems. The outer faces get less heat than the inners, both slots, every time. This is how it's supposed to work for bagels, but it's stuck in this mode. Return is a hassle, and it's just toast, after all. I found a sweet spot setting where one side's a little light and the other's a little dark and I'm happy with that. Otherwise it's easy to operate, looks good, takes only slightly more cabinet space that its predecessor. Cord length is generous (for a countertop appliance). Crumb tray seems effective and is easy to clean."
394,5,Fragile but worth the extra effort to not chip them.  Great knives with a nice feel.
395,3,All of the tubs had mars/smudged places on them.  They just weren't as nice as I expected them to be.
396,5,Excellent &#34;rice&#34; cooker.  I use it for about 20 various superfood grains for my non-meat diet.
397,5,We really like the salt and pepper mills.  The best feature is the light to make it easy to see how much salt you are adding.  One of the pair was broken when we received it but Epare quickly rectified the issue.  Great job Epare!  You'll like these.
398,5,"Best purchase for me as I live alone and don't drink several cups. I appreciate the process of making coffee without a brewer, and I can taste the difference, especially when I get freshly ground coffee beans. I also will use this to make tea with loose leaves."
399,5,Nice colors. No problems
400,1,"The pattern on the material is cute.  It did keep food cold from morning until lunch but if I had leftovers, I had to still add an ice pack to keep it cold until we got home.  So if you need cold for 4-5 hours, this worked fine.  If you needed it cold 8 hours or more, this doesn't do the job. The biggest downfall though is the quality of the construction.  The Velcro is very cheap and stopped working after minimal use.  For this price, I was expecting higher quality and I know that there is much better Velcro out there.  This is one of the few things I have returned to Amazon in years of shopping here."
401,5,great gift!
402,2,Bought this one because it was the color pink got it and it was red not happy
403,5,"Good candle lighter at a low price.  Child-proof switch is pretty easy to use, and we have had no issues since first using."
404,5,"The real thing! Bodium real glass, cheery red holder works in a blizzard (no electricity) for a reliable pot of coffee everyday.<br />No waste, not expensive to buy or use or maintain."
405,5,"Beautiful, well-designed and built to last; fast draining and easy to clean.  Nice stable foot-ring keeps your food off the sink.  It's not collapsible...but then it won't fall apart in a few years, either.  I keep mine hanging by the ceiling (using the Oxo Steel Kitchen Tool and Utensil Rack); it looks good and is close at hand when needed."
406,5,used for my family year day dinner party
407,5,"Great travel mugs.  They keep the coffee or tea super hot, so you need to be a little careful for the first 30 minutes, unless you are like my wife who just drinks it down."
408,5,"A sterling (in the superlative sense) product. Streamlined quality & elegance, like a Mac computer. Very well made, lightweight but solid, well packaged. They come in the three most useful sizes. I have them hanging in plain view, as pictured. Note than when stacked they nest together very nicely, as it shows in the manufacturer's photo. It's handy for me to just reach and grab. They are easy to clean, and I've used them several times since their arrival a few days ago. This set would make an excellent wedding or bridal shower gift."
409,5,works just as expected.  i like having several temperature choices to choose from.  i wish it was in 10 degree increments all the way up.  one problem is the timer.  i set it for several hours sometimes to keep food warm.  it shuts off early.  am i missing something?
410,5,"I've got an electric grinder, but getting the grounds out has always been slow and frustrating, not to mention trying to clean it. The Jumbl makes it as simple as unscrewing and upending the jar. I use it with an AeroPress, so it's super convenient. I also feel like I earn my cup of coffee now; it takes me about three and a half minutes to grind two tablespoons of beans. I see in one of the other reviews that it's possible to adjust the burrs depending on how coarse or fine you want your coffee. So far I'm satisfied with what I got out of the box and haven't done any experimenting or adjusting. I've uploaded a photo of my grounds, in case it's helpful for anyone."
411,5,"I did allot of research and chose this cooker based on the size of my family, stainless steel construction, and most importantly it looked the coolest. This is really well made and the clear directions made it easy to use. What's nice is it comes with a cookbook, a cleaning brush for the steam vent, and a steamer plate that fits at the bottom.<br />I was blown away when I made my slow cooker split pea soup in under 20 minutes. My crock pot method used to take  a minimum of four hours. It was my first shot at using it and it came out perfect. I didn't even have to smash the peas down, this thing somehow did it for me.<br />I found it relatively easy to adapt my trademark recipes to pressure cooking. I just go on line and find a pressure cooker recipe similar to my own to find out how long to cook it for.<br />Hope this helps those who have no experience with pressure cookers. The time savings is great, and the food comes out really good."
412,5,I use them every day. They are great at mixing stuff up!
413,4,"Made with mostly plastic, not sure how durable it will last..."
414,5,Love this product so much!!<br />It is made of plastic which is fine but my point it is light not heavy  and easy to store ! It has a place to store the electrical cord which is nice !!<br />It works great easy to use<br />I love the cutter makes slicing the rolls in a proper size works great!<br />We have another product made by Nesco and we have had the product years and it it daily and have never had an issue so it was one of the reasons hoping this will be as good a product from Nesco!!<br />I highly recommend the vaccum sealer! The price is great too and you won't go wrong getting this product!!!<br /><br />the only issue I see which is not an issue really... you will need to freeze the item if there is any moisture... so I just put it in the bag.. seal .... freeze .... and the cut the sealed part and then vaccum seal... no issue!
415,5,"I cannot say enough good things about this garlic press! It is very heavy duty. I do quite a bit of cooking and this is much easier to use than my previous, less sturdy, press. My brother tried it and immediately ordered one for himself. It's also easy to clean. You will not regret purchasing this garlic press!<br /><br />I received a discount on this item to provide an honest review. The above statements is my unbiased review of the product."
416,5,Works great!  Item as described.
417,5,"My husband loves them!  They are very easy to use and very attractive.  Easy to clean as well, and light to hold.  Overall a great buy."
418,3,"This is my first electric griddle and it works okay.  The temperature varies but probably remains +/- 30 degrees.  Overall, this aspect of the electric griddle makes it much easier than cooking on the stove.  I also like the white surface because it radiates less heat than black.  However, I do NOT like the sloped shape of the griddle.  The griddle has a fairly drastic slope toward the middle and front - to drain grease.  This shape makes round pancakes virtually impossible.  The pancakes always run downhill and create a teardrop shape.  I would be much happier with a flat griddle."
419,4,These bags are holding up well for me so far. They're capable of handling heavy loads and take up very little space when collapsed. Good value!
420,5,"Seems to work very well, thanks. At a good price."
421,2,"Magnet is not that strong, slides off the fridge."
422,5,easy way for older kids to make their hot chocolate without having to use the stove or handle a hot kettle / pour boiling water.
423,5,Received one as a gift earlier this year and use it all the time!! I purchased several as gifts for friends and relatives who occasionally drink red wine but don't have a decanter.
424,5,We love it! It's quick and easy to use. It cleans up well.
425,4,decorated as expected
426,5,These little soda caps are handy.  When ouside they keep bugs out of the can and you can just lift the small lid and drink.  Also use them to seal partial used can and put back in frig.....it will keep the soda for 2-3 days before it starts to degrade.
427,3,"I have Henckles for myself, mine are from Germany. I really like them, a good knife is a valuable tool. I was a bit distressed to see these were from CHINA, what isn't anymore. The ones I sent to my daughter,  a couple are showing rust on them, on Stainless.? I don't know where China gets their steel, scrap yards?. They are better then the ones they had, also from China."
428,5,Great set of dishes. Very well made.
429,5,Fantastic deal! Very nice quality.Over 1/2 the price from postings on competitors sites & kitchen stores
430,5,Wife loves them all. Good quality at reasonable price.
431,5,I bought this pan to use for a cheesecake recipe.  It worked beautifully.  The pan is well made and was very easy to clean up.  I would reccomend it.
432,5,This was a big hit !!!! Great gift idea !!
433,5,Well made. Good controlled pour.
434,2,"I ordered and the large funnel has a crease in the stem, i thought it was a default and returned for replacement.  The replacement was the same.  This prevents you from utilizing the .5 opening, if you were loading anything  round like beads into something the large funnel's crease could get in the way."
435,5,So many wonderful variations to shape your food with.
436,5,Very nice gift.  Great quality.  Packaging was sturdy.
437,1,Just perfect. should be rated 4 stars at least.
438,4,Fine product at good price
439,3,smaller than I thought but it's my fault for not checking
440,5,So perfect embellished for the reception
441,1,"Not happy with these,way too thin the top looks like paper,they are pretty but that's it"
442,5,"Forget out those specialty dipping pots unless it is only you and another individual. Those pots were made for incense. But, the 2 Quart Crock-Pot fits the bill. It is the perfect size for a small gathering. The overall dimensions do not crowd the table for space, which is great when setting out the spread of food.<br /><br />It easily holds a standard Rotel dip or a regular sized bag of meatballs. Skip the less than appetizer size of pots and get one that will do what you need to do.<br /><br />An excellent product."
443,5,Nice quality
444,1,"The cup is really good quality, the only problem is that the lid doesn't really fit in the mug."
445,5,"This decanter is really lovely!  Not only is it super pretty but it does a nice job.  Also, the quality is really great and I have gotten a number of compliments on this decanter.  I would definitely buy Riedel again!"
446,5,Works as it says
447,5,"This juicer is a game changer. I am one of the many people that owned a juicer 20+ years ago and swore NEVER AGAIN will I own a juicer. They were messy, ineffective, did I say messy! Hard to clean. Just not worth it<br /><br />This is at the oppposite end of the spectrum. Multiple juices can be made in a single session with minimal effort required to clean in between. This is so easy to use. The garbage collector.....just line it with a supermarket plastic bag and toss the pulp. The rest of the stuff goes into the dishwasher, if you even need to do that.<br />current fave is broccoli and grapefrult. a bit of ginger and you are in business.  Looks a bit disgusting, but so delicious.<br />I have some knee arthritis and am trying to stay running marathons and have been exploring juicing recipes as anti-inflammatory and I have to say have been very pleased with the delicious and healthy juices we are making<br />The big book of juices by Natalie Savona is a great juice recipe book"
448,4,I use this for unconventional purposes in my jewelry business but glass is important because it won't absorb chemicals and the lid gives a good seal so I don't have to worry about it sloshing out.
449,5,"I was really happy when this was delivered, and it came sooner than expected! The flask is lightweight but of good quality. I can't wait to use it!"
450,5,Love it!
451,5,Easy to install and works well.
452,5,"Love it, works great. A little light weight but works well."
453,5,Showed in time worked out for Christmas thanks
454,5,Thank u
455,4,I just purchased this item and I must admit it is an attractive and effective.  However it does hav a strong epoxy odor when the interior is exposed.  It grinds effortlessly and like every grinder of this design the fine to coarse adjustment is controlled by how tightly the cap is adjusted.  Other than the epoxy odor I can't say anything bad about this grinder.  Anyone serious about cooking and seasoning can't go wrong with this pepper grinder!
456,5,Great
457,5,"Awesome mug, will buy more"
458,2,I love Kameleon pops but beware because color isn't as shown. The color was much darker than expected.
459,5,"Have now used it twice so far.  It was pricey getting the stainless steel with the stainless steel cooking well that is stamped with the word, metal, on the bottom.  If it last much longer than the enamel voated ones, i believe it will be worth it.  My chicken, potatos , carrots, and onions i cooked first time was so tender that the whole chicken split in half when i opened the lid.  The carrots were so soft i couldnt belive it.  My next meal in it was a ham and it cooked very throughly.  Am happy with it."
460,5,"Great purchase, so easy to store and stack! My pantry is finally organized"
461,5,OMG SHE LOVED IT
462,5,Amazing dosai Kallu ( crepe pan). Thank you.
463,4,"Only real complaint is it doesn't keep the coffee as hot as I'd like. Other than that, it makes fine coffee, more conveniently than firing up a large drip coffee maker."
464,5,fits the new 5 cup coffee maker we bought at the same time.  Gift for my brother with stainless steel carafe.
465,3,smaller than I thought it would be
466,2,"It worked really well for a few months, but two months after purchase it has stopped working correctly. It will not calibrate and gives wildly inaccurate readings. I put it in ice water and it reads from 26f to -30f with rapidly changing readings. I changed the battery and it was no different. I will have to find a better thermometer than this one."
467,4,christmas present for my son
468,5,Lasted months and screen still easy to clean & and working perfect
469,5,"These were a gift for our aging parents and they love them. It's comfortable for them when standing at the sink or stove for kitchen time. We've noticed that as they are getting older, they're cutting corners for comfort. Standing uncomfortably for an extra 5 minutes just wasn't happening. With these, they spend more time in the kitchen and eat healthier as they can take more time to prepare food and cleanup. I highly recommend and will be ordering a set for our sink and stove areas."
470,4,Very nice product that delivers the non-slip placement that we were primarily seeking.
471,5,this makes a cast iron pan so much more user friendly!!
472,5,"Attmu Non-Stick 9 Inches Removable Loose Bottom Quiche Pan, Tart Pie Pan, 2 Pack is a great buy! And are a better quality that you would expect for the price. I received a free sample of this product in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />I fancy myself to be the Quiche Queen. It can be a pain to get each serving out of a pie or quiche pan without messing or breaking up the crust. And we all know a good crust is vital to a good quiche. I made a fabulous spinach and mushroom quiche using one of these pans and I was delighted with the results. My quiche was a breeze to remove from the pan, the buttery pastry crust had those wonderful ripples on the end, and was so much easier to cut each serving.<br /><br />In addition to the quiche, I made a cheese cake with a delicate graham cracker crust. Once again, easy to remove from the pan and easy to cut servings.<br /><br />Be sure to grease or spray on baking oil before putting your recipe mixture in the pan. It make removal from the side even easier.<br /><br />Such a great product at such a great price. If you're looking for pans like these, you've found them! Trust me, these pans rock!"
473,5,"These are the absolute best scissors you can ever get for under twenty dollars.  They have a can opener on the end so you don't need your church key any more.  The little serrated thing between the handles helps you open stubborn bottles.  The scissors will actually cut through frozen chicken breasts they're so strong and they'll defeat any blister pack.  Best of all they pop apart with a twist for cleaning and you can put them in the dishwasher.  I've given these as gifts many a time and always get this blank look, but after they've used them, I get thanked.  They are the best!"
474,5,Fantastic
475,1,As it is made of wood..... with in few days I started to see cracks on this........after few days the cracks lead to broken into pieces..... as I contacted customer care they refund me full amount
476,4,I really like these knives. THey're sharp and colorful. Good quality too.
477,4,Very nice set. Single use handles work great. Double use handles very tricky.
478,5,"My Farberware set is nearly 40 years old, and the handles had just about had it.  I was so happy to find these replacement handles.  They fit perfectly!  I could have probably replaced the saucepans with something of lesser quality for not much more than the handles cost, but I'm happy to keep using my original set."
479,5,"I bought these for entertaining which I have not yet done, but unpacking them, washing in dishwasher and putting them away I found them to be sturdy and free of flaws. I bought them because stemware seems to break so easily when entertaining and people are carrying the glasses around. When only serving at table I would use stemware."
480,3,"It's OK, but way, way too expensive!  I just hope it holds up a lot of years without any problems."
481,5,"I like the design.  It kept mold from forming on my veggies, which happened a lot before."
482,1,Cheap quality. Not worth the price.
483,5,I love the automatic shut-off feature of this electric kettle.  I bought this as a replacement because my original electric base was lost when I moved.
484,4,Used to make empanadas in every size.
485,5,"This spinner works great. I am surprised at how dirty lettuce leaves are and this really helps demonstrate that. It seems like there is always stuff in the water that I am glad I am not eating! This salad spinner works well and is very easy to use. It feels very high quality. I have had a similar product in the past that didn’t feel like it would last long and lo and behold it didn’t. This one feels much more durable.<br />I have been on a weight loss kick preparing for the new year and have been eating a lot of salad. This has been very helpful as I always plan ahead and prepare salad in bulk so I need to clean a lot of lettuce. This makes it much easier. I have been really into chop salads like they do at a local sandwich shop here.  I prepare everything in bulk on a cutting board and then chop the lettuce and everything with a [[ASIN:B00MM169AK mezzaluna knife]] which helps speed up the process as there are a ton of ingredients most times. Then I just portion it all out and store it in mason jars, it really works well. This is how I bulk make salad on a busy schedule and still eat healthy most meals. It’s a work in progress but I definitely recommend this salad spinner to speed up the process."
486,5,"I couldn't be happier with this coffee maker!  You want hot coffee rather than just warm?  This is the coffee maker for you.  Fully programmable,  set the number of hours you want it to stay on.  Makes an excellent pot of coffee,  and the hot water reserve is a big bonus.  Doesn't stay on all the time, but just press the button and within seconds you'll have steaming hot water for tea or cocoa.  Program it so that your coffee is ready as soon as you roll out of bed.<br /><br />I've tried a Bunn, but I'm not a fan of luke warm coffee.  In my opinion, this is the best coffee maker you're going to find, and it won't break the bank as far as the price goes.<br /><br />I've only had it for a few days, so I can't speak on reliability,  but if it poops out after 6 months I'll buy another one."
487,5,NEEDED & EXCELLENT ITEM!
488,4,These filters fit perfectly in my new Black & Decker DCM600B 5-Cup Coffeemaker that I just purchased from Amazon.
489,5,This is the second one I have bought.  Love it
490,5,"Great Product with a Great Price.  Saves me $7.86 a day, paid for it self in 5 days"
491,3,have not tried it or even opened the box yet
492,3,"Photo of product is misleading, it appears as if the tools come in a nice reusable bag, they came in a cheap plastic bag that really cannot be reused..  Poor quality control.  3 tools are missing the plunger spring and 2 that have the spring hanging out of the tool. The price is less expensive than buying each separately.  I purchased these for my grand-daughter to use with a play dough kit I am putting together as a Christmas gift. I am disappointed that 5 tools are unusable."
493,4,Loads of fun for watching movies with your kids!
494,5,"This seems to have everything I need to start learning to can. I may report back as soon as I get going. (Unless, of course, I poison myself first.)"
495,5,Love It !!!
496,5,We use this almost everyday and love it. It won't fit a turkey but for everyday needs its perfect and gets the job done. Looks great on the counter too.
497,5,Great
498,3,"The idea is great, but the silicone on the top of spatula has started to break."
499,5,The Whirley-Pop is now a favorite in our house. We officially hate microwave popcorn due to this wonderful item. It's easy to use and clean.
500,5,excellent for use as gift tags on my craft paper wrapped presents
501,4,Excellent quality. Worked for us in smuggling liquor on cruise. Picture is misleading....we only received the 32oz and 8oz sizes. Otherwise I would have rated this a 5.
502,5,"I must admit, I don't use them to bake cakes.  I heat up everything I buy at Trader Joe's, etc.  Great size, fits perfectly in my small wall oven.  I have two, and can have both in there, cooking meat and a side.  Amazing.  These don't warp and cool down quickly."
503,5,Well balanced with beautiful finish.  Love this pattern and the quality is exceptional.  Stands up well to dishwasher cleaning.  Very pleased with this flatware.
504,5,These are fantastic. I will be ordering more after the holidays.
505,4,I love it for my spices!!!
506,5,Very good fit in the hand & well balanced.
507,5,Love this!
508,5,Better than I expected. I like the collapsable feature for easy storage. Nice and deep to hold food and drinks.
509,5,"I see that others have complained about this leaking, but that may be a defective piece- mine works great! I don't mind that it's trickier filling than a glass one- I don't like storing a glass one on the counter, as light deteriorates the olive oil in a glass container. For keeping the oil fresher, this is perfect. And stylish!"
510,1,way smaller than expect
511,1,The remote doesn't stay in sync for longer then two minutes.  Very disappointed.
512,5,"I'm a coffee nerd and enjoy hand grinding fair trade beans and brewing with Chemex, Hario V-60, french press, Techivorm, Eva Solo, Kalita Wave, Sowden, Areo Press, & Bee House. Hario Paperless is my new go to!!! Pour with circular motion starting in middle (let bloom for 30 seconds) and don't hit the sides. Go slow. Magically, the coffee itself with form into a filter! The oils will come through to deepen the flavor into a rich, hot, low-sediment satisfying cup. Excellent brew method with no paper waste or hassle and easy clean-up. Another bravo for Hario!!!"
513,5,hit of party
514,1,This arrived with no label.  The first time I tried to use it I could tell it was warped because it &#34;rocked&#34; all over my stove.  Very unhappy and am returning.  Will not order this line again.
515,5,Love the many uses - we use one for removing toast and bagels from the toaster.  They work well and are well made.
516,2,I've had this scale for 6 weeks and have had to replace the batteries once and the display is already deteriorating.  Too much trouble to return.  Will look for a new brand.  It looks good but did not hold up at all.
517,1,This kettle has false reviews. It is made out regular glass.  The handle came out on the first try and I almost cut my finger. I would not recommend this item. Buyers beware.
518,5,Great kitchen tool
519,1,These arrived and were too smelly to put out!
520,5,My sisters told me I couldn't find this except is a set. Fooled them. These are absolutely the best measuring cups and withstand the dishwasher and those tumbles to the floor. And best of all you can read the amount and it is light. I wouldn't use anything else.
521,5,Protects us from our long slicing knife when it is stored in the drawer.
522,5,A definite 5 stars. It has a cool factor that's hard to rate
523,5,Amazing for breakfast on the go !
524,5,Great product
525,5,"[[VIDEOID:3d965033fd949c1b3ff2ea0fdbb2b654]]As you'll witness on video I used the dinner of chuck steak center cut usda choice beef as the real life example in the review the instructions I followed with the tenderizer is short and easy I washed it when first delivered to me and includes a protective plastic cover for safe storage.  I BEAT up the steak and avoided hitting the bone but lightly with it on a wooden cutting board flipped it over repeated like the other side was done that's all and your finished presto.  You've<br /><br />got some nicely tender food  without getting stuck in between teeth which is just right in time for me because I just left the dentist last week monday  and food  cooks quicker with this kitchen gadget and please do adjust cooking time accordingly ok ; )It tenderizes -meat - poultry or fish -pork chops you know steak from my video duck and goose  prior to marinating, which allows spices and flavor to be absorbed quickly and deeply.<br /><br />Tenderizes the meat without changing the flavor , and has the 48 stainless steel razor sharp blades that penetrate any cut of meat with ease and makes the toughest cut of meat into a juicy, flavorful, masterpiece<br />Easy to clean; wash with soap and warm water not over 175 degrees fahrenheit to avoid damage of plastic material . Tenderizer is top-rack dishwasher safe and keep away from kids .<br /><br />Pros: Gave my meat tenderness and fast cooking to eat.<br /><br />Cons: None it works .<br /><br />Color: White<br />Shipping Weight: 11.2 ounces and came Super super fast and is Courtesy of  F&W !!<br /><br />Disclosure:  Item offered free  in exchange for a review, I'am open to negative and positive comment's"
526,5,I had the smaller SodaStream and loved it. Actually loved it so much that upgrading to a model that can fizz 130 liters was a no brainer. This model is so easy to use and it’s FAST.
527,5,"When my first Nutribullet croaked due to liquids getting down into the motor (user error), I thought I would have to shell out a ton of money to replace it.  I stumbled upon this and couldn't be happier with my purchase.  In my experience, this item is the real deal (not a knock off), comes with a warranty, and works wonderfully.  :)"
528,4,"I have to say I met a incomplete, it must be a coincidence, customer service processing quickly, I am very satisfied!New replacement glass insulation is very good"
529,4,"Cant beat for the price, can clean easily."
530,5,loved this product
531,5,"Best thing ever! I might have gotten carried away and bought the 5 quart instead of 4 quart, but this machine is perfect. Really love it!"
532,5,Beautiful and unusual!  Perfect.
533,5,durable
534,5,"Well made mugs perfect for dark & story's and Moscow mules. Very reasonably priced, fast shipping and quality workmanship. These mugs are very pretty to look at while you're sipping a tasty cocktail."
535,5,"I have not decorated with this cutter yet, however I have cut some cookies out, it's a perfect cutter."
536,5,"Excellent containers. Easy to use, easy to clean, pours well."
537,5,Its a tamper. Hard to find a bad one.
538,5,I originally bought the stainless steel K-cups but I bought the brown plastic ones for my daughter. I use an espresso grind coffee and the plastic ones seem to filter that grind of coffee better.
539,5,These make the best ice cubes.  They make cubes that are approximately 2 x 2 x 2 inches. The cubes are really easy to remove from the tray once frozen.  And they take a long time to melt.<br /><br />I actually tried to use a couple of these in my green smoothie this morning but my blender wouldn't crush them effectively.  They did work to make my smoothie cold. Even an hour after drinking it there is still a 1 x 1 x 1 inch cube of ice left in the bottom of my cup.<br /><br />While you can stack these you can't fill them to the top if you want to do so. You have to leave about 1/3 of an inch of space at the top of the tray or water will spill out when you put the 2nd tray on top.  Learned that the hard way.<br /><br />I received a sample of this product in exchange for an honest review.
540,5,"Daughter likes it.  It fits two themos containers and also has room for something on the bottom.  I like that it has two storage areas.  I use one for cold items, and the other for hot."
541,2,"don't buy a nuwave through the mail , you can pick one up at a local department store for less. My husband purchased buy one get one free, well it is not free. You have to pay the shipping charges for both units and extra for the 2nd unit's additional accessories which all adds to be much more than if you purchased 2 units going to a local department store. don't forget about shipping charges! So if you have to return the product it is much easier going back to the store than through the mail.  More I use it the more I wish I didn't purchase one at all!"
542,3,I liked this coffee maker just fine.  Until it stopped working.  It was approx 1 year old and it would no longer brew a carafe.  There is no way to get it fixed or get replacement parts. Tells you right on the instructions not to take out any screws.  So it was a pretty expensive coffee maker to only last a year.
543,5,My grandson is a swimmer on his high school team and was THRILLED when I gave him this for his birthday!!!
544,5,Good quality - looks great on counter
545,5,"I love this cup! The art on the inside is every bit as beautiful and vivid as in the picture, and it does a great job of keeping cold drinks cold. The only thing to keep in mind is that you CANNOT submerge the cup when washing it or put it in the dishwasher. You'll ruin the paper inside if you do."
546,3,Love that it is non-stick BUT it moves around on the pot lip whenever you stir the contents and the handles on either side get hot really fast making it necessary to use potholders which can be a bit unwieldy.  Wish it had grips on the outside to keep it from slipping around on the pot and silicone covering fo rhte rim/handles.  It would be perfect then.
547,5,"Our family lives pulled pork, shredded chicken and anything else we can cook in the crockpot. I was continually grousing about how tedious shredding the meat was with two forks. These claws make a tough job easy. Being able to use your forearm rather than relying on your fingers to pull the meat apart is a true benefit. They're also great for lifting the meat out of the pot. And my kids love the &#34;claws that make daddy look like  Wolverine&#34;. I highly recommend these, they're a bargain at twice the price."
548,4,"I bought this set of twelve to give as Christmas gifts. They are pretty nice spoons for the price. They're not as smooth as a nice quality more expensive spoons, but I plan on attaching 2 with pancake mix and syrup for some families. So these are a great buy for that purpose and needing so many."
549,5,very goog
550,5,Good time shipping works well... waiting for my results...
551,2,"After around 2 weeks, of normal use, they started all have a ring of corrosion for where the glasses set (I wiped them down after each use).  It would look very cool if they actually rusted and corroded like a manhole cover on the street, but no, it's just a boring white scale."
552,3,it's small and the incense doesn't fit in it
553,1,Made muffins and these stuck to them. Every time.
554,5,Works well.  Easy to clean.  Cooks evenly.  I like it.
555,5,I love my breadbox!! I always love my shopping experience with Amazon. Thanks
556,2,"Has a very bad burning smell when turned on, almost like burnt plastic."
557,5,Can't beat the price for these elegant glasses.  Arrived very quickly.
558,5,"As described, new, in manufacturer's box."
559,4,Great cutting board.  Nice size that gives you room to work but also fits in the dishwasher.  Mine arrived with a flaw/gash on the gray part but it still works.  Recommended for sure!  So much easier than waiting for a PC party.
560,3,My hamburgers stick to the bottom:(
561,5,"My kids, 3rd and preschool, have been using their lunchbox for 2 months now.  We love them.  Great design.  I only wish they were slightly bigger to hold not only their lunch options, but a Capri Sun or something similar.  Not quite big enough for that.  My kids, even being young, can work the zippers all by themselves after a couple practice runs before school started.  Keeps things much colder with an ice pack than our other &#34;traditional&#34; insulated lunch boxes we've tried in the past.  I'd buy these again for sure.  I bought the Rubbermaid LunchBlox Kid's Tall Lunch Box Kit to use with them, and it all fits fine with room to add a couple snack bags of other foods."
562,5,Ok
563,5,"A little pricey but it is a quality product verses some other cheaper ones we have purchased and have trashed ,they have withstood our dishwasher and still look new. As they say , you get what you pay for.."
564,5,Cute gift!
565,5,I just received my cameo mold today & it's very detailed. It's a nice size. The mold itself is nearly 2 inches long & 1 1/2  inch wide.The finished product is just under 1 1/2 inches long & just over 1 inch wide. So that would be kind of a large cameo for jewelry making. I love it!
566,4,Nice . My 4 yrs daughter can open it without any problems.
567,5,They almost remove themselves!  Definitely recommend.
568,5,"The skillet works well, is a nice size for a family of four to six.  It is easy to clean.  It holds the temperature perfectly.  We love it."
569,5,"I have been using my five tray excalibur now for about four weeks and it's great.  It dehydrates about 6 servings or more of one individual item at one time, although it seems like a long time for the drying process at low temperatures for like rice or jalapeno peppers, rice only takes 5 hours and jalapeno peppers take 14 hours, still it's quiet and works well.  I hope its lasts longer than the warranty lasts.  It seems a very durable and long lasting dehydrator."
570,5,A+++++
571,3,"Don't use very often and have cleaned it twice but it still only produces 70% of the pot which is little.  I guess I loose water in the steam process.  Next time I am just buying a full size, this will do for now."
572,5,"i make homemade ice cream with this and it is so easy! all you have to do is make sure the bowl has been in the freezer for a while, then once you have your ice cream base prepared, you pour it in, put in the mixing arm, and turn it on. the machine does all the mixing for you. it is a bit loud, but it is so easy to use, and comes with a recipe booklet for beginners who don't know any recipes for ice cream. definitely a good buy for people who want to make their own delicious, custom ice cream!"
573,5,Sturdy shelf. Easy to install. Great adjustability to customize to fit whatever you want to put in it. You'll likely want to use your own hardware to hang it.
574,5,"I bought one Multiclad Pro pan and now I will not buy any other stainless cookware. The quality of these pans is amazing, and they are beautiful in their own right. They heat faster and more evenly than lesser pans and they're very easy to clean."
575,4,Works well
576,5,"I've used Boos Block Board Cream with Beeswax for years and it has kept my butcher blocks looking beautiful. The ingredients are straightforward and all are excellent wood conditioners. It's a good product but daily expensive for what you get in the small tube. I've been making my own according to the ingredients to save a little money. My wood still looks good. Whichever way you choose to go, just be sure to do it. you can't leave wood unconditioned and expect it to last."
577,1,"I was very disappointed with this model. I had a Bunn years ago ( probably 1990-99) approx. and LOVED it so I tried to research the newer ones and decided on this one. The main reason I hate it is because the heating plate is so ridiculously HOT it cooks the coffee to the point of bitter in a matter of minutes. By the time I drink the first cup and return for a refill it has already started to cook it. Even the first cup is not as good as I remembered with the older model I use to have. I have started putting a ball canning ring under the pot to lift it off the burner and it helps but I shouldn't have to do this in the first place. I am only trying to use it to justify spending this much money on a coffeemaker, once I feel I have used it enough to pay for it I will Defiantly get a different coffeemaker."
578,5,"Let his bag is wonderful. It's large and made of good material. I'm a teacher and as well as a Literature nerd, and I take this bag to work with me. I love it!"
579,4,works great
580,1,"I should have known better. It looks cool, but is very cheap. It broke after the 4th or 5th time using it."
581,5,"inexpensive, good food storage. Came quickly and well packed."
582,5,Great product
583,5,Really love it
584,4,This grater is awesome.
585,4,Nice design and functions well with a good feel and sound when depressing the toasting lever. But I would expect that the darkest setting would really be dark. I had to retoast on setting 2 to get english muffins to a toasted look. I put a black dot on the knob as an easier to see pointer.
586,5,Great product and does the job perfectly
587,2,"They don't work well on some types of bags, but mostly they are fine."
588,5,Perfect jar for muddling fruit or other produce to mix with vodka or club sods  for a refreshing drink.
589,3,Great product. I wish the white bar was of a metal construction vs plastic.
590,1,Very cheap. The suction cups didn't suction. Tried a potato and the white handle broke off. The end that grips the veggie tore it up without actually gripping. Tried to par-boil the potato to make it softer to cut with no luck. It's going back to the store.
591,5,These are great straws and easy to clean with the long scrubber that comes with them!
592,5,"I recently bought one, and so far am very very happy with it.  It is a great size for me, you can cook 2 giant pancakes at once or 4 smaller ones.  you can just unplug the electrical cable and throw the whole thing in the dishwasher to clean it (doesn't get any easier than that...) and it's a convenient size and shape for storage.  It doesn't have a big &#34;footprint&#34;, lays pretty flat, and is small so it stores very easily.  And of course the most important thing... it really helps to make great pancakes.  It seems to heat very evenly, and it's great to be able to precisely control the temperature, relative to doing it on the stove for example.  I'm very very happy with this item!"
593,5,GOT THESE FOR WORK MEETINGS. WORKS GREAT AND HAS MADE MY TASK A BIT EASIER!
594,4,Picture shows 2 but you are actually only getting 1.
595,5,Works amazing!  Love it
596,5,A gift and was loved
597,5,There are no pieces of All Clad I don't like. My oldest granddaughter will inherit my whole set as these will last a lifetime.
598,1,I bought this looking for a safe non-toxic pot but it wore out within months.  The interior scrapped away.
599,5,I love it cooks meats of any kind to tender perfection wish I had purchased one years ago...thanks granite ware !
600,5,"As long as you have a pan big enough to hold it, it is wonderful.  Works very well."
601,4,"These feel sturdy, and have held up so far. I really like the colors, and I appreciate that they are BPA free."
602,5,Christmas gift. Great quality!
603,3,No real complaints
604,5,I wouldn't bake cookies without these pans.  They are amazing.  Easy to use and clean.  I haven't had a burnt cookie since I got them years ago.  I just ordered a set of them for my friend who loves to bake Christmas cookies and has a birthday coming up.  I highly recommend these &#34;air-cushioned&#34; pans.  .
605,4,I like the fact that I don't have to buy filters for it. But I also don't like the coffee it makes.<br /><br />I ended up buying a coffee press and i love the coffee and tea I get from that.
606,4,Worked as expected
607,5,"Attractive; good size compartment for salt; the design that keeps salt from getting on the table is awesome! Have had it for only a couple months, so can't say much for durability."
608,5,We had to get rid of our garbage disposal. I dreaded how we would handle our garbage. This was a perfect solution ! It is attractive and the size is adequate for a weeks worth of garbage.  It has been odorless. We keep under the sink but this is attractive enough to leave on a countertop.
609,5,Great coasters!
610,5,"These are small cups, perfect for sipping tea.  Well made, nice interior finish, nice color."
611,5,best cast iron pots we own!
612,4,"rust formed on the inside, love it otherwise, but will see if it can be cleaned up and keep using it."
613,5,Exactly as described.  I love em!
614,5,"Great transaction, highly recommend."
615,5,"the pink straps are a bit much, i cut mine off and my daughter loves it!!!"
616,2,"The pendant is okay, but I highly dislike the LARGE plastic fake chain"
617,5,We have had our knife set for over 7 years and most of the knifes are dull. The set came with a sharpener but i never felt like it was doing anything and it didnt feel very safe. This is great bc the knifes arent out in the open going back in forth. This works great and we will be able to get more years out of our knife set!
618,3,"very thin material, feels like it's going to break in my hand. Design is great though."
619,1,"I used it on about six tomatoes before the blade separated from the handle. Contacted the company by email, they never responded."
620,5,"This is an amazing invention! We recently took 2 of these with us on a car trip. We like to stay in suites when we travel and the hotels we stay in frequently have microwave ovens, but that's of no use to us - we do not microwave our food (it zaps the nutrients out of your food and does funky stuff to its molecular structure).<br /><br />We love to explore new restaurants when we travel and often are not able to finish the whole meal. Rather than waste the delicious food, we take the leftovers back to the room. It's great to be able to enjoy the leftovers from a particularly nice meal in the comfort of your hotel room - for a late night snack, or breakfast/lunch the next day. Without a way to heat the food, we'd nibble on it cold, but with this neat little device and a Pyrex Storage 6-Cup Rectangular Dish (http://www.amazon.com/Pyrex-Storage-6-Cup-Rectangular-Plastic/dp/B0000CFTPA/), which fits perfectly, we can heat up those yummy leftovers and truly enjoy them.<br /><br />I recommend 1 set (1 Mini-Mac personal portable oven and 1 Pyrex Storage 6-Cup Rectangular Dish) per person so you can heat up your leftovers at the same time.<br /><br />We have a long road trip coming up. We're going to bring our portable ovens along in the car with a car ac adapter (we have one of these: http://www.amazon.com/outlets-inverter-adapter-notebook-MRI3011BU/dp/B004MDXS0U/) so we can heat some food up while we're driving. It beats eating questionable food at a rest stop!"
621,5,This is a great idea.  Put it in the freezer at night.  Pack it the next morning.  Your lunch stays cold all day.  It's even cold when you bring it home in the afternoon.  Cute pattern as well.
622,5,I made a big mess melting beeswax & infusing oil with this pan & it easily came clean.... Wish I could say the same about the kitchen! Lol
623,4,I use every day it is vert confortable
624,5,Great gift.
625,5,"Low noise, good grind quality, good bean feed"
626,5,"This knife is so sharp its awesome! I bought it for my mom as a gift and she was cutting a loaf bread with it and she didn't realize how well it slices and ended up cutting through her finger tip. If you give this to someone who is used to dull, crappy knives, tell them to be careful."
627,5,This is a great way to cook corn on the cob.
628,2,Found out after purchasing that this item will not work on a glass top stove. Returned it.
629,5,Excellent for homemade soaps
630,5,"This is a small appliance that does not take up a lot of room – great for those of us who have small kitchens.  It does not require a lot of counter space when in use.  The unit folds up securely and can be set on its side for easy storage.  It has a handle.  It would probably not be a wise selection for someone cooking for a large family as the surface area is relatively small.<br /><br />I made two steaks the other day, and it was perfect.  So much easier and faster than cooking them on the stove.  And they were frozen.  I just opened up the Griddler (it lays flat when opened), and turned the setting to heat up both the top and bottom to “sear.”  It takes a few minutes to heat up, but there is a light on the knob – red when heating up, green when it has reached the proper temperature.  I put the steaks on, closed the top, and let the Griddler do its thing.  After a bit, I turned the heat down to finish cooking the interior of the steaks.<br /><br />Perfect results.  Very little splatter.  Quick cleanup.<br /><br />The top and bottom each have removable two-sided plates.  One side is flat and the other has grill ridges.  It’s easy to change them.  I wiped the grease and gunk off the plates with a paper towel, and then a little soap and water on the plates and around the Griddler.  Clean in two minutes.  There is a drip tray, but I don’t usually have drippings.<br /><br />Great for pork chops, too.<br /><br />To use it as a griddle, just keep it open and flat.  You can adjust the heat for the top and bottom separately, or only use one side.  I’ve done pancakes and bacon and eggs, but only for one or two people.  This is not a huge item.<br /><br />When closed, the lid floats to allow for the height of the tallest item cooking.<br /><br />Highly recommended for apartment dwellers, singles, and couples."
631,4,ok
632,5,My daughter loves it.
633,5,"Just what I needed to store my k-cups. Very sturdy, the drawer opens easily and holds a lot."
634,2,The indicator light does not go off when it reaches a certain temp!
635,4,I like this as it was what I was looking for
636,5,"I LOVE my Le Creuset Skillet! I was debating between a 9 inch,10 inch, and 12 inch (I typically cook for two) and am very glad I chose the 9 inch. Doesn't take up too much space and is just heavy enough (I think even the 10 inch might be a little too heavy for me). My mom had a heavier cast-iron that I dreaded using but with this one I look forward to cooking!<br /><br />Although they say it doesn't require any additional seasoning, I agree with the other reviews that additional seasoning may help....but I use it without seasoning and it works perfectly fine (just not as &#34;non-stick&#34; as a plain cast iron with seasoning).<br /><br />The sides are perfect for pouring saucy liquids left in the pan onto the meat/fish/etc."
637,5,Great product
638,5,"This is my second pan and I will reorder them as often as necessary. This pan is great for micro-waving hot dogs to chicken, grilled cheese to pork chops. The only disappointing part was that steak did not turn out good."
639,5,I've had a vacuvin for almost 10 years... amazing that the pump and little rubber stoppers are still working.  It works great - substantially extends the life of bottles once opened.  I can't think of too many products I've had for so long.
640,5,perfect for deep frying
641,5,FITS GREAT
642,5,Great toaster oven makes perfect toast!  The oven is also great for baking and heating up meals.
643,5,Quality product for making shakes
644,3,So far it works but isn't sharp enough on ripe nectarines.  You are probably better off with a knife.
645,3,"These do take longer to freeze than what I'm used to. I love the colorful appearance, but I was a little disappointed with the size, they were described perfect for lunch box, but 2 squares are the same size a piece of bread. I was expecting a bigger item for the price. But they do work very well, they need a full 12 hours to freeze completely. I would purchase these again."
646,5,"so cute and boils water very fast. Although there is a temperature control, I personally haven't really noticed the difference but I'm sure there is. Leaving the temp setting all the way up is fine since it boils so quickly anyway."
647,4,True to picture and quick delivery
648,4,Great grill. Use this over my stove top burners and gets nice grill marks on burgers or hot dogs!
649,5,"I love this bag.  It fits my Singer Confidence Quilter machine perfectly with room in the side pocket to store the instruction book, extra quilting supplies, etc."
650,5,"This is the best apple/pear slicer ever! Sharp blades are fabulous, but the bottom part that pops it up is the best. Plus it acts like a tray after your fruit is sliced. I have 2. One for home and one for work. I'm getting a 3rd one to keep in the car for after school snacks."
651,5,If u are in the market for a toaster oven get this one.  Dont compromise.  I will expect a check in the mail from Breville for this ringing recommendation.
652,5,It fits in a half sheet pan perfectly.
653,5,"It's the TARDIS mug so naturally it's awesome. But serious, well made and I love it."
654,2,"Size is not good, too small"
655,5,The folding foot that raises this above the cutting board makes this my choice above those with out the folding foot. Also the storage case is a definite plus
656,5,"My niece's daughter was taught how to make pie crust from these and loved it so much. The only problem is, we can't find any more. Can anyone help us find them for sale anywhere?"
657,5,These glasses were exactly what I wanted and were in perfect condition.
658,5,"Dam good cup.  Coffee stays hot, cold stays cold, enough said.  Only minor complaint is the lack of colors for the cups and the lid needs some studs or something on it to make it easier to grip and unscrew it when your cleaning your cup.  It's a bit slippery but nothing I can't work with."
659,3,"I like the bottle it self but not even a week of using this bottle the straw cap stopped working. The straw would be attached and the mouth piece would be exactly on for the straw function to work, but water would not suck through. I think I would choose the open cap next time."
660,3,"The buzzer is very loud - great when in another room.  However, it still continues to 'cook' and doesn't seem to automatically shut off.  Had no problem with cooking eggs per the instructions for hard boiled eggs - the only ones I generally use cooker for.  Very hard to read the lines on the measuring beaker but making do.  Sure beats boiling in pan of water!!!!"
661,5,Does what it is supposed to do. Thanks.
662,5,Very good quality...
663,5,"I love this sandwich maker. You can put a small pancake in it a english muffin a bagel and then you just add a egg, cheese meat of your choice but make sure it is cooked bacon candian bacon ham sausage. Only 4 minutes and it is done. It is great."
664,2,The top is hard to line up when replacing it on bottle.
665,5,My husband and son love to cook and were happy to try this out a few days after it arrived. They loved it. This is a high quality item; it arrived on time and was well packed.
666,5,Nice
667,5,Good product!
668,5,This bottle works great! So far haven't dropped it. Ice cubes stay longer in it too. Makes water taste normal than from plastic bottles. That's why I bought it to save wasting plastic. I recycle everything and weekly have 1 bag of trash only.
669,5,"Works! I used this for traveling, just heat water and pour. Quick, easy one person, one cup."
670,5,Great quality and price
671,5,I really like these because I can get down in the spice jars.  Also can read what the measurement is on the spoon.  So often it is hard to read.  I really like the measuring Spoons.
672,2,There are no direction on how to use it.  I was very disappointed.
673,5,"I ordered the lunch bag, and it made its way to Hawaii very quickly - I'm very happy with it and thanks to the seller!"
674,5,These were a gift and both people love them.
675,5,So glad I checked the reviews. I have had cheap ice trays crack and I have had this one for almost a year. Just a slight twist to the tray and the cubes drop out effortlessly. Very well made and I won’t be leaving them in the freezer when I move. They are coming with me! LOL
676,5,Received as pictured and on time
677,4,Nice salad plates
678,5,SMALLER KIT NO PROBLEM- THIS IS FOR YOU !!!TOTALLY AS MUST HAVE (LOVE IT) BUT BUY EXTRA HOOKS AND I BOUGHT MORE STRAP TOGGLES comes with two need two more  I HAD NO STUDS WHERE I WANTED RACK WILL HOLD AS MUCH AS YOU CAN PUT ON IT.VERY STURDY *****
679,5,WONDERFUL !
680,5,"After considering more expensive manual burr grinders, I decided to listen to the reviews of this one and go with it. I'm really really liking it so far. Easy and ergonomic to use, straightforward to adjust the grind size, and does good, consistent grind. It takes a minute or less to grind enough for one cup of coffee (made with an aeropress) in the morning.<br /><br />Basically, this hit a sweet spot in terms of price, ease of use, and quality of grind—big upgrade from the electric blade grinder I was using before, but doesn't break the bank like other burr grinders."
681,1,"I've bought lots of Debbie Meyer bags, and this are absolutely and positively FAKE.  No doubt or question at all.  If you want to spend $10 for green bags, go buy some kitchen garbage bags instead of these.  You'll get WAY more, and they'll do exactly the same thing.  But they will NOT work like Debbie Meyer bags.  I'd like to let the actual manufacturer of DM bags know of this counterfeit scam so they might sue this seller for everything they can get.  What a lying, cheating, dishonest, scumbag of a company.  Amazon should read these reviews once in awhile and take action.  All that would be needed in this case is to send the real DM mfg'ing company a sample of these counterfeit bags and the rest would be history.  Thanks for NOTHING other than making my wallet lighter."
682,5,Sharpest blades ever.  Do. NOT run through washing machine.  HAND WASH ONLY
683,4,"I ordered this product because I have the exact same one and I love it and wanted another.  The only downside is that when it arrived it was blue, not red. It doesn't say anywhere that the color wouldn't be red."
684,5,We use this grill often and enjoy it very much.  It is easy to use and clean and allows us to create some luscious vegan sandwiches.
685,5,Great. Simple. Kids love them.
686,5,Great trays cover helps with stacking and keeps order out and no sticking if you don't overfill just twist . Cool idea and functional...love
687,5,Great price.  Pretty & sturdy.  Pictures are durable with no fading or chipping.
688,5,Works as described.  Liter has a solid bottom (non mesh)
689,2,Really expansive for cheaper plastic I found the exact same set in a drug store for $1.50
690,5,"I always wanted a cake topper like this for a wedding cake...well, it'll be cupcakes for us! Regardless, it's perfect"
691,5,"Originally purchased this particular product because of its higher ratings, which it has lived up to. I really like the consistent fine mist and its convenience.....has basically eliminated the constant need to clean my silicone basting brushes. I purchased this product around 2 years ago to use for olive oil and liked it so much I decided to purchase two more.....one for canola oil and one for infused olive oil (not all oil misters have the infusion ability so this is an additional feature of this particular product). I would have purchased additional misters sooner but read that a BPA-free Mastrad mister was expected soon so waited for it. There are health benefits too as this mister cuts the amount of oil used. After each application I unscrew the lid just a bit to release any retained pressure as I have read this helps extend the life of a mister.....mine get used a lot and my first mister is working just like it did when I first got it."
692,5,Excellent thermos!
693,2,"We like dark roast coffee.  We have been using Starbucks Italian roasted beans, and the &#34;formula&#34; is put in 6 cups of water and set the pot for 10 cups, so the machine grinds enough beans, and set it on dark aroma, although I'm not sure this is a real thing.  The coffee still comes out tasting like it came from a Mr Coffee machine and obviously, if you have more than 2 or 3 people wanting coffee, you have to make a couple of pots.  Also, if you forget to put in the basket that holds the grinds and the filter, you don't get a warning...it will brew coffee all over the counter, floor, etc.  For the price, there should be more features and it should make better coffee!  We loved the Breville coffee maker we had, but our well water would require weekly cleanings because of the computerized mechanisms inside the machine, or some such thing.  After returning 3 machines that quit working, they finally told us this is what we should have been doing.  But if you have normal water without a lot of minerals, try the Breville for a little more money.  Seriously great machine.  And if you try making coffee without the filter basket, it beeps at you!!"
694,5,This is excellent!!!  I use mine multiple times a week!!!  I absolutely love it!!!  I especially love the fact that it has a glass lid so I can see what is happening!
695,1,"I do not like this at all, the edges are sharp, it doesn't turn very easily. But, it also came with no receipt, no paper to return it with... so.. looks like I'm stuck once again!! Going to a store to buy one so I can actually see it BEFORE I buy it and am stuck with it"
696,4,"I like them!  They stick a little but seem to be getting better as I use them.  I do not wash them in soap and water but choose to season them with olive oil.  Sometimes they leak a small amount but that is just the difference between the pan and ring, a small pressure on the handle until the egg cooks a little solves the issue."
697,5,"Great containers, no BPA on the lids. My lids fit fine. Always use Pyrex for leftovers."
698,5,I love these lids.  They are the greatest!
699,2,Product was fine but it didn't work with my model.
700,5,Works great for the money
701,5,"love it, cook all my meals here, boiled and been dropping weight naturally just eating healthier."
702,5,"Great new griddle , Ilove the way it cooks , quick and easy to use"
703,4,Great for cold beverages
704,5,Good quality and easy to clean. Very good product .I am really pleased with this product.
705,5,I just LOVE this! It gave me a new relationship with water!! I put strawberries and mint or lemon cucumber mint in it  and its so tasted and refreshing! I don't normally give reviews on things but this is worth every penny. Much cheaper than it was at bed bath and beyond too! Getting one of these for my friends bdays!
706,5,Good quality. Holds a lot of k cups in a small space. Very happy.
707,5,Works great
708,5,Simple solution to measuring food portions! The tare feature and easy unit button is great for measuring exactly what you need
709,5,"These are a must have for anyone who craves tomato sandwiches all summer long.  The are good for slicing avacadoes and hard boiled eggs, too  I received one as a gift several ars ago and ordered some to share with my family and firiends."
710,5,"This mug is heavy and feels substantial, not delicate.  I feel like the &#34;peace&#34; quote on it is made just for me."
711,3,Seems to be working fine; my only complaint is that it seems to be staining somewhat. We have only washed it by hand but the finish seems a little off.
712,1,"I bought  this specifically because drip coffee doesn't stay on the grounds long enough for that good old fashioned taste<br />I used to get from perked coffee.  Lo and behold, neither does this--they made it perk so fast it is not even good as drip.<br />will buy stove top percolator.  Disappointed!!!"
713,5,I tested this plate several times and I put frozen Italian sausage on the plate and several on a plate and within 15 minutes the ones on the thawing plate where ready to cook but the one on the dinner plate where still frozen. AMAZING !!!!!!!!!
714,5,Quickly makes smoothies that are not chunky with ice or pieces of fruit. Consistent results. Good for pasta sauce as well.
715,5,"What a great baking sheet. I purchased a set just a few months ago that did not stand up at all. I tried this sheet pan tonight to bake a couple of things and my baked goods came out perfectly. This is a nice big, and sturdy pan and the lip around the pan makes it much easier to grasp and handle. Very happy with this item!"
716,5,"Smaller, so it does not take up too much counter space, easy to clean and very effective - love it an highly reccommend it"
717,5,GREAT PRODUCT!!!! MADE TOUGH AND LAST FOR EVER. TO GO WITH THE STAINLESS PAN FOR A GLASS TOP KITCHEN STOVE....
718,4,Installed in lid after lubing with Dow Corning 111(non drying).  Fit like a glove and no leaks after tightening hand tight.  Have removed and reinstalled twice with satisfactory results.  If it lasts more than one summer it will be better than the original o-ring.  Fast easy ordering and it arrived when expected.  If need be I'll order again.
719,3,unit looks nice but lucky if filters last a week - bought 4 spare filters - have 2 left - filters are a joke - do not recommend
720,3,"These glasses look nice and are about the size I expected.  I did think the glass would be a little thicker and more sturdy based on the photo and the base of the glass.  I wouldn't call them &#34;flimsy&#34; -- and I've had no issues putting them in the dishwasher -- but I do think a slightly thicker glass, especially at the bowl, would feel better in the hand.<br /><br />Are they a true improvement in the drinking experience over a straight-sided glass?  Meh.  Maybe I'm just not enough of a whiskey wank to tell that much of a difference.  They do boost the ability to smell aroma.  And since aroma is a huge component to taste, then I guess the shape does what it's supposed to do.  If you could rig up some way that I couldn't see or feel the glass and had to go on taste alone though....I doubt I could tell that much difference.  They certainly look more elegant, however, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.  As a bonus, they are affordable enough that I can still buy something to put into them and won't cry a river if one should break."
721,5,My 18 month old grandson is enamored with Sponge Bob and I could not locate a dinner set in my shopping area.  I told him it would be a month before he got it but he brought me a package from UPS a few days latter.  Now everything matches.
722,5,"A good item for Hello Kitty fans, this was a gift for Easter for her Hello Kitty collection, so it was very well liked."
723,4,"These cups were what I expected and look just like the picture.  They hold up pretty well and are mostly durable.  One cup was cracked upon arrival but the company seem to have noticed before shipping it and threw in an extra order of cups to make up for it.  These cups will do just fine, especially for the price."
724,5,"We love these cups. They don't break, hold a lot of liquid and even look inviting. They take up lots of space, but if you stack them, it's not so bad."
725,5,THE ART WORK IS GREAT AND THE LID STAYS ON VERY TIGHTLY.  I WOULD RECOMMEND HIGHLY TO ANY OF MY COFFEE DRINKING JW FANS!!
726,3,"ITS A GREAT COFFEE CUP ,BUT I WOULDNT CALL IT A TRAVEL MUG.  THE LID WILL NOT SEAL ON CUP AND YOU BETTER PLAN ON WEARING YOUR COFFEE IF YOU TRY TO SIP WITH LID ON. JW ARTWORK GREAT!"
727,5,Excellent. This product make a good coffee in every cup. I'm use in my office and all are very happy with this product.
728,5,"I attempted to use a paintball tank for my planted aquarium, which was a horrible idea. This tank is well made and I am so happy with it. It only cost about $25 to fill it, but places will swap them out at much cheaper prices. I'm using it with the Aquatek Premium CO2 regulator and it works great!"
729,5,"I like it very much.  I can prepare food faster.  When I bake cakes and muffins they taste delicious.  The inside of the oven keeps clean, because of the material that is built of."
730,5,"This was a gift for my father. I was worry about it being shipped, but it came packed very well, and there were not any problems. The price was fantastic too!"
731,5,We are very fussy about our pepper mills and you get what you pay for. We like the different levels of grind you can set and overall its a great product.
732,5,These clips work great and the magnet on them is also strong. they are also strong enough to connect two bags in one clip.
733,5,"I love this. I've had one before and they're great.<br /><br />Two things I like: First, it has a nifty, detachable handle. Why do some of the other ones have no dang handle? That's just plain silly! Of course you need a way to grab a hold of it so you can take it off the stove when you need to. Sheesh! Other thing I like: It's CHEAP! I'm not a cheap-o, but why not get the inexpensive one with the handle? You can save some bucks plus you've got a way to grab onto it too. The stores all have the fancy, handle-less ones now because they are more expensive so they can make more money on them. But you'll feel pretty silly with the expensive one sitting on your burner and you've got no way to take it off when you need to. Yur friends are gonna laugh at you too. Hahaha. Just sayin.'"
734,4,It is a very good product.Its very easy to operate and it is a very good and easy to handle.I strongly request everyone to try it.Most importantly the whole company stands behind their product.
735,5,"I got it for my wife, something fun. She likes it. Good for a laugh & a better medication than what her doctor prescribed"
736,5,This is by far the absolute best covered fryer that I have ever owned.  The size is perfect for so many things and cleanup is a snap.  I would recommend this to anyone.
737,5,"I had been living in an old converted refrigerator in the woods for many many years . I had turned my back on society and society had turned its back on me.<br /><br />I had been surviving by milking badgers, collecting sparrows eggs and growing fruit and veg out of the salad trays in my refrigerator .<br />But then one bright spring morning, i happened across a rather eccentric looking man,. He was wearing Lederhosen and a bright feathered hat and was hanging upside down from a tree in an animal trap. shouting &#34;Hilfe! Hilfe!&#34;<br /><br />I did what anyone would do, i helped him him down and fed him some badger cheese. He thanked me most sincerely and explained his name was Hutzler and he had invented something which could potentially change the world of banana slicing as we know it.<br /><br />Intrigued, i watched as he took out a banana and peeled it. He then proceeded to pull out his amazing invention. Before my very eyes i saw the most magical thing i had ever seen... with one swift movement the banana fell into 20 perfect slices!<br /><br />The rest is history... I of course left the woods with him with my faith in humanity restored.<br /><br />Today i live in a luxury refrigerator on the roof of his penthouse apartment with all the sliced banana i can eat. In return i make him the finest badger cheese and polish his Lederhosen three times a week.<br /><br />Life is good!"
738,5,After all these years (I am now almost 80) I finally purchased a complete set of Wusthof knives and I cannot tell you how wonderful it is to now prepare meals with these beautiful utensils. My only wish is that I could have gone up a grade or two.
739,5,"I purchased this pan at Costco and then couldn't find it again.  I was thrilled to find it here.  It is GREAT!!!  I have 3 and I purchased 2 for my son.  Just LOVE IT!!!!!  Easy to clean, doesn't warp.  Strong and solid, but light weight.  LOVE IT!!!"
740,4,"It does what you would expect, and works well, especially for the price.<br /><br />That said, it would be nice if it were a little bigger."
741,5,"beautiful dessert stand. Nice and heavy. Instructions would have been helpful, but once I figured it out - it was a really substantial serving piece that I know I will have years of use from."
742,5,First I ordered only one mat to see if it was what I was looking for and I love it. Now I got this second one to cover the whole space of granite counter I have and it worked perfect. I use now both of them and are easy to store to dry. My counters are clean of dishes sooner and my visitors from Mexico were amazed with my product. We could go out of the house without any worries about my kitchen being unorganized. I recommend this product completely.
743,5,"very good it is my new favorite knife and as a chef good knives are important ,it is comfortable and well balanced."
744,5,"exactly what I wanted only BETTER ! I had the kitchen remodeled and we had a<br />single sink put in. well.. now what do we do with dishes ? we got this and glad we did !<br />love it, for those times I do wish to use my single sink for a few dishes this is just great !<br />I don't have to make room for a towel etc. on my new countertops it's wonderful<br />I'd highly recommend. it's large enough to handle a small dinner full of dishes.<br />it also extends to fit all sinks and has rubber on the ends to protect your good granite, etc. countertops at the sink<br />area.<br />buy one. you'll be glad you did"
745,3,Necessary to keep your coffee pot working properly.  Especially if you have hard water.  Or you can use distilled water and forget the filters.
746,2,"Pros:<br />- Cheap<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The lid handle broke in the first three months. It's usable, but needs extra care<br />- And then the filter (the sieve near the nose) broke.<br />- After a while, the kettle started to boil water for a few minutes before stopping. Most of the times I stop it manually."
747,5,Hue fan of SOA and this is a must have for any fan. Nice size also! Highly recommended. Fast shipping as well.
748,1,"This little piece quit exactly in a month. I guess it time bombed itself. I now its cheap, but expected it'll last another month at least.<br />highly disappointed! invest a few more bucks and buy a better quality product!"
749,4,"We were able to make Jello, crayons, and fondant shapes! The most difficult one was the fondant, they didn't shape so well, but well enough for the kids to enjoy. :)"
750,1,"I dont know, I use it for preparing smoothie in the morning of fruit. Broke.<br />debating what should I do.<br />Does it have a warranty or somethimg.<br />Would appreciate a feedback"
751,5,"I have a set of Wusthof kitchen knives, I had been using the Wusthof Hand-Held Santoku Knife Sharpener, which wasn't working. On close inspection the Santoku sharpener, it had actually developed a little flat ledge, and was dulling the knives! I'd been using the honing spike to try and get a bit better edge with a little success, but not much.<br /><br />I decided to try out the wet stone. It took a bit of practice and some boldness to put my hand right on the blade while sharpening it. But holly crap. The results are amazing. The knives actually feel like they're pulling themselves through the target veggie victims. I'm fairly sure that If I got into a fight with a Jedi, that'd my now razor sharp knives would cut right through their light sabers. It's a joy to slice up those peppers now. I look forward to chopping."
752,3,"I bought this because I had 3 cases of pineapples to cut up to can.  I thought it would make my job a little easier but, it didn't.  If I had only been doing one or two I might have liked it better but, my arm got really tired turning this thing.  It gets really slippery and there's nothing to assist in getting the core out once you've cut it.  You have to take the handle off each time to take out the core and like I said with the slippery pineapple I was constantly banging my fingers.  It works, I just wasn't real impressed.  Also, if you intentions are like mine and you want to can pineapple rings this won't work because the pineapple rings are to big for your wide mouth jars."
753,5,i ordered two size's the 6qrt and the 4.5. quart i love them both they are beautiful to look at two tone's of blue and cook like a dream i absolutely love them and i feel safe saying i will have these for many year's to come .. great price's on amazon at over 75% off in saving's
754,5,I love my bowl but when it cracked on me because of hard cheese in the processor  amazon was able to have it available
755,4,"Let it never be said that one can have TOO much strength in a meat grinder, am I right?  This unit rips through just about everything; flesh, bone, grey matter... there is even a customized attachment that will filter out jewelry and pesky prosthetic pins, etc.  And equally important, it cleans up quicker than you can say &#34;quid pro quo.&#34;  Customers at the Baltimore Food Fair have never gorged themselves on my culinary creations with such bloodthirsty zeal.  Nary a crumb of evide... er, leftovers!<br /><br />Only thing that could make this product better is if it came packaged with ear plugs and plastic tarps.  Suggestions?<br /><br />Clarice<br />Starling's Artisinal Sausage Co.<br />Baltimore, MD"
756,5,Arrived in great shape and perfect condition.  They are both in full use.we were very happy with the transaction and merchandise.
757,5,Making storage easy. No more looking for covers all over the cabinet. Great sizes. A must have for an orgainized cabinet!
758,5,The sauce boat met my expectations and is the correct size for making gravy. I love all my Fiesta ware.
759,5,this machine makes an excellent loaf of bread.  this is coming from a guy that has never baked a loaf of bread in his life.
760,4,"These are not the super flimsy type that bend under slight pressure.  I would call them medium weight, but they work as expected of plastic utensils. Descent price and strong enough to clean and re-use. I know, they are supposed to be throw away's, but it is not of my nature to waste."
761,5,Love it! Super excited about having my own... Was introduced to it at a local bar who gave me info on it. Best &#34; muddler&#34; ever. Recommended for the ultimate Mojito drinker.
762,3,I assume I will lose the  cap quickly thus rendering the tool completely useless but it's okay. It's small and I don't even know where it is right now!
763,5,Just the perfect size... i finally can put enough food into it and my empanadas come out delicious.<br />Thanks so much!
764,5,"These replacement blades work great!  My daughter was so disappointed when our Magic Bullet blade was stripped at the rubber socket... she loves her smoothies in the morning!  So, needless to say, she was absolutely thrilled when I was able to find the replacement blades.  I have used the replacement blades three times since purchasing them, and they work great!  I would highly recommend them."
765,4,"I bought this coffee maker on Amazon to replace the previous earlier model Black and Decker Thermal Coffeemaker I used daily for 3 years without a problem(exactly the same model, but without the stainless steel on the basket holder). I love this coffee maker because the thermal carafe really keeps coffee hot without it getting burned.  Even if the coffee gets cold after a couple hours, you can microwave the coffee without fear of a burnt taste because it hasn't been sitting on a hot plate for hours.<br /><br />Soon after I ordered this new coffeemaker, however, I realized that 2 or 3 times a week half the coffee would end up all over the counter after auto-brewing.  I thought that the &#34;pause-and-serve&#34; mechanism wasn't getting pressed in enough, so I removed it (very easily removed, pull the knob and spring out of the bottom of the basket, which is just held in place by a rubber gasket).  However this did not solve the problem.  The problem, it seems, was in the lid of the carafe.  There is a &#34;one-way-valve&#34; type mechanism in the lid that allows coffee to flow into the lid but in *theory* if it were inverted would prevent or limit it from coming out.  This &#34;peg&#34; causes just enough obstruction that it can occasionally create an air-liquid seal that during brewing prevents coffee from flowing into the pot, resulting in coffee all over your counter.  The solution:  Take the lid off of the carafe, invert it, and use a pair of needle nose pliers to grasp the &#34;peg&#34; in the center and pull it out.  Problem solved. I have since replaced the &#34;pause-and-serve&#34; mechanism which is occasionally nice to have.<br /><br />There is a simple way to figure out of the problem you have is with the &#34;pause-and-serve&#34; mechanism or with the lid's one-way-valve:  If the coffee that spills over your counter has grounds mixed with it, it is leaking directly over the basket and it is the &#34;pause-and-serve&#34; mechanism.  If the coffee that spills is free of grounds, then it is the lid mechanism.<br /><br />Without these problems, I would give this product 5 stars.  Even with these problems, I would purchase this coffee maker again, because the fix is easy and doesn't make the coffee maker looked &#34;rigged.&#34;  It brews quickly and the coffee always tastes great."
766,4,"For years I've been buying minced garlic in a jar because I didn't want to be bothered with trying to mince it myself.  I can't really figure out why I didn't try out a garlic press sooner, but now that I have one I'm pretty sure I won't be buying that jarred stuff again. Easy enough to use, just pop in a peeled garlic clove and squeeze over your bowl, pot or pan. Flip the handle over and press to make sure you get it all, then toss it in the dishwasher for easy clean up."
767,5,"Color is a bit paler than image, but even better for me. Love these coasters. What is the point of a coaster if it allows moisture through?"
768,5,"It is great, I use it with my new apple press for making wonderful fresh apple juice.  I love it."
769,5,"A great little machine, seems to work almost as hard as our full size unit, very glad to have purchased."
770,5,"I had been eyeing these for quite a while but just kept putting off purchasing them. My office is far from the kitchen area so I was just bringing cold food from home for lunch to eat at my desk. This was getting old, so I decided to bite the bullet and purchase this. I purchased the 2 pack because I have offices and thought I would leave one at each office, but I am finding it so easy to just bring the whole unit back and forth because it is so light weight. I think I will give the other one away as a gift! I was evening thinking these may be good to use to keep cheese dip warm or caramel warm without burning it, which the regular crockpots can do!<br /><br />I am glad I made this purchase and couldn't be more delighted!"
771,1,"I REALLY loved this item, but I have to leave a bad review due to durability. My first mistake was buying a Keurig Vue brewer. I love Keurig, but I had no idea that there are no pods to buy in a retail store for the Vue brewer. I was happy, however, to discover that all I needed to do was buy a K2V cup and everything would be good - k-cups would work. After receiving the k2v cup, everything was good....for about a week. After about a week of average use (2 cups/day, rinsed between uses), the plasic outer cup broke :(  I would give 5 stars just for having this product available to consumers such as myself, however, I'm going to have to rate 1 star on the durability. Because of the price...I'm not sure if I want to invest in another k2v just to have it break after just a week."
772,4,The instructions and everything else worked fine but the lantern itself had many wholes I had to tape up for it to work.
773,5,Although I only used the Smart  Stick which made a smooth soup I can only imagine using the whip and chopper real soon.
774,5,Loads of laughs and it actually works. Your friends and family will have a good laugh and fun with lettuce
775,5,"Bought these gloves for my daughter who was getting bad rashes using regular gloves.  Bought these latex free gloves and no more rashes.  Nice and heavy, she uses them with hot water.  Will buy more."
776,5,A perfect coffee pot. Looks good & keeps it hot for a while. We love it!! It was a great bargain too⭐️
777,3,"This is a very pretty and very well made cheese slicer.  However, the wire is too thick.  It tends to make a mess of the cheese.  You are better off just using a knife."
778,5,"Very light weight but quite sturdy and a dream to clean.  If you are making bread like Artisan one of these is just what you need to mix, raise and store between bakings.  I love this container.  Would tell anyone to get one."
779,3,"I have the stain-resisting Rubbermaid containers which look exactly like these. The picture provided for this item makes it look like the stain-resisting ones but in fact, the plastic for these are more opaque which means they can be stained more easily. If I didn't need containers badly, I would have returned them. A bit of false advertising."
780,5,The press is fine and it gets plenty of use. The size is about right. Just wish I had chosen a round one.
781,1,I didn't get  the airbake WearEver. I got another brand. I tried it and it wasn't good at all. My cookies sticked on the sheet
782,5,A very well made Percolator and stainless steel too. Percolator are hard to find and one to survive the camping trips are even more rare. We still like to tent camp on occasion when traveling across the country on a Goldwing trike. Not all campgrounds have electric in the tent areas so we carry a one burner stove and this percolator. It does the job very well. I have tried the China version that is sold in the camping equipment section in box stores. The coffee basket holders usually break at the bottom rendering them useless.<br />This Rapid Brew percolator is well made and will still look new after many uses.
783,5,"Was a gift for my popcorn loving girlfriend. Apartment has smelled of popcorn ever since.  Thank you much, she loved it."
784,5,"Pleasantly surprised. They're plastic material, with a faux wood grain finish. This works for me because they will be less easily scratched or damaged by the kids. I loved the greyish brown color that fits with the minimalist zen look I am after."
785,5,"I have a thing for perfectly steamed milk. Great little gadget, no complaints!! Wonderful for hot chocolate or mixing any warm beverage to perfection!"
786,4,"The item fit my stove but it was extremely thin.  Glad it was dark black as it does stain from food dropping on it.  Overall, I have had no problems with this item."
787,5,Got this knife to dress-out meat rabbits.  This thing is SHARP & makes for effortless cutting/slicing.  I also picked up a Ontario Knife Company Old Hickory 76-7 Cleaver to break the rabbits down for food prep.
788,5,"just all too geeked about carry my lunch now!! LOL, I am very pleased with the quality and such a great touch to &#34;brown bagging&#34;. I enjoy my meals just as if I were at home with these ultra cute lunch buddies."
789,1,"This machine was terrible. Using only cheese on the tortilla, the maker wouldn't close. After holding the lid down to cook the quesadilla, the cheese melted and ran under the plates. With no way to clean it, it was disgusting. After one use, it was thrown away. What a waste of money."
790,4,"It's good, but it stains after a while very easily. I cook lots of pasta in this and if you don't clean it immediately the starch easily stains the pot."
791,2,Not really very sharp.<br />Wish they would have come with covers. Would not recommend these knives to chefs. But for not chefs they are ok.
792,1,I too saw a demonstration at the grocery.  Looked amazing.  I kept thinking I should of bought this.  I finally ordered this on amazon.  I opened the shipping box to find this item I paid over 40 dollars for has a 13.99 orange price tag on the box..  Uuuum ok .  I am paying this seller over 40.00 where it was selling for 13.99 somewhere..  Not to mention this is junk.  I find it hard to believe that there are so many good reviews for this garbage.
793,5,Been using these for years. My dunkin donuts coffee couldnt taste any better. I would highly recommend to any serious coffee drinker.
794,2,"The glass was good quality, so I'll give it that, but the lids were terrible. All I had to do was simply hold the bowl upside down (not even shake it) and the lid popped off. There was no way that these storage bowls were going to keep my foods properly. So, I put in my request for return. The return process went off without a hitch, even got my shipping and handling charge refunded. The second star in my rating goes to the customer service."
795,5,for either decorative purposes or serving meals on...i have botanic garden and these trays match perfectly...brings a smile to my mom who is a shut in and brightens her day...she is spoiled
796,5,"While these strainers cost more than $5 each, I'm glad I bought them. They're worth the money. They're well made from quality materials, and look as though they'll stand lots of use."
797,5,"I was amazed by the quality and style of this flask. I was wortied that since I had only two words engraved, there would be too much open space on the panel. Much to my surprise-and delight- the text was spaced and sized perfectly, and an awesome font had been used. Product came EXACTLY as I had envisioned, it came on time, and not to mention the UNBEATABLE PRICE!!! Thank you CKB for a refreshingly genuine product, and experience."
798,5,the price almost scared me away but I got it anyways and have canned everything possible .. little discolored after one use but works great
799,5,I received one 2 years ago for Christmas and now I have about 7 of them and try to only use them and I cook alot.<br />You have to be careful they are fragile<br />My daughter broke the blade on an avacado pit. She didn't realize they were fragile.
800,1,"I bought this pan at HEB and seasoned it like the directions said, in the oven.  It worked great the first few times but then started to stick.  I thought &#34; no pan is non-stick&#34; so I started adding oil while cooking.  Now there are sticky spots that do not come off unless I us baking soda and an SOS pad!! I can't believe I bought into this and didn't keep my receipt.  Very unhappy with my purchase at this point."
801,5,Zojirushi makes quality product.  5 hours into my work shift and the food is still hot.  I have 2 other Zojirushi mug which keeps my tea and coffee hot all day long.
802,1,I ordered a white rectangular platter and instead I got a stainless steel FORK! How ridiculous!! And then here I am on the phone and now I have to go and return it! Ridiculous!!
803,3,"First the seller send me a 12 rack Idli stand, in the box of 16, but then after asking for an exchange..I got the correct one. Amazon was generous enough, to not bother me with the return of the previous one..which I anyway gave away.<br /><br />About the quality of the stand - It's not the best quality steel stand you would wish for. But I guess it's sort of okay for the price. Would have been happier though, if I had to pay less for it, given the quality!"
804,5,"It's a good funnel. The strainer is good too. You just have to make sure you put the strainer in the right position though, or the fluid won't go through the funnel. I recommend this funnel."
805,5,"Bought this for my wife to cook &#34;Pho&#34;, a Vietnamese noodle soup that requires 24 hrs to cook. She loves the pot because it heats quickly and evenly.  Using this to slow cook the bones was perfect.  Most other pot I found or seen does not come with lifetime warranty. With the large size it still fits our gas cooktop and sink cleaning. It is a very high quality pot by the look and feel of it.  We live by a restaurant supply store and I went there to check out other stainless steel pot. They cost 1/2 the price but not the same quality at all, you can feel and see the differences. The handle on this is riveted in and will not fall off and the bottom is as thick as it claims which help makes heating very evenly.  This pot will definitely last a lifetime."
806,5,Bought these for a friend and a pair for myself.  We both love these scissors!  Chopping herbs is so quick and easy now.  Just rinse when done.  Very sharp so be extra careful.
807,5,"i'm in my forties and this is my 3rd opener.  this is the only one i will buy and use.  i have tried other types of openers in the past and they usually disappoint.  EZ=DUZ is a strong opener and always works on whatever i am opening.  i've owned 3 cuz i've moved or didn't keep it clean enough and it just started gettn yucky but other than that i will always use this opener.  oh and my ma and sisters use it to, that's where i learned it."
808,5,I plan to buy more of these.  They are great for my lunch bag and storing stuff in the fridge.  So nice that the food only touches glass... so much better than storing in plastic!
809,5,I bought this for valentines day and it made a very lovely cookie.  My cookie batch typically yields 30 medium cookies and I used 2/3rds of that dough in this pan.  I would recommend using a baking spray before putting in your cookie dough though - makes it much easier to get out and clean later on.
810,5,"Simply put, this coffee maker makes great coffee.  It is simple to use.  Despite what I'd read in other reviews, it heats up and is ready to use relatively quickly.<br /><br />There are a couple of minor issues with design features that we have been able to work around.  The foaming wand is quite low so that it is difficult to get even a small foaming pitcher back out from underneath without spilling milk.  Our workaround was to make a 1 1/2&#34; wood base to put under the machine.  Another issue is that the small plastic insert into the basket that enhances milk foaming is easy to lose during cleaning.  It would be nice if a replacement or two were included with the machine.  We keep a shot glass on top of the maching to store this little piece in."
811,3,"Everything else I ordered from Amazon (on Feb. 23) for our Oscar Party arrived before our celebration. These napkins did not. I finally went over to Party City and found the same napkins (a little cheaper!) for our Family Night at the Oscars. I will save these napkins for next year's party, but I probably won't buy items from this vendor again... too slow on delivering."
812,4,"Nicely finished product, excellent standard and fits my Nespresso Citiz perfectly.  One unneccessary feature - there's a catch at the bottom of the drawer that prevents the drawer from fully opening.  Presumably this was to prevent the drawer from coming off its runner.  Needless to say that this is a needless addition - it prevents access to the last row."
813,5,"George Tarleton is a technician for the organization Advanced Idea Mechanics (AIM). He was born in Bangor, Maine. Having recently created the artifact the Cosmic Cube, the AIM scientists use advanced mutagenics to alter Tarleton and create the super intelligent MODOC (acronym for Mental Organism Designed Only for Computing) to study and improve the object. MODOC, however, becomes ambitious and kills its former masters and takes control of AIM. Calling itself MODOK (Mental Organism Designed Only for Killing), it comes into conflict with the heroes of the Marvel universe! Now immortalized (unless you machine wash!) as the Mobile Organism Designed Only for Koffee! Yes, that is how you spell koffee in A.I.M.!"
814,5,"My husband loves French press coffee, but ours have a habit of giving out. This one has lasted us quite a while and can make a good portion of coffee...enough to fill his thermos before he goes to work."
815,5,We bought this coffeemaker based on ratings in Consumer Reports. It's working great and looks nice on the kitchen counter.
816,5,"it is a bigger bowl than the one in my set, and footed, I actually like drinking my coffee in one of these :-)"
817,5,"there is no problem to buy in this site. On time, tha's what I expected. Recomended site.  Satsfied!  You can buy."
818,5,"I just received this tofu press and it's the best thing since slice bread!! I've been using tofu for many years, but I've had enough with putting heavy objects on top of a plate just so the tofu would flatten, but it took so long. I didn't even know about this product until I searched 'how to press tofu' and this came up. I HAD TO HAVE IT!! It arrived lightning fast and I used it right away. In fact, I just made my first meal as soon as I received it. It didn't take that long to get the fluid out of the tofu I used at all. I can already tell this product will last me years and years. I HIGHLY recommend this product!! Absolutely amazing product! :)"
819,5,"This is one great little juicer! Just used it for the first time and so far I can say it works great! Just did carrots, Apple's and oranges. Made a wonderful and HEALTHY drink! There really wasn't that much pulp and what was there was relatively dry. One thing you must remember, it's only 400 watts. Not the most powerful juicer out there. But it sure does the job. The loading chute is pretty small, so it does take a bit of preparation before you can start juicing. But who cares?! You're making homemade, healthy juice with zero. chemicals and preservatives"
820,5,Beautifully made and presented and does its job very well. great for browning slow-roasted meats on the stove top...lid prevents splashes so no clean up needed.
821,5,"It's an adult sippy cup.  I have never had a cup that was labeled leak proof that actually was....till now.  They are such nice cups, they wash great and really keep things as hot and cold as they say they do."
822,1,"These bowls look pretty and nice, but when I made soup it left a funny taste in my mouth.  Tasted like....racism. Blech!"
823,5,"These wonderful espresso makers need replacement gaskets from time to time - for me, about 6 months.  This product is the perfect replacement and lasts as long or longer than the originals.  I always have one replacement gasket in stock, as I use by espresso maker each and every day."
824,5,the metal parts keep the threads from wearing out.  way better than the last one I had!! would recommend to anyone who has had trouble with threads stripping out
825,5,"We buy bulk lettuce from Costco at a pound at a time. We try to eat salad often, but after all we are American so sometimes it takes us awhile to go through it. Generally this thing keeps it fresh long enough for us to eat it before it turns into some kinda weird gunk. I would say that its doing its job well enough for me."
826,4,I bought this to keep my cereal fresh and keep the bugs out. It does both jobs to my satisfaction.
827,5,"I live alone but every so often I want to make a beloved dish that serves a lot .. I'm not good at halving recipes and getting the same really good results (Chili, US Senate Navy Bean Soup, Chicken Noodle Soup, etc).. This are 1 qt containers and handle the freezer sub-zero temp just fine.. I hated the square snap-on top storage cases.. they stain and really are not that air-tight.. the screw-on tops these guys have really do seal well and the product they contain tastes just like the fresh original dish when you open and heat the contents 4 months later.. I can't say enough about them.. go in the dishwasher and come out looking brand new.  Zip-Lock makes the same container, and they compare favorably in terms of quality.  They stack one in the other (lids separate of course) and I wouldn't be without them anymore.  They're a little pricy for what you expect in a plastic item, but well made and durable."
828,5,I've had so many of those cheap squeeze to open mesh tea strainers but they always start to open up and the tea leaves get into the tea. Not so with this strainer. I love it! Will probably buy a few more - we are big tea drinkers!
829,5,perfect
830,1,"Last night (2/13/14)  I placed one baking size potato in the microwave potato bag to cook and after about 7 minutes<br />it caught on fire and I had to rush it to the kitchen sink to extinguish it's fire.<br />Luckily,other than the bag being badly damaged and the heavy smoke smell, no other damage occurred.<br />I now regret having purchased the potato bag and would not do so again, and, needless to say, I wouldn't<br />recommend it to anyone.<br />What a waste of money and a scary experience."
831,5,"I would highly recommend this product to anyone, especially my friends and family that take a longer period of time to drink a full pot of coffee.  The coffee stays hot in the thermal pot and doesn't get that bitter-burnt taste that usually comes after a couple of hours of sitting on the warmer.  I am very impressed with my new coffee pot. So much so I am considering ordering one just like it for my summer place at the lake."
832,5,"Tupperware products are always exactly as advertised.  In the past, I have occasionally had to return them after multiple uses and / or multiple years and have always been given a brand new prodcut to replace my damaged one.  I love the quality of Tupperware."
833,4,"This egg poacher is great. We now have poached eggs more often. It is best to grease the poacher first. I use butter, but any oil will be ok. Just put 1/2 cup of water in a 10 inch frying pan, bring to a boil, and place the poacher in the pan.<br /><br /> I add the eggs now, and cover the pan. In 3 min. they are done. I would suggest that when you remove the cover pick it up level or the steam/water on the inside of the cover will drip on the eggs."
834,2,Not what I expected. This did not fit my stove top surface well which made it awkward to cook with.
835,5,"i really love juice, but i use to always buys stuff like Naked, or Odwalla... this makes all of that much cheaper, and i can tweak the recipes to my desire."
836,5,"A gift, but I have an old one like it.  Does a wonderful, fast job at removing corn from the cob for freezing."
837,5,It makes popping pop corn a breeze.  Almost every kernel pops no matter which brand I use.  I love it!
838,5,My wife was very happy with the mugs. High quality and they feel great in your hand.<br /><br />Each mug has both characters. They are not &#34;his and hers&#34; mugs.
839,1,They described a bag that was 8.7&#34; x 9.0&#34; x 5.9&#34;.  I was shocked when I received this bag that was 8.0&#34; x 7.5&#34; x 5.0&#34; -- now I have to figure out if I can even return it for a refund -- and right now it's not looking promising.  Guess I will be out some money.  REALLY not happy.
840,4,I think these are great vacuum bottles. They are perfect size and fit in the cup holders well. My coffee stays very hot until it is finished. The only down side is I have not figured how to dis assemble  the top for cleaning. Hence the 4 star rating.
841,5,when you don't want to brew a full pot of coffee. The directions say this is a 5 cup coffee maker but I don't know anyone who uses such small cups! It actually makes two full mugs of coffee when filled to the 4 cup level on the pot. My husband uses this every morning and his old one finally wore out after several years. The heating element failed to keep the coffee hot. It is the perfect size for 2 mugs of coffee and we liked the old coffeemaker so much we bought another one when that one failed to keep the coffee hot.
842,5,Bought this as a Christmas present for my significant other and so far she has made some excellent mac and cheese and minestrone soup. Can't wait to try out more recipes. Being able to pop out the bowl inside makes cleaning and storing food in the fridge much easier.
843,5,"It far exceeded my expectations. It keeps every coffee, cocoa and tea flavor right at my fingertips. It also rotates so you can find what you are looking for."
844,5,"This juicer works great. I got this one after seeing Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead. I use it everyday and it is easy to use, clean, and assemble. The product arrived in excellent packaging and looked brand new. I would recommend this juice to anyone who is looking to get into juicing."
845,5,"I love this mug! The design is simple and elegant inside and outside of the mug! My only complaint is I wish it came with a gift box or a more suitable wrapping for a bridal shower gift!  Nevertheless I have the set and both are lovely, very happy!!"
846,4,I like the size and the fact the cutting board is bamboo. Very durable like all Corningware.  The only thing I would change is I wish it was a bit deeper to catch juices from meats.  I would recommend it and would buy it again.  I'm careful not to use with juicy meats.
847,4,"Good coffee maker, we really like using our own coffee not the k cups. So far so good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I thought it would be a bit quieter?"
848,5,I love that they are a dark brown with a natural color off white...much richer looking than stark white.<br />I am trying to decide if I should order another set I like them so much.
849,5,Found that this will work great at the bar..  to keep the salt and sugar or whatever else we use clean from anything getting into it.  Love the fact that it closes up and takes little room
850,5,"I highly recommend this rotisserie! Excellent value for the money. Easy to use, and easy to clean (I cover the inside of drip pan with aluminum foil, which makes cleanup even easier).<br />So far I have made prime rib, whole chicken, and beef kabobs. All turned out incredibly well! Great purchase :)"
851,5,"I have used this machine every day since I got it. Its easy to use, easy to clean, and it works perfectly. I love this maker. I've done pizza dough, hot dog rolls, cinnamon buns, and a dozen loaves of bread. It's pricey but excellent quality."
852,4,I threw away my old steamer last year. I had it 40 years. This new old is very well made and I hope it lasts 40 years.
853,5,"I really like the fact that it doesn't have a &#34;minimum&#34; level marker like almost every other brand and model does.  it's a pleasure to work with this thing, and it's adjustable temperature setting is an extra bonus for such a small appliance.  The bottom heating surface is an elegant stainless steel, so this thing is great to look at tool.  I have noticed no issues with plastic or chemical odors that others have mentioned.  Highly recommended."
854,5,I gave this knife to my husband as an Xmas gift.  He loved it!<br />It is a great knife and surpasses all others we have..  We will purchase more of this brand!  5stars!!!
855,1,"When I bought this microwave the reviews showed good.  I see now they are at the other end of the chart (BAD).  A couple of weeks into using it I started flipping my circuit breakers. Thinking we were overloaded we added a new electrical line and circuit breaker, only to find out it was the microwave's fault. Maybe we aught to start manufacturing our own appliance here in the U.S. once again, with an emphasis on making things last."
856,5,"I love my KitchenAid. This is my first one and I don't know how I was able to live without it all this time.  It is easy to use.  The mechanics works smoothly.  It is heavy to move, but it is sturdy and that is a plus.  I use it weekly, and when I don't I feel like I need to.  It makes mixing, baking, and mashed potatoes so easy!  Five stars.  Couldn't be happier."
857,2,"the  body of the filter cracked 2 times on me, maybe due to screwing on tightly?!<br /><br />very poor quality construction, only last me 2 months"
858,1,"I thought this soft silicone but red part on the top is like hard plastic like thing.  I put it in the dishwasher to wash it but every time it comes out of the dishwasher, it seems to get more warped.  Maybe it I'm not supposed to use dishwasher for this,...For me, things that I cannot stick in the dishwasher to clean is not a good kitchen item.  Not recommended.  I'm going to find the one that's made of Silicone next time...."
859,5,This was given as a gift but I saw the recipent open it and they were completely happy.  All flatware was well packed and arrived as promised.
860,1,This is not what I ordered. I ordered a product that was advertised as 18/10 stainless steel.  The screen that came is a cheaper 18/8 quality.
861,5,"This product is an amazing piece to own in your kitchen.  It is compact, yet sturdy, to fit in any kitchen drawer.  The digital thermometer gave an accurate reading of the different types of meat I cooked.  I tried it on pork loin in the oven, chicken on the grill, and steak on the skillet.  The readings were where I precisely wanted them to be for doneness.  It is fool-proof – no guessing of temperature being somewhere 120-130 degrees – with its easy-to-read and clear digital display.  This is a simple yet powerful kitchen tool.  Clean-up is effortless.  This digital meat thermometer is a definite must-have in every cook’s kitchen."
862,1,"Thought we were getting a deal, hah! Had to cut 2 of these jump ropes in half and tie them together to get one usable one. Then the elastic wore out almost immediately. Save yourself the frustration by driving to your nearest craft store, buying some elastic, and tying a knot in one end. Ta-Da, a Chinese Jump Rope that will last!"
863,5,"Very sturdy. I bought two so I could make an entire row of cookies at once - making any entire package in just three sessions. The wells are very deep - you could use double stuffed cookies if you wanted too. I'm going to try that next. Be waste that if you use regular cookies, you will use an entire bag of candy melts for every dozen cookies you make (so three bags of chocolate for one package of regular cookies).<br /><br />Overall - awesome. I may buy more so I can make entire packages and move through the production line a little faster."
864,2,"I returned the flatware because it was super flimsy and very poorly made, the pieces were very small and hard to hold, the strawberries on the handles were not bright red and were only on one side of the flatware.  Super disappointed in this product."
865,5,"this is the best onion chopper, I bought it for this purpose, it may be useful for other vegetables chopping, I did not try to chop other vegetables, I like its chopping for the onion, small pieces , without mesh,"
866,5,I purchased the 12 inch Olive Wood Spoon.  The grain and color is amazing and truly beautiful. I only hand wash it and oil it with Berio Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  My daughter washed it in the dishwasher while I was in the hospital.  I have oiled it several times since then and it is back to all of it's previous splendor.  Have I ever enthused over a kitchen utensil like this before?  Never.  But these spoons are not an ordinary kitchen utensil.  I will be purchasing the Harold Imports spatula and different length spoons.  I think that they are well worth the money and will be in my kitchen for many years to come.  Would I recommend anybody else to buy these olive wood utensils?  Heck yeah!
867,5,"High quality pot and makes a great cup of coffee. Using Jamaican blue mountain coffee with freshly ground beans,,,is the best!"
868,2,"I thought they looked finished in the pic..I purchased mine in the Brookstone store, these appeared to be similar to mine. When they arrived I found they were just a bad copy.  The handles were not smooth, sanded or stained, they were so lightweight, only the blade had any weight at all. I ordered them for my son, he'll sand, and stain them, but they will never have the nice weight of the ones I have...these were a cheap copy!"
869,4,"I like the Farberware stainless steel cookware for my day to day cooking, it's easy to clean, heats the food evenly, and doesn't leach into the food like aluminum cookware does."
870,4,Easier on the wrist when scrubbing those vegs.  Works great and handily fits in my palm.  I keep it in the drawer next to the veg sink.
871,5,"This was a gift for my husband and he LOVES it! It is easy to operate, makes several cup sizes, and coffee is ready in seconds. I love it, too!"
872,5,"Great item! Great service!  Last minute Christmas gift.  Arrived on time and my mom just loved it, especially for holiday visitors."
873,3,"I bought this strictly for making my daily smoothie, but now know I wasted my money. It does not chop finely enough and I have to revert to using my Magic Bullet again. If you like chunky smoothies, like frozen banana chunks, then go for it."
874,5,"Screws right into the bottom of my existing can.  Nice over-molded wheels, good sturdy construction.  This seems to be better and less expensive than other dollies out there."
875,2,"My kids and I bought this as a Christmas present for my husband. The unit never heated up after &#34;pre-heating&#34; for like 15 minutes. We finally decided that the heating element was no good and that we should send it back. I ended up exchanging the machine for a new one -- which also has proved to be VERY disappointing. This one works, or, kind of works... But not really good. Things that suck about this product:<br /><br />1. Popcorn will pop, but not fall out of the popper basket. It then burns, you will have to scrape it out and it's a mess.<br /><br />2. Using less popcorn in the popper to try to avoid burning and a packed basket only makes the popcorn making process with this machine take about 20 minutes to have enough popcorn to enjoy with others... Too long to wait for one full batch (or large bowl) of popcorn.<br /><br />3. The door at the bottom that folds down traps all the unpopped kernels and popcorn debris in the hinge making it very hard to clean and close.<br /><br />4. Hard to clean<br /><br />On the flipside, it's super cute and looks fun. I think our old $10 air popper will be back in business after all. Sorry Bella, maybe next time..."
876,3,These are really cute and will be fun for a birthday party. Watch the pricing. You may be able to find this cheaper at a local party store
877,4,I initially bought this spatula as an add-on to an existing order to qualify for free shipping.  It has become the only spatula we use and we love it.<br />My only quibble is that the plastic handle has started to crack.  It is still usable but I'm always leery of the health issues of bacteria collecting in the cracks of utensils.  I hope the company fixes this flaw.
878,5,"First and foremost, this water kettle is brilliant and beautiful.  It feels unnecessarily techie and awesome.  So awesome, I just like watching it boil water, which DOESN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE!  Digital temperature readouts?  Color-changing, water-indicating readout thing?  Temp hold?! THIS IS AMAZING!  It even has a place for a water filter because why wouldn't it!  Stop the madness!<br /><br />This thing, I am convinced, has a direct line to the power of Hades.  It heats up water its full tank from 85 to 195 in 4.5 minutes.  Put less water in (enough for just your french press) and it flies through the numbers.<br /><br />In all, I love this kettle, and I've never been one for tea kettles.  It's so much simpler (and faster) than its competitors and looks good doing it.  I can't recommend it enough!<br /><br />I received this from the manufacturer for testing and review and have shared my honest experience in this review."
879,5,Wow.  Who knew that we could be just like chefs at home.  I saw Bobby Flay  talk about this steamer / cheese melter for burgers and he said we all should have one in our kitchen.  Amazon had the product and now I can make diner style burgers at home.  Note that you do need to use a mitten with this top as it does get hot. This dome is big enough to cover several burgers at a time.
880,5,These are the best knives and blades that I ever had.  I'm a deer hunter in Georgia and they are always in use skinning deer and hogs.
881,5,I love that it fits through my finger and is so much easier to use when cleaning.  Would recommend to a friend
882,5,"Bought for me and friends and family who are notorious for spilling/breaking wine glasses. These do not disappoint! They have been dropped a few times already and have no scratches or cracks. They aren't completely spill proof; a few drops still slips out from under the latch. But hey, that's way better than the alternative!<br />Very pleased!"
883,5,"Fits securely into mugs and is solidly constructed. Pretty well-priced for a ceramic dripper. I expect it will last forever, or until it gets dropped one day. Bear in mind that it's only really suited for brewing up to ~16 oz at a time (though with patience you can get an entire Stanley Thermos to brew through it in a pinch). Great for an office environment with access to hot water! And the included filters are a nice plus."
884,5,"Bought this as a gift for a co-worker whos stove was out, It is doing the job and letting them cook till they can replace the stove.Worth the money and saved the day."
885,5,Love having these spoons on my fridge and always handy.  I have been handwashing them and the magnets are still snug.
886,5,"This has been a fun tradition to make a gingerbread house every Christmas.  The hardest part is getting the sides to stay together, but if you do this the day before and have soup cans to hold it in place, it is ready to decorate the next day.  I have also purchased this as a gift and they were very excited to have their own kit."
887,5,Awesome to use and make julienne carrots.  so much easier than trying to cut the carrot with your knife. GREAT
888,4,"Very good toaster, can't give it 5 stars, don't know how long it will last.  If it is still working next year, it will be a 5 star"
889,5,The recipient of this gift was thrilled with the wheel and the information presented on both sides.  He plans to use it a lot.
890,2,"Have to admit, it does make good popcorn, but for how long.  Have used it a couple of times, and directions say to clean it with a paper towel!  Well, I want to wash it, but the top is such thin flimsy metal, I'm afraid something will bend.  There is a thin wire type thing that moves the popcorn around while popping.  I don't expect that thing to stay on for long.  The Amish white popcorn I bought extra (expensive), was excellent taste, and hardly any hulls!"
891,1,"I purchased this exact same model about 10 years ago.  After taking items to work and the occasional garbage disposal accident I decided to order another set because I got sick of running out.  The quality is way down.  The pieces are at least 50 percent lighter.  The size proportions are all different.  For instance the salad fork is 3 or 4 cm shorter.<br /><br />I matched the set in design and what is stamped on the old set.  Overall, it's much crappier.  Although the design is pretty and simple."
892,2,"I really liked the mug a lot at first ,since it has a very cool idea,but it gets bad very soon ."
893,5,Easy to use and even easier to clean. I would definitely buy this as a gift for someone else to have
894,1,My Daughter bought us this processor last year. I had it for two weeks and it broke. The Disc Stem broke while shredding a semi soft cheese. Cheese continually got stuck between the blade and the chute.<br /><br />Very disappointing. When I went to the suggested website [...] for replacement I was disappointed even further as it is not user friendly. The whole piece of junk goes into the trash!
895,5,"Great gift for it's storied history and uniqueness, each being hand made.  My great nephews are going to love it."
896,1,"I figured for $10 should be worth it. Not at all, I am sending them back. They bend very easily. I wanted something more durable. If U don't care that they are flimsy, they are good for the price. I wanted better quality."
897,5,"Very funny! Good quality too. I will definitely be buying these again. And, there is a set of glasses you can buy."
898,5,"I had just bought the Nesco Snackmaster Pro Food Dehydrator FD-75A (which I also recommend if you are in the market for a dehydrator) and bought this to easily be able to make apple chips in the dehydrator.  You can peel, core and slice and apple in 10 seconds.  I end up peeling/slicing more than we need every time because it is fun to use.<br /><br />The owner's manual that comes with it was confusing for me.  If you have never owned one similar to this, I would recommend going to youtube and watching the 5 minute instruction video that Victorio uploaded about this product .  You learn how to set it up in all of the different configurations that you can use it.  [...]"
899,5,We have been using it for a couple of years and my whole family always love the result: crusty bread.
900,4,"We bought this toaster to match our new darker kitchen decor.  It works well, but is shinier than I would like.  Maybe that will change with time."
901,5,"Great product to use for my daughters beach wedding. But photo is deceptive as they do not come with little bows. It does say that in the description, but then why show photo with the bows? Prime shipping is awesome they came really fast!"
902,5,"Great set, good quality, we made these for my son's class birthday treats. He wanted a knight theme for his birthday this year."
903,5,This knife is great for any kitchen.  The purple color is fun and the knife is easy to use and clean.
904,5,"Great and durable, also had trouble finding a bucket. But,  it was my decision to go with Small bags. For the price especially, this is a great buy. If you plan to be doing a lot of extracting, I would definitely go for bigger bags. Shipped fast too."
905,5,Great item I have really enjoyed having it under my Tassimo coffee brewer and having the coffee and hot chocolate disc readily available.
906,5,I used these to make soap and they came out great. Cool shape too. They are flexible and it was easy to remove the soap.
907,5,"I love good bread. I decided to try no-knead baking due to my arthritis. To get the best crust you have to have the baking stone. I have gone through several, breaking, gummed up or just plain not working as wished. I read the reviews and decided to go with this model. Wow works perfectly cleans well and makes the best bread."
908,5,"This bread box is not only beautiful, it does extend the life of bread.<br /><br />I am very happy with this purchase."
909,5,I waited awhile before writing this evaluation. My first cup of tea made with this just tasted &#34;clean and crisp&#34;. Hard to describe - but very positive. It  has taken some experimenting to decide just how many scoops of tea to add to each different type of tea. But even when I didn't get it quite right the tea was still quite drinkable. So far no problems of any sort. I have found the other reviews to be helpful - for example take care of the glass pitcher because if it breaks you have to buy an entire new unit!  So I take care.
910,5,"I did significant research on blenders before buying.  I am pleased to say that I do not regret my decision to go with Blendtec.<br /><br />We have had our blender for about five years now.  The idea was to improve our health by making green smoothies and other healthy items on a regular basis.  Our current blend counter now stands at 2653 blends.  That is a lot of use!  It pulverizes kale, carrots, celery, etc. on a daily basis.  We have had absolutely zero trouble with our Blendtec.  As a result, I have bought blenders for my two daughters and for my son, all of whom are now on their own.  They all rave about their blenders and use them on a daily basis to make green smoothies.<br /><br />If you have the money, I suggest Blendtec or Vitamix.  You can't go wrong either way.  That being said, I prefer Blendtec.  Here are a few reasons why:<br /><br />1.  The Blendtec fits on the countertop under the cabinets.  The Vitamix cannot.  Since we use our unit every day, it didn't seem practical to have to dig out the unit from a pantry or from a cabinet in order to use it.  You don't do that with with a toaster, and you shouldn't have to do that with a blender, either.<br /><br />2. The Blendtec is reasonably attractive whereas the Vitamix is so butt-ugly.  That was important to us because we wanted to leave the unit plugged in on the counter.<br /><br />3.  The Blendtec has recessed buttons that can be wiped off.  With the Vitamix, you have dials and cracks and crevices where spilled food and liquid gets trapped.  As a result, you cannot really clean the exterior of the Vitamix without using a toothpick to dig and scrape around buttons and dials.  This was a big selling point to my wife.<br /><br />4.  My wife saw no need for a tamper that Vitamix has.  She says it is just \\""one more thing to clean.\\""  If you totally overload the jar with too much solid and not enough liquid, a tamper might come in handy.  However, who wants to to have one hand on the tamper while the otherhand is operating a dial?  With Blendtec, all I do is push a button and walk away until the machine automatically completes its blending in a minute or two.<br /><br />4.  My Blendtec jar did get a little cloudy due to grinding nuts and seeds in it.  I have since learned to have a separate jar for making flour and nut butters.  At any rate, I mentioned this to Blendtec and they gave me a new jar -- no questions asked.<br /><br />5.  I love Starbucks drinks and they use Blendtec.  Also, the smoothie shop in my town, Roxberry, also uses Blendtec and they make great smoothies.<br /><br />6.  If you buy your unit at Costco, you get a free 7-year warranty.  I believe that Vitamix offers the same.<br /><br />Blendtec is an awesome product, as is Vitamix.  I recommend that you buy one of these two blenders, as any other blender is simply \\""penny wise and pound foolish.\\"""
911,1,"great until it quit working in less than a year.  The scale in it from water sitting is kinda gross also, but we used it all day off and on.  Better is to get a 200f heater installed under a sink for a hot water tap."
912,5,Just like being in at a soda fountain.  Very heavy glass.  Really love them.  Milk shakes at home a easier with the nice tall size.
913,4,"I have not used it yet, but it looks like something I will like when I get around to it.  I am a caregiver for my wife and am not a cook so I am always looking for something that will make my life easier.  I hope the item does help."
914,5,"It works great. I can fit an entire gallon of yogurt, and in about 12 hours the consistency is amazing. The instructions say to leave it hanging about 6 hours, but 12 hours was right for me."
915,4,"It didn't blow my hair back, but a good little saver that I find superior to my vacuum-pump, for champagne at least - won't build upper arm strength though. Really good for saving champagne if only drinking a partial bottle - keeps mine fizzy for about a week."
916,1,"does not conform to finger even after adjusting finger ring. Also, too tall. does not hold item being sliced, chopped etc.<br />metal very uncomfortable. I kept it but wished I had sent it back. would not recommend it."
917,5,"There are individual lemons with every product, I suppose, but I have not gotten anything but near perfection from either the ISX model or LMX models of coffee maker. Very reliable, lasting for years. The reason I got an LMX was that the coating (teflon?) on the ISX hot plate started to bubble off and look ratty after three years. (It still works, so it is the basement coffee maker for big family get togethers.) The LMX has been perfect for almost four years.<br /><br />Also, these two models share features that have become important to me. First, re &#34;pause 'n serve&#34;: all of the much more expensive and high profile brands (as well as other models of Mr. Coffee) I have ever owned never fail to drip four or five drops onto the hot plate when the pot is pulled out. This Mr. Coffee model's filter holder has a valve incorporating a rocker/cup mechanism on the bottom that has never failed to prevent any drips from getting out. No sizzling drips of coffee on the hot plate that smell when burned off or have to be cleaned off. Ever. Second, re the spout design on the decanter: All decanters that I have ever owned with a glass spout hold onto one or two drops, at least half the time, after pouring. Those drops either drip onto the table when you move the pot, or run down the outside of the pot and end up wherever you set it down. A little coffee-stainy mess more that half the time. This model's plastic edge allows for a precise shape that is a thinner profile than is practical with glass, and it does not hold any drips. Ever. Never a mess."
918,5,"Works well, like the bagle setting which we also use to toast buns. Easy to clean, no complaints. The tongs are a nice addition."
919,3,"I've purchased this product a second time and in both plastic breaks easily after a short time.  However, this is the second one I bought because it's not a big deal.  Everything else about it works great.  Very thin and functional."
920,5,"If we were talking cars instead of personal brewers, this would be a Mercedes Benz and my original one cup at a time Keurig would be a VW Beetle. While I had no desire to buy this brewer and was happy with my minimalist Keurig, my husband was dying to get this new and improved machine. Since he had all sorts of discounts that drove down the price of this brewer it was an affordable temptation.  He is absolutely crazy about the pod system of brewing down to the funky carousel which neatly displays all his favorite blends of joe and this was his idea of heaven because it had a big water reservoir, came with two filters, and even a brew basket for using with bulk coffee.<br />Because it can accommodate five different cup sizes, it makes it all the better. For the most part, this offers some nice versatility except Keurig's idea of a big travel mug and reality is definitely at odds. Nothing serious, but to get this to work with our travel mugs we have to remove the drip tray to get the mug to fit. Otherwise, it does a nice job adjusting to different size cups.<br />Set-up is easy as is the installation of the filter. I have small hands so I had no problem installing the filter.  The rest of the set-up is fast. All you need to do is follow the manufacturer's instructions. Filters need to be replaced about every two months.<br />Aside from the obvious which I have touched on, the cool thing about this is that there is no need to constantly transport water from the sink or water bottle to the Keurig. Needless to say, my husband gets his coffee and lots of it with little effort. Ditto for house guests and family, who just love those pods. At times, I am convinced the pods are the big draw. Everybody here is now happy. There is a shorter, less messy wait time and everyone's coffee is fresh, fresh, fresh. No acrid smell of burned or stale coffee and no dirty pots.<br />The negatives are that this is a larger coffee maker and doesn't fit neatly on the counter under the cabinets in my house as well as the already noted size issue.<br />While tis may not be meant for everyone and it wasn't high on my list of new kitchen appliances, it is attractive and very practical especially when people drop by.s in my house as well as the already noted size issue.<br />While tis may not be meant for everyone and it wasn't high on my list of new kitchen appliances, it is attractive and very practical especially when people drop by."
921,5,"The rubber gasket doesn't have any smell, the stainless steel seems to be good quality, didn't have any discoloration after using it for a few times. Easy to use, just have to follow direction, turning the heat low when the red seal pops up. It is totally sealed that you won't smell the food you are cooking. It's very quiet compared to the old style that releases pressure once in a while, so better not leave it without a timer alarm to remind you the cooking time.<br />Good quality and good price!!! (bought it when it was $49 dollars)"
922,5,Awesome muddler crushes all mint awesome crushes all mint I like pigs and goats and cows muddler is great I like pigs yes u do
923,5,"Great! I'm glad i got this one refurbished. I use it a couple times a week and it works just like new. Easy to clean. It takes up a lot of counter space, though, so I store it under the sink."
924,5,Distills my water in no time flat.  Easy to use and clean up.  Good product at a good price.  Very pleased
925,5,I love these so much! When I opened them they were even cuter than the image online! The colors are vibrant but no over-powering and they go with a lot of different decor styles!!!!
926,5,We love this juicer. We use it to squeeze grapefruit and it works great. The reviews that talk about having to hold it down in the back are correct but we still love it. This one is far superior. compared to several others we have used.
927,5,Love the pan.  Made my  first Quiche and it came out so easy.  Nothing to it.  What was I afraid of?<br /><br />Thank you
928,4,Haave not tried but it is cute and sure to work for what I want it to do.  Again why send out these questions and require certain amount of wording when season is over??
929,5,i rate this a 5 because it was beautiful and great for the price and i don't have any dislike about it and i have recommend it to my friends.
930,5,"I LOVE my water bottle!  It has a wide opening, so it is easy to drink from, and THE WATER tastes SOOOOO good and fresh! I bought one for my 75 yr old Mom, and she said that it makes water taste like how it did when she was a child.  I  don't know how i made it for so long without this bottle! ( like texting!):-)"
931,5,"This product is exactly what I was looking for. I love how easy it is to take apart and clean. It wasn't too expensive, which is another reason I choose it."
932,5,Looks great! And came promptly.<br />Good value for a product that is not easy to find. Twenty  plates forthe price of 8 everywhere else
933,5,A very heavy duty peeler and comfortable in the hand.  Meets expectations for the cost.  I would recommend this peeler to a serious cook.
934,5,"This protective keychain looks fierce! It's scary look makes me feel safer somehow. It is probably just as effective as putting keys between your fingers, but it looks way cooler."
935,5,"Much better than the flimsy one I bought at the grocery store.  Slices strawberries and kiwis with ease.<br />Could use a larger one for peaches, etc.  Oh... it slices eggs nicely too."
936,5,I like these because they work well and take up less space in my freezer than an ice cube tray.
937,5,"This kit was fun, easy, complete, and, in the end, tasty. Directions were simple and well written, with photos. I did look at a few blogs with pictures about making mozzarella before I started, but had no trouble reading the directions. I was not happy with the thermometer supplied because I think it is difficult to hold and read while trying to stir a pot of hot milk, but I already had a digital meat thermometer in the drawer so I just used that instead. I am very happy with this product and will use it a few times a month to make my own cheese. I will also be purchasing some of these kits for friends as gifts."
938,3,"I did not rate this product any lower because it was just what I was looking for.  I could not rate it any higher, because I purchased it as a gift for someone else, so I do not know if it is functioning well.  The person stated it was just what he wanted."
939,5,"I needed a replacement for my Krups Bistro combo machine model 867. This fits perfect! Works with the pause feature. It's well made and pours the coffee nice. I'm grateful to another reviewer on the other Medelco carafe model GL210 with a flat lid sold on amazon, who said that it didn't work with the Bistro 687 and to look for a model that had a CP at the end. That is this very model. The key is the raised edge on the lid for it to work with the pause feature. I was hesitant to order cause this one had a bad review. I'm so glad I went ahead and took a chance. I'm very pleased with my purchase."
940,5,"I read many reviews here before buying this machine.  I have now had it about 6 months and use it practically every day to make \\""nutriblasts\\"" and it has NEVER leaked.  I blend baby spinach, about 1/2c water and whatever fruit I have on hand. As suggested in other reviews, I do not overfill the blender jar. I put in stuff up to the line and pulse it down, then add the rest of my fruit and continue blending until smooth.<br /><br />What no one else has mentioned, and I think is the key: NEVER PLACE THE BLADE ASSEMBLY IN THE DISHWASHER!!  It clearly states not to do this in the instructions, but let's face it, we're all lazy and the natural inclination is to put the lid on the top shelf of the dishwasher along with the jar. If you do this,the gasket inside the lid will stretch out with the heat of the dishwasher, and the seal will no longer be tight.  Before you know it, your Nutribullet will start leaking. This happened to me with my regular blender, which is why I knew not to do it."
941,4,"Love this size and the flexibility of it.  Was hoping the holes were a bit smaller though, but the price was hard to beat."
942,5,"I was a little skeptical at first but after using it, it works great.  It grinds the meat and the bones and it is easy to clean and put together."
943,5,"I have been wanting this cookie jar for a long time now; and it was just purchased for me as a gift.  It is larger than I had originally expected, but it is perfect.  Such a cute addition to my kitchen counter!  So colorful and an all around joy to look at!!"
944,5,"by far the best toaster oven we have ever used. only negative would be that a frozen pizza will not fit, but we rarely eat these so no biggie to us. toast, frozen waffles, and reheating left overs -  work better than anything else we've tried."
945,5,love the corn dishes the butter stays in dish and you can roll the corn for more butter corn fits good in the dishes
946,4,"This was recommended on a TV show by the host of America's Test Kitchen.  I have a rather powerful microwave and it took longer than the directions state to result in crisp chips.  But it does work.  I did not purchase the mastrad mandoline so perhaps I haven't sliced the potatoes thin enough.  Still, I like the result."
947,4,"Does a clean cut of the can, so much so that you think it didn't do anything but look closer and the top is loose...very handy and great price."
948,5,"This is a fun product! Who wouldn't want to have giant ice balls in their drinks? The ice ball molds are very pliable, making it easy to pop the ice right out, once frozen. And pouring water into the mold is so easy, my 6yr old son helped me fill it up so even a kid can do it. Not only can you make water ice cubes, you could also make multiple colored ice balls for a really fun and colorful party beverage or make a mixture of fruits, juice and yogurt and pour it into the balls, freeze, and place on an ice cream cone for a healthier Summer treat! There are so many ideas.<br /><br />I received the Epica Classical Ice Spheres in exchange for my review, you can read the entire review here: [...]"
949,5,We frequently have coctails outside by the pool. These glasses keep our martini's cold even in Florida's summer heat... well at least a lot longer. Beautiful glasses and well made. Highly recommend!
950,5,I bought three of these racks to store the dozens of spice jars I have. All three are hung on an inside of a door.  Now I don't have to search for several minutes to find a spice I know I have because it kept coming to view when I was looking for a spice when I was looking for one the last time. The racks are easy to hang and are made much better than many products manufactured today.
951,4,"This is a great little high performing compact microwave.  We have it built into our cabinets, and love that it is compact.  It does fine with all types of heating."
952,5,The spinner works well to clean and dry leafy vegetables.  Great for &#34;farm to table&#34; produce. I recommend this product
953,5,"I use my small green Tupperware Tumblers all the time. If I have a cup of tea left, goes into one with the lid for tm.  I use it to shake and mix my red drink, I take it traveling with me and store creamer, Chia seeds, etc. Everyday, I am glad I ordered them!"
954,4,I had used this to grind up chucks of chicken into a paste for a cat who lost all it's teeth.  It's great.
955,5,"I bought the lunch bag, pencil bag and serious backpack in the pink horse pattern. They are great... lots of room and everything matches. My granddaughter is thrilled with the pattern and style..."
956,4,"This carafe keeps coffee hot for many hours if you follow directions, and it looks really nice with the red color stainless steel.  I also noticed it doesn't drip after you pour out the coffee. Finally, the size is perfect as you can almost fit a whole pot of coffee in it."
957,5,"This is the best cork remover you will ever use.  Seriously.  No more dealing with awkward situations where you have to pull really hard  and then pull too hard and accidentally smack your face and get a black eye and then you have to make up an excuse that you fell down some stairs rather than admit what really happened.  Instead, you just get some sweet, sweet lever based action that pops that cork right out.<br /><br />Pros: Removes corks like nobodies business, looks kind of sweet.<br />Cons: Makes it easier to drink too much, because the challenge of removing corks is gone."
958,2,I would rather not say any more as I'm really disappointed in Panasonic as they are one of my favorite makers of electronics.
959,4,This item is great and cooks my noodles perfectly every time. In order for it to fit into my cupboard I flip the lid and slide it in.
960,5,"Bought this to replace plastic bowls for everyday cooking and storing use.  They were everything I expected and the quality was a surprise. The lids fit tight which is a plus and the glassware is easy clean up.  If you do put something with tomato sauce in the bowl for storage with the lid on, the lid will stain from the tomato sauce, but this doesn't matter after cleaning, it still works great just looks funny with the stains.  I can't say enough about the thickness and quality of the bowls themselves. I am so happy with the purchase."
961,3,The turntable on this machine stopped.  Were told to go to local Sears.  They said they'd get fixed or replace. We got back same machine and found teeny note that said to have replaced by seller.  Since I cannot find the place to give a great big SHOUT OUT TO 4-to-1 Sellers here it is -- they were WONDERFUL.<br /><br />Am annoyed by the continual buzzing to remind me that something has finished cooking and find the popcorn setting to not be forgiving ... lots of &#34;chocolate&#34; popcorn when snack sized.
962,1,"I ordered this set,but very disappointed in it everything sticks to it. Want to return it but was told only will get some money back because its been pass 30 days,so ended up keeping it . Do not recommend it buying it at all chip quality"
963,2,Ordered as replacements they don't stay chilled long enough to finish the drink; reason instructions state to freeze 'upside-down' is due to mug bottom bowing when frozen so mug can't stand on a flat surface without rocking and spilling drink when full.<br /><br />Would definitely not purchase again
964,3,"I purchased the chargers to be part of the centerpiece at my daughters wedding.  The chargers were flimsier than I expected but they looked okay.  My main problem with them was due to the lack of proper packaging.  Of the 24 ordered, only 17 were usable.  Luckily, I only needed 15 but it is ridiculous to have only  70% of the items arrive whole."
965,5,"I bought 4, gave 2 away for a Bday gift to a friend. He loved them as well. I serve my liquor shots with the Brain Shaped Ice Cubes floating on top of the shots. It's a hoot!<br /><br />Arrived quickly, and none were broken."
966,1,"I bought this product to help me lose weight and to keep my food from touching - I HATE when my food touches each other. It worked okay for about a week but then I began to notice that it kind of looks like an angry three eyed alien and it frightened me and it also triggered emotional eating. I eat when I'm scared, and I also eat when I'm angry - and I was VERY angry when I realized that I could no longer use this product that I paid $7 for! I have gained 10 pounds in the past six weeks just from the feelings this thing has caused me - DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT!"
967,5,"This is a cute and little kettle. Heats water much faster than our 1100 Watt microwave oven. With an automatic shut-off and won't heat to dryness, it's perfect to use, keep handy on the kitchen counter, or use in a college dorm room."
968,5,really cute dinosaur mold- my only regret is that I didn't order 2!  I made some cute candy with this mold.
969,5,"I tried 3 different electric openers, and all failed -- so I returned to this classic. Foil cutter works perfectly with one twist, corkscrew and puller are perfectly easy. And, the price is right! I'll never again be swayed by oversize, overpriced electric gadgets."
970,2,"I bought this thinking that this would be a good mug to carry to and from work, and boy, was I mistaken. It's thin and not very well insulated, doesn't really hold all that much, and the lid is flimsy. It isn't as cool looking in person as you think it's going to be when you're buying it. Really not worth it."
971,5,I purchased these for my son's superhero party as cupcake toppers.  The kids loved that they had a ring to take home!
972,5,"I make cupcakes on the side and love to present new and exciting flavors for my clientele.<br />I have recently had an order for strawberry cupcakes, and couldn't let them down!<br />Although a dram isn't much in the world of baking, it's enough for two batches of cake mix.<br />I personally use half of the dram for the cake, and the other half for the frosting.<br />You really don't need much with the full rich flavor that you get from this product.<br />I would definitely recommend it to ANYONE looking to flavor their deserts and enjoy something delicious."
973,2,It is a very crude and cheap version  of the expensive type and the blades are not shaped correctly which causes your knives to be bluntened.
974,5,I've managed to lose over 15 pounds using this scale. It's compact size allows me to keep it on the counter and ready to use anytime I have the urge to eat anything. It turns on quick and gives me accurate readings so I know exactly what I am consuming. Wonderful product for the dieter and the chef of the household!
975,5,I got tired of pinching my hand in the opener I had. This opener didn't come with instructions but I didn't need them. It's very easy to use. No more pinched hands
976,1,"Though many decorating tips were provided, but the pressure required was too much, because of the air passage.<br /><br />Too much of work, so returned it."
977,5,"I bought these since my husband and I never purchased steak knives when we first got married. They are super for their price. They don't get a lot of use, so I can't say how durable they are, but over all, I'm quite happy with them."
978,5,"With all the knives in my kitchen, I did not own a sharpening steel.  So, my dear husband would take those knives that needed sharpening and work his magic on them in his workshop.  Well now I have something within a quick reach and sharpen away to my heart's content!  I like the quick results and it's easy to use."
979,4,Nice product indeed.  Protects very well from the heat and it's great that it comes as a pair.  Would like these to be a little longer so they would protect my forearm.
980,5,Great set. I've had these for a month and have had no issues. I wash by hand and air-dry them on a dish rack. Great for every day use and/or a starter set.
981,5,I have been wanting one of these green pans and finally ordered one.  Mine is excellent-couldn't believe the bad reports I read. I ordered before reading the bad reports and was worried until I got mine and used it-I use it several times every day. The only thing is I wished I had gotten the smaller one but this works fine.  I use it every morning for eggs and  they NEVER stick. I have also used it for sauteing vegetables and pan frying fish.  Great quality as always!
982,4,"Had no complaints! It was just as i expected alot of writing space thanks very much, till the next order...."
983,5,"These ice cube trays are wonderful to use. I'm used to the old, plastic kind that cracked after several uses. I had to replace them over and over. These don't crack! The ice cubes were hard to remove from the old trays, but the cubes slide out easily from these silicone trays. My son is in college and has a small refrigerator with no ice maker in his dorm room, and these silicone trays work great for him. I've used them to make juice popsicles, too. The reservoirs are larger than the old plastic ones, the perfect size for popsicles. I sometimes will freeze lemonade and add the frozen cubes to a glass of iced tea. The proportion is perfect. Highly recommend these trays!"
984,4,"I bought this some time ago, and have had very few problems with it.<br /><br />Occasionally I do cram too much stuff in there, and have to reverse it, but that's what the button is for. It will juice softer fruits, but I do have to put the pulp through a few times before it's dry enough for me.<br /><br />It's also a little hard to clean, as I noticed when I first got it that there were a few bits of food stuck in hard to reach places. I've also thought that I washed it thoroughly and then found dried bits.<br /><br />The seller sent me a pen, juicing book and personal thank you note, and wonderful touch!<br /><br />Overall good product and seller!"
985,4,This has a pretty good flavor. We ran a snow cone stand and several kids prefer this diet flavor over the regular full-sugar flavors.
986,3,This gadget is just okay.  Not something I would recommend and something I put away after 2 uses.  Seemed to be more trouble than just putting it on a paper towel.
987,5,"I first got a 2-quart bowl when I bought the [[ASIN:B00028QMFM Corelle Fun Pack]].  I use the 28-ounce soup bowls that came with that a lot, but the 2-quart bowl is almost always in use.  It's big enough to mix cookie dough or almost anything else I mix, but it can be microwaved to soften butter or cream cheese.  It's just a perfect size.<br /><br />I really wanted another one, and the 1-quart bowls that come with this set were another item I wanted to try.  Sometimes my 28-ounce bowls are a little small, especially for salads or Mexican foods (on top of which we always add a big heap of lettuce).  At 32 ounces, the 1-quart bowls in this set are only a little bit bigger than the 28-ounce bowls, but the sides flair out, giving you more surface area at the top for mixing (or for food to cool).  I just couldn't be happier.  I got two of these sets so that I'd have four of the 1-quart bowls (and now I have a total of three 2-quart bowls...I'm in heaven!).<br /><br />At the current price of $20, this is a good deal, much better than the prices at Wal-Mart (currently $9 for the 1-quart and $10 for the 2-quart)."
988,5,"My wife and I had been searching for a very good spout. We purchased one and then a second for our Oil and Vinegar. Could not be happier, almost no drips, seals by the toggle and works well in different size decanters. IF you are in the market, look no farther and purchase it. You will not be disappointed."
989,4,"This is the 2nd Ronco that I have purchased.  My husband took the first one to work and it was used and abused so I had to buy another one for home.  I waited a while to purchase the 2nd one because the price was too high.  I am glad I waited because I found it much cheaper at Home Depot with free shipping.  If you are hesitant to buy this item, I would say definitely buy it if you are a foodie/cook.  If you are buying it because you like the idea, don't waste your money for a one time use."
990,5,These are my go-to pans any time that I bake.  They are made very well and cook evenly.  These are some of the best pans that I have ever owned.  They are thick and are commerical grade.  Can't beat the price!
991,5,"I broke my BF's Magic Bullet blade. The gasket, actually. So bought this affordable replacement, and it did the trick."
992,5,We bought this on recommendation of Cooks Illustrated test program.  It is very non-stick as is needed for crepe making.  The bottom is designed not to warp with heat.  This is very important for crepes also.
993,5,My husband is excited and loved brewing his first batch. I'm sure he will purchase more flavors as time goes by.
994,1,The stir doesn't work very well and the popcorn ends up burned! I used it once and I wasted my money. The best way to make popcorn is in a paper lunch bag in microwave. Then add your butter and salt! Yum!!
995,3,"The blades on these knives get dulled very fast. I've been using it for almost 3 years and I will be upgrading to a new and better set soon.<br />But for the price, this is the best you can get I think."
996,5,"Okay, okay...I have to admit that past ownership of the required food processor justified hand-chopping because the machine just couldn't do what I wanted. Now that I have this &#34;hoss&#34;, I can do better than hand-chopping in less time. Once I got accustomed to the power of this baby, I have made canning preparation a breeze. It is not that difficult to set up either! I highly recommend this machine for those folks who don't mind paying for quality products.<br />Dr.C"
997,3,I thought it was bigger than it is but it gets the job done . I use it for ice but you will probably need more than one of these .
998,3,Not the best looking - finish is dull and the color is grey but they are fine for the price. If your looking for fashion these are not for you. They are strictly utilitarian.
999,1,The first one i ordered quit working after a year.  The second one stopped working after only 3 months!  Quality of grind was good but pretty worthless when it stops grinding!  Amazon only allows returns after one month of purchase so buy if you are going to take a chance with this product better buy it from Costco.
1000,4,"We have this, and often is filled with grapes and berries.  Lets you wash the whole bunch when you come home from the store for easy storage and access, especially young kids."
1001,5,Great for tea.  No stray tea leaves floating.  Perfect mesh strainer.  Ordered large to have versatility to use in teapot.  Fits in standard mug very nicely. Very happy with this purchase!
1002,5,"This is the best travel mug I have used.  Like most reviews it will keep hot liquids very hot for 3 to 4 hrs.  The lid is well design and is pretty much leak proof.  The best feature is that it has two slots to drink from, so when you drink from one slot the other slot acts as a vent so you don't get a surge of hot liquid in your mouth like a lot of single opening mugs."
1003,5,Tha Hamilton Beach coffee maker's Coffee is the best tasting coffee. You can make it as strong as you want either changing water or coffee amount. There is no bitter taste. Recommended to son and he loves it.
1004,5,"We've had our Stir Crazy popper now for 12 years.  We absolutely love and use it very often.  Sadly it has been dropped several times, through no fault of the popper, and both handles of the bottom part have broken off.  Despite us dropping it, the motor worked just fine and still made great popcorn.  So we continued to use it constantly, but then the bowl was dropped and one of the handles on it broke.  So now it is really tricky to turn over after the popcorn has popped.  We have sadly parted with it.<br /><br />Even though it is easy enough to make popcorn by putting a 1/4 cup of kernels into a brown paper lunch bag and microwaving it for 1.25 minutes, we still will be buying another Stir Crazy.  The amount of oil needed to pop is negligible, you never get old maids (unpopped kernels) and the popcorn never burns.  The popcorn texture is wonderful -- crispy yet tender."
1005,3,"This lunchbox is adorable and my 6 year old loved it! Unfortunately, the zipper broke after 2 weeks and it is now useless! Wish the construction had been sturdier."
1006,5,I somehow lost the pressure float from my pot and didnt want to invest in another pot.  This repair kit saved the day.<br /><br />Thank you!!!!
1007,5,Works like a charm and very sleek look. I like the spoon rest on top of the lid. good value too
1008,1,"My goodness I am asked what do I think of this item? How would I know?!!!! Even tracking of this package is not yet available, ONE LONG MONTH after I bought it. Ask me again"
1009,5,"I first bought the Café Uno one cup coffee maker, then order this one.  We really like it and never opened the other one.  This one works great."
1010,5,So far only used the red and blue but the red is great. I had a hard time trying to get Wilton's red red enough not with this one. I bought because my friends son has a peanut allergy.
1011,3,We bought this to replace an old (still working) West Bend skillet. It doesn't seem to get as hot as the old one. Maybe in time we will get used to it. We like everything else about the skillet.
1012,5,I think this was a great price for the cooker I paid under $25.00 and it is all that I wanted.  It's sleek steel matches decor and does a great job... I've used it about 5x already.  Will be getting used on a regular basis (at least once a week)  I cooked sushi rice with it last night and it was perfect!
1013,5,"I love the beachy natural look of this, it holds my new coasters and looks good with my other decor."
1014,5,Works like a charm. The 'nonstick' surface could be a little better but it does an okay job. Highly recommended!
1015,1,I definitely had higher expectation since this was Rubbermaid so I was very disappointed when it broke. One drop by my son and it broke.  Very disappointed!
1016,5,This scale was worth the money! I also bought a calibration weight and have used it over the past year. The scale is right on every time!
1017,5,"same product/functionality as the bodum, but much less $!  I like having the metal frame and glass caraff so that the whole assembly can be set on an electric stove element on low and kept warm."
1018,1,"My wife purchased two of these bottles, and I use it everyday.  I like the look and the BPA free glass.  My only problem with it is the lid.  The cap that closes the mouth hole pops open really easily, and I've spilled it over-myself and my car often.  I think I would by a different design next time."
1019,5,"This replaces my Melita brewer and that is hard to do.  I read some reviews about it being noisy or slow.  They must be impatient or sound sensitive people that just don't like a good cup of coffee.There is some sound to contend with as this is steam brewer and might take a minute to get going -to me, that ain't slow.  It's all about the coffee and not the cup or the brewers. I love the foamy finish and think it enhances the coffee flavor. I reccomend that the 5 oz or 8oz settings be used to get full flavor, At 12 oz the brew is too weak for me. I keep this brewer on a stand next to my bed and ready to go. All I need to do is roll over and punch the brew button and wake up with a greagt cuppa'. I may even get another Suncana brewer for the kitchen. Amazon had the best price for this that I have found, besides, with Amazon, you order today and they ship yesterday!"
1020,5,"I love mine . . . no more plastic! I like to sip on ice water throughout the day and don't care for sweating glasses or melted ice, and these glasses do a great job. I haven't had any troubles with breaking, but I do try to put water in before ice . . ."
1021,5,I mistakenly threw away our control so I had to get a new one. Glad I found it here.  Works perfectly
1022,5,"love this item, you just lift to take down, lift to put back up,,,,keeps things off of the floor....strong, holds alot! good price."
1023,5,"Love these filters! I bought a nice pod coffeemaker at a great price on clearance and I soon found out why -- coffee pods are not easy to find in stores! Everything is k-cups now. So these filters allow me to use my favorite canned (or bagged) coffee in my pod coffeemaker. Just fill the filter with a scoop of coffee and clamp shut with a hair straightening iron. A curling iron or a regular clothes iron would probably work too. Or, if you can't be bothered with that, just staple it shut!"
1024,5,"All-Clad products are not cheap.  I asked for this for my birthday and my hubby made me order it myself because he couldn't make himself pay $150 for a single pot.  I didn't have this problem and am very happy that I got it...and so is he (now).<br /><br />I chose this pot for three reasons.  The first is that it is still made in the USA.  The second is that I am tired of replacing my cookware every 1-5 years and from what I gathered in other reviews, All-Clad products will survive anything short of an ACME anvil landing on them or a nuclear war.  The third (and most reviewable) reason I chose this particular product is that I have always wanted a stock/pasta/soup/etc. pot that has the removable strainer.<br /><br />For the past several years I've been using a pasta pot that has a built-in strainer in the lid.  On several occasions, I haven't held the lid on tightly enough and have dumped an entire batch of pasta into the sink.  This also happened when I used a colander set in the sink and poured the pasta/water into it.  Trust me...when dinner is ready except for the noodles and your entire family is waiting...starting over from cold water is NOT what you want to be doing.<br /><br />This pot is wonderful for preventing such unfortunate events (and the ensuing temper tantrums...not to mention the hungry hubby and kids) and is so easy to use that my 9 year old was able to strain the pasta while I was busy handling another emergency.  It was also great for making chicken stock from leftover roast chicken bones.  I didn't have to dirty another stock pot just to remove the bones, overcooked veggies and herb sachet.  It is also very useful for soaking beans.  When they were done soaking, I just strained them, dumped the starchy water and poured the beans back into the pot with other ingredients for soup.  If I had been just making beans, I could have kept them in the strainer and just added more water to finish the cooking.<br /><br />One of the wonderful features thatmy hubby thought was a flaw is the fact that the strainer basket does not go all the way to the bottom of the pot.  A lot of people don't use enough water when cooking pasta so it takes a long time for the water to heat back up after adding the pasta and it ends up really gummy.  The extra couple of inches guarantees a sufficient quantity of water AND has the added bonus of ensuring that nothing sticks to the bottom of the pot.<br /><br />In short, I recommend this to anybody looking for a versatile and easy to use pot that will last forever (barring invasion by Bugs Bunny or a hostile foreign country)."
1025,5,"Another top-rated item according to Cook's Country and I agree.  Well balanced, chops vegetables effortlessly and it goes right through a chicken breast bone. Great purchase."
1026,5,"I was in search of a small travel mug/cup that would fit my Keurig Mini Brewer AND in my cup holder. Not so easy! THIS CUP FITS THE KEURIG MINI!!! I was tired of making my cup then having to pour it into my travel mug! I actually found this exact one at Target for the same price (in store, not online at all) It fits PERFECTLY in the brewer if you remove the tray. With a 12 oz cup there's plenty of room for cream etc! It kept my coffee hot.  I don't know how long this keeps drinks hot, but I just need something for the 25 minute commute to work, not something to keep my coffee hot for hours and hours.  This little cup fits my needs perfectly.  I'm buying more for back up!"
1027,5,"The good:<br />Very good value.<br />The right size for most uses, can grind spices and herbs easily.<br />Inside and bottom of thee pestle are slightly rough facilitating grinding.<br /><br />The bad:<br />Heavy (well duh!).<br />Can be hard to clean if used to breakup candy etc.<br /><br />The Ugly:<br />Too large for really small jobs, too small for really large jobs (just right for most).<br />If you drop it on your foot you will most likely break a toe."
1028,4,"I purchased these cake stands for my business.  They were perect for dsplaying my bread, cookies and 3 cupcakes at a time.  They look exactly as they do in the pictures and are very pretty but please keep in mind that they are very fragile.  I had purchased 2 sets (which is a total of 4 stands) and have already broken 2.  One slipped out of my hand as I was washing it.  It completely broke into a million pieces.  The other I was drying with a towel in one hand while holding it with another and it actually broke in my hand because I guess my grip was too strong!?  I love the look of this product but just wish I could find something exactly like this, only stronger and not as fragile."
1029,5,"I do a lot of baking, this is a wonderful product.  I love the quality and the aroma and taste from this vanilla product."
1030,5,This is a vintage product and it came like it was new.  They were also very helpful when I contacted to make sure I knew what i was ordering.
1031,3,I'm sure I'll find a use for this omelet turner in my kitchen. The extra long handle is nice and the head is large. It will probably make a good stirrer.<br />The edge of the head is too thin and flexible. It can't be used as a scraper without curling. The edge is too thin and wont support the weight of an omelet without bending. The extra long handle doesn't provide and extra leverage in this regard. It's not a good tool for turning omelets.<br /><br />It looks cool hanging on the wall though.
1032,5,This bowl is a bit more volume than a cereal bowl.  It has nice depth and is solid and well finished.  I will most likely be buying several more.
1033,4,I recently bought the Fresh Saver and it has already brought value to my food purchases!!!  I have a Sam's membership and a new freezer and the food saver makes it all worth it!!  It pays for itself in salad savings alone!!!!!
1034,5,"I have only owned for a week so I cannot comment on durability.  But this smaller coffee pot is so terrific I would probably buy once a year if needed replacement.  I love the separate water reservoir which makes filling with water easy. The #2 coffee filter holder as a part of the pot lid makes cleaning equally easy. 5 cup is an overestimate as with other 4 to 5 cup coffee pots.  This coffeemaker makes two good (excellent, in fact) cups of coffee. Unlike other 4 cup pots I have owned, there is very little spilling when a cup is poured. I wish, like other reviewers, that it turned off automatically but a small complaint given the other advantages."
1035,4,"EL PRODUCTO ERA LO QUE ESPERABA, QUEDE CONFORME, ME GUSTO LA CALIDAD, EXITOS EXITOS EXITOS. EXITOS, EXITOS. BUEN PRODUCTO. SUERTE"
1036,5,"I've been using this cup for a few weeks now and it has more than passed my expectations, it has kept my coffee hot for more than 6 hrs, in my job I can't always sit there and drink my coffee, I'll need to walk away and come back to it multiple times plus the spill proof lid allows me to put it in my backpack/grip while I make my way to my travelling workstation, I definitely will recommend it to my friends and co-workers."
1037,4,"Initially purchased for my wedding.<br /><br />Definitely sturdy and versatile.  Yes, it is difficult to put together.  A rubber mallet, exacto knife, and a great deal of patience were required for assembly.  HOWEVER, once initial setup is complete, all the pieces come apart and back together fairly easily.<br /><br />Also, it's not &#34;pretty&#34;, but can be cleverly and creatively spruced up, if you have it in you to do so."
1038,5,This proved to be a great purchase for me!  I made chocolate covered Oreo cookies for my daughter's recent birthday party.  I followed the directions with preheating and with use.  No problems at all!  It was easy to use and easy clean-up too!  For me....I liked this over the double-boiler method or the microwave method.  I'm very happy!
1039,4,"It's a great fryer and has a larger capacity than expected.  The magnetic cord is a bit of a hassle, but it's probably required for safety."
1040,4,"My sister wanted to make sure her niece had the best nutritional options I could provide. So she bought me [[ASIN:B006SODTTQ Baby Bullet BSR-0801M Turbo Food Steamer]] and this product. When it arrived at the door the task seemed daunting to me. With all the things I have to do with my \\""new car smell\\"" baby how in the world am I going to make baby food. For 9 months my daughter's only milk option was breast milk and no jar baby food.

Yes, it took me an afternoon to review the books of both products and put everything together, and go to Whole Food and purchase my first items. But I would much rather too much information than not enough.<br />+ The items are really cute in design. I love the date-dail jars. The dates on them are great if you store enough for the freezer.

1041,5,I like this coffee maker filter because it is reuseable . . .  .<br />which is enviro mently friendly .
1042,5,"You can't believe how easy it is to uncork your wine bottle with this. Just about every time I use it in the presence of company, someone says &#34;I MUST have one of those!&#34;"
1043,5,"These spoons have been working great so far. They seem to be strong enough to not bend when used for ice cream (within reason), I appreciate that they're 18/10 for longevity, and all the edges are comfortable to grasp."
1044,4,"but still very good, and better than the recent spate of spontex blues which don't grip well causing me to drop many glasses while cleaning the kitchen.  So these are now my go-to gloves for kitchen and bathroom clean-up.  Very good."
1045,5,"Great material, great shape that maximizes dishwasher space. Nifty fire engine red color. Goofy tops with flaps like those on lumberjack caps but hey, I like goofy. Big relief to be using ethically constituted American plastic ware. No more bright plastic mugs from the People's Republic for me.<br /><br />I've been waiting ten years to find something this good.<br /><br />One negative: this softer luxurious plastic (does it have PVC in it?) likes dishwasher powder. Does anyone have an easy way to keep powder from clinging to my pretty red mugs?"
1046,5,"I have a Bialetti Moka Express 6 cup, this product arrived on time, undamaged and fit perfectly.  I have had it for more than month and there are no problems."
1047,4,"I needed to get use to this egg cooker.  I have gotten use to it and it works well.  The water lines on the cup used to measure the water for the cooker is hard to read even it you have perfect eyesight.  My eyesight leaves a lot to be desired,so it is extremely difficult to determine the correct water amount for the item I may be cooking.  Other than that I do like the egg cooker."
1048,5,"As this is a review for the replacement carafe, not the entire French Press, please go to http://www.amazon.com/OXO-Grips-8-Cup-French-34-Ounce/dp/B005LXOIY0 for reviews of the press itself.<br /><br />My wife broke the previous carafe after nearly a year of use when she dropped the press in the sink; glass and stainless don't play well together.  However, this replacement carafe arrived in a timely manner and was an exact fit for the press.  The white hash marks on the side to show the height of the coffee show up well against the dark liquid, and the height still properly matches the assorted pieces of the press.<br /><br />There are no cons.  If you are looking to replace a broken carafe and don't want to invest in an entire new french press, this is a worthwhile purchase.  I bought this two months ago, and have had no problems with it since."
1049,5,"This peeler is perfect, the scooper on the end is great for scooping out papayas and other fruits and veggies, the handle has a good heft in your hand, and the peeler is sharp enough to peel potatoes, pears, apples, and mangoes without even pausing. However, because of it's thick design I am in no danger of cutting myself. Will never be buying another type of  potato peeler again,"
1050,4,"This is a great little one cup coffee pot. Gets really hot. The cup even keeps it hot with the lid on for over a half hour or so.  The reason I didnt give it 5 starts is, the built in coffee filter lets a bit of the grinds through and you find them (or some sludge) at the bottom of your cup. I just bought some 1-4 cup cone filters and cut them down to size. So now there isnt a problem!"
1051,1,The blades are very sharp but they are all open and there is not guard(like a plate in a slicer) The vegetable/fruit has to stick to the holder else we cannot grate. It is very hard to get the vegetable to keep it on holder and hence defeats the whole purpose of this grater. Unless we use the holder we cannot even use this product.
1052,5,"I bought my Rival RC61 on a whim in 2004 for 15$ at a grocery store, I was 15 years old and had siblings to feed so this was a practical decision. I am 22 now.<br />It was my first rice cooker- I got it to save time and make multitasking while cooking easier because I had enough responsibilities to worry about without needing to juggle overflowing pots of rice on my stove.<br />Maybe not a good pot for family with pets or small children who can knock over the pot or open the lid and scorch themselves. I recommend a latched cooker for these families.<br />Value: A +<br /><br />Durability: A+<br />I have had this machine for 9 years! A decent beginner machine.<br />It's 2013 now and I have been happily cooking rice in it 4-10 times a month since I bought it.<br />I have read bad reviews where the Rival died in 4 months or less. Maybe I am lucky but my Rival has been very good to me.<br /><br />It is not an expensive or fancy appliance- do not expect expert quality, complicated dishes, or extreme luxury. Maybe not the machine for food snobs. It gets the job done and it is inexpensive.<br />Small pot size is good for small family or small portions of rice.<br />It is getting tired now but it has been a good little machine. :) Especially for the price. It has saved me a lot of time and grief versus stove cooking.<br />Only in old age (9yrs old) has the plastic cover on the switch cracked (cosmetic only), and the coil begun heating unevenly (wet spots and singed spots) but it still cooks. My machine is looking sad and is on it's way out. So now I am looking to purchase another machine- although I loved this Rival my next rice cooker is going to be larger more expensive machine with a latch lid and delay cooking option because I still feed many young people and need the convenience of pre planned meals and will not worry about knocking over the unit.<br /><br />Be nice to your machine: Store it when you aren't using it in a safe dry place, use the proper plugs and voltage, unplug it when you are done, don't let the machine sit turned on and empty, wash it carefully and non abrasively.<br /><br />Cooking: B+<br />It cooks 2 cups in about 45 minutes at the longest.<br />I recommend using room temperature water to begin cooking as hot water causes mushy watery rice and cold water takes too long.<br />6 cups refers to 6 cups cooked- this is really a 3 cup unit.<br />It might take a try or two to find the right amount of water for your rice to cook perfectly- this can be said for any cooker. I usually add water a knuckles length above what my rice is. Sometimes the directions in box for amount of water seem wrong- follow your gut. Each type and crop of rice is different therefor each has unique cooking times and amount of water.<br />Good rice is a matter of properly washing rice, and adding a bit of light oil to the water to reduce bubbling. Try using spiced oil for subtle flavor.<br />Stir the pot right before it is done to prevent rice browning and sticking to the bottom.<br />I have not steamed meat in my machine to cook it- though I have used it to reheat fish, dumplings and meat buns and all are good.<br />Warm feature works for a few hours very nicely, leaving it warming too long will make mushy soupy rice.<br />I wish I had time for fire pot cooking- I miss the crispy scorched rice at the bottom but electric is much easier.<br /><br />Cleaning: B<br /> Pretty easy. More expensive units are easier to clean or cause less mess.<br />Unit likes to bubble if you don't add a tsp of oil to water and wash the rice. Adding additional seasonings to boiling rice makes it harder to clean.<br /> Always soak off stuck rice and hand wash with non abrasive sponge so the non-stick coating will not wear off.<br />When the unit is young it may boil over a little and bubble all over the lid- do not worry. Set it on a cooking tin or lipped baking sheet to keep it from running all over the counter.<br />Always unplug after use because there is no off feature. Remember while cooking keep heat and moisture sensitive items away from the cooker as all cookers let off steam.<br /><br />Good Luck & Enjoy! :)eature. Remember while cooking keep heat and moisture sensitive items away from the cooker as all cookers let off steam.<br /><br />Good Luck & Enjoy! :)"
1053,5,"Exactly what I was looking for, very sturdy plastic.  The various sizes are great and you can not beat the price."
1054,5,"A very good kitchen tool, everyone should have one. It just makes potatoes, onions, and everything else such a breeze. Get it."
1055,5,Well made cutters which nest easily and store nicely. The many different sizes give you lots of options. Fun for kids!
1056,5,"This was purchased for a friend, she loves it, knows how to use it and works great for creative ideas."
1057,5,"I used to be a strawberry abuser!  I would purchase them, and put them into the fridge, where they would then get moldy and be thrown away.  It had gotten to the point where my husband told me I was no longer going to be &#34;allowed&#34; to buy strawberries (like that ever stopped me).  When I saw this, I had to give it a try.  I have 2 daughter that LOVE strawberries, and, yeah, I was lazy about doing it before.  My finger would get pruney and my girls would have them devoured before I even threw away the empty container.  I knew there had to be an easier, faster way to complete the act of washing, coring and slicing strawberries.  I mean, isn't necessity the mother of all inventions?  So, I figured I'd give this a try.  i LOVE it! I can put the strawberries into the colander while running water over it.  I usually core (or de-stem, or &#34;cut the green off&#34;) all at one time, then slice the strawberries SO fast!  I can do a container in about 7-10 minutes.  I know this because suddenly the bus will be on the way, and I remember I was supposed to cut strawberries.  They make very thin slices, and the entire process is very fast!  I am now, once again &#34;allowed&#34; to buy strawberries.  LOL!"
1058,5,"Even though I did not used them hard, it's pretty obvious they were made with good workmanship. I would buy them again."
1059,4,This worked very well on the dog treats I made for our puppy...assuming it would also work well on cookies.  :-)
1060,5,I love it so much when I am cooking that I ordered a second longer one for the other side of my kitchen where I prep my ingredients!<br />My legs and feet have never been happier.
1061,5,"Yes. I made that up..but what else can I say about an ice cream scoop besides the boring stuff? (sturdy, easy to use, comfy to the wrist..yadda..yadda.. ) Aw well, I suppose that did it."
1062,1,"AND WITH THOSE WORDS BURNED INTO MY BRAIN, I DEFIED MY OWN INSTINCTS, AND BOUGHT THIS PIECE OF JUNK!<br /><br />Grandkids killed my other waffle iron, probably tried to roast their hamster or something like that, so gazing at the Amazon reviews on this thing (Oster Belgain waffle maker, CKSTWF2000) I decided, \\""How can I go wrong?\\""<br /><br />Got the device, etc. etc., and proceeded to make some waffles.  Put the control midpoint and waited for the green \\""Ready\\"" light to come on. Poured batter on grille, and waited for the light to come<br />back on.  It does.  Removing the cover, what should greet me but a sodden, white mass of dough.  Tried it again with the control set to the maximum.  This time I get a sodden white mass with a brownish tint where the impressions go.<br /><br />In short, junk.  Won't get hot enough to do the job so you get no waffles.  Examined the carton for evidence of my troubles.....Ah, there it is.  Made in China!"
1063,2,"From the first use, the lid did not like to stay down. While the removable lid certainly makes cleaning easier, it never quite snapped properly in place, seemingly just a little to large for the slots it's supposed to fit into.<br /><br />Talking to T-Fal customer service, I was told, &#34;Yeah, they do that,&#34; and given instructions for a laborious process of sending it back in for repairs that might not even fix it. Our last fryer was a T-Fal, but we've returned this and received a refund and will be looking elsewhere for a replacement. While the prices are better on Amazon, I want something I can hold in my hands and test out before I pay for it.<br /><br />Caveat emptor."
1064,5,This is an excellent product. The refurbished unit looks brand new. We love it.<br /><br />Very solid build quality. a a
1065,5,Simple to use and saves your wrists. Opens wine in a flash and no more pulling--no more wine bottles slipping out of my hands while pulling out the cork. I would not be without it!!
1066,3,"Good product, but did not meet my expectations of getting a pot of grease hot enough to deep fry foods outside to avoid smelling up the house. Should have purchased a heavy duty deep frier instead."
1067,5,Okay we go this to test for our line knife at our restaurant.  This this is still sharp as if it were new.  It truely is sharp people aren't lying about that.  The handle is super night but who cares a good cook can cut with any handle especially if its just for cutting thru semi soft bread..
1068,5,"These are much, much better than the plastic ones you buy at the big box store, and for the same money."
1069,5,"I bought these for valentine's day to make candies, cakes, and other craft items.  They work beautifully.  I was worried they wouldn't come out of the pan, but they did fine as they were sprayed with non-stick cooking spray."
1070,4,Bought this to process the 4 elk from this season.  Worked better than my friends old and tired dedicated grinder.  Not as good as the new dedicated grinder from Cabela's but didn't cost nearly as much.
1071,5,Perfect fit.  Allowed me to continue to use my old ice tea maker.  The new pot is a clearer plastic and the turqoise is a nice change from the old yellow one.
1072,4,"My only complaint about about this product is the exorbitant amount of postage charged to ship it.  Considering that this is a small, lightweight product which was shipped in a padded envelope, I think over $10 is ridiculous.  I would not do this again!"
1073,4,bought these to go along with the Rachel Ray orange pans. As long as the kids use these the pans will last longer.
1074,5,"They are just right for single serving dishes, individual servings of dips, create crab dip. I have not tried any desserts yet but will."
1075,5,great stuff good flavor added some honey it was great keep up the good work cooper i would like to see yous come out with new flavors
1076,5,"This is a classic stove top percolator that will make a great cup of coffee. The glass seems durable, but I do not like the plastic parts. I have used it a 2 dozen times so far since I have gotten it and its held up so far. I got this from someone for Christmas, and love it so far. To avoid getting coffee grounds in your cup you need to have coarse ground coffee and/or use a filter. It can be tricky to find a filter to work in this, but as long as you do not use fine coffee grounds you will be okay. You could always strain your coffee when you pour it in your cup. That would be a great item for them to throw in the box to make it even better.<br /><br />I am just glad they still sell stove top percolators! This one seems really nice."
1077,5,I bought this as a gift for my brother-in-law and his new fiancee (I filled it with wine and snacks as well). The quality was wonderful and they are so happy with it.  They said it was one of the best gifts they'd received in quite a while.
1078,5,"I bought the set (salt and pepper) for my wife as a gift and she was thrilled. The quality is there, the finish was excellent. I wish the handles fit more snugly but they do what they advertise. Light years over plastic parts grinders."
1079,5,"Yes this is the best looking, Strongest and ideal.  You cant go wrong with this purchase.  You will be very happy with them."
1080,1,"Low quality for too high price  very disappointed, must return you should reconsider offering this product, it is not a good value."
1081,1,"First off I must admit that despite my 1 star rating, the 571 is truly the best slicer on the market. Fruit-Art's \\""Nicer Slicer\\"" is a piece of trash and even the 471 model pales in comparison to Hutzler's newest life changer.<br /><br />To be fair I am a bit biased and feel almost personally violated... let me explain.<br /><br />My problem is with the fact that creating and selling this slicer at such a low price point, Huztler is doing a huge disservice to those of us still training or recently graduated in the field of Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana Preparartion, or as most people lovingly refer to us- Banana Doctors.<br /><br />Now it's long been no secret to us that despite all the studying, tuition costs and the research papers, once you learn it, Banana Slicing is relatively simple. It's similar to riding a bike in that once trained it never leaves you. We knew this, but kept faith in our trade because it was simply too costly and trying for the public to even think about opening their own bananas not to mention slicing one!<br /><br />But ever since Hutzler changed the game and took away all of the technological road blocks anybody can do it... I mean with this thing you'll probably be able to do half a banana after you watch disc 2 of the instructional video. I mean disc 3 is where you really learn the theory but you'll be set by disc 2 (they really should have taught theory first though, it completely changes your technique... but that's why the pro's are still better!).<br /><br />It's just that these days everybody takes the easy way out, you know overnight success, viral videos all that stuff! And people like me who have spent their lives loving and learning a craft- no an \\""ART\\"" as honored and specialized as Musa Prep should be able to find a good job out of college. I'm lucky I learned on the old analog equipment cause when they went pro-digital we had a problem, but now that this thing is going consumer and plastic... geez.<br /><br />Hopefully when the zombies come and the power fails Hutzler will go out of business and people who don't own a 571 will be begging me to join their clans. They'll have to hand over their women though!!<br /><br />Money won't matter and the Banana Man needs to GET PAID!!"
1082,5,I was looking for just plain matches to have around the house.  I don't care for using wooden matches so these were perfect for my needs.
1083,5,"I recently purchased the Ozeri ZK011 Precision Pro Stainless-Steel Digital Kitchen Scale. This scale is easy to use, accurate, and easy to clean. I have had no issues with it. The different wgt designations, ounces or grams, are invaluable in following recipes. I would highly recommend this purchase for anyone."
1084,5,"There is no better Travel mug made.  I have put coffee in this mug at 7am and it is still hot enough to drink at 2pm!  If you are looking for a travel mug that will not spill and keep your drink hot, then look no further!"
1085,3,I bought this as a gift for my man. He loves tea. We used it a couple of times after Christmas and then slowly stopped using it. It doesn't hold that much water and takes a long time to boil. We have a tea kettle that holds more and heats faster so this gift was replaced on the oven.
1086,3,"Smaller than I thought it would be.  Ok but I would really like a bigger one, you have to refill it too often."
1087,5,Great product to make healthy treats! We use these to make frozen smoothie pops. Great for kids and adults alike!
1088,5,That was a perfect gift for my two year old grand daughter. She is suddenly in love with Bambi and Thuper!!!!
1089,5,This Rubbermaid 18-piece storage container set is excellent in its quality and usefulness.  I really like it and would recommend any of Rubbermaid's storage sets.  Very economical for what you get as well.
1090,4,"Bought this for my son, he loves it.  Didn't do 5 stars because I don't like the zipper on the top.  It is 2 zippers you pull at the same time.  My son sometimes has a hard time getting it open or shut. Overall, I like it though."
1091,5,"I was so pleased with this mug. It's a really nice size....much bigger than I thought, and the picture is beautiful!  I gave it as a gift and he LOVED it!  I"
1092,5,"Wanted to get bottles I could use for my filtered tap water vs having to buy drinking water that isn't even in BPA-free bottles.  I also have issues with arthritis, and wanted a handle and have a BPA free container...These are PERFECT...did a lot of searching!  The label peels off cleanly so you get a clear mug...not too heavy, and exactly half of one day hydration requirement, and plenty for me to quench my thirst as a diabetic. Only wish they came in slimmer version for the car!"
1093,2,"did not work like i expected  i am taking my time to submit this review, what good does it do"
1094,5,"I've used it for years.  I wish it were less expensive though.  And shipping is too much.  The last time I purchased it, I was able to get the larger."
1095,3,"They dont nest...so storing them takes up too much space.  I store them with the lids on, so I can at least stack them...wasted space."
1096,1,"I bought this for a gift & was embarrassed when I saw them trying to use it!  I thought it would be good because you could use your own knives and it would be safe for older kids to use.  The plastic is pretty flimsy so the knife does not stay in the slot. You have to have large hands to kind of hold it all together and we had large bagels, not extra large, and we had to squeeze it into the holder."
1097,5,With lots of family and friends visiting we could never stay ahead on fresh coffee----this great coffee maker has changed all that----now I even get to drink coffee and visit ---
1098,5,I make jam every summer and this has made it so much easier to do! I'm not wasting as much strawberry now either.
1099,5,"This is a great and stylish tea-kettle. I owned another one Delonghi kettle from Metropolis collection for 8 years and had no complaints. Now it is time for a change, and I am glad to find Kmix."
1100,5,it's exactly what i wanted and the price can't be beat. Definitely a winner.  I would suggest this to anyone who is in need of a crockpot.
1101,5,"If you are like me, after you've tried all the samples that came with it, you really only have 3 or 4 favorite k cups that you and your family use with your Keurig. While the carousels spin nicely to make selections, if you drink the same few flavors, you really don't need a carousel taking up all that counter space. These containers are a perfect way to store your k cups. I don't like a lot of kitchen clutter, so I put these in a kitchen cabinet and they're perfect. When I buy new k cups, I just fill them from the top, so stock is rotated effortlessly. I originally ordered a set of two, but liked them so much, I ordered another set. The construction is sturdy and they have a round hole at the top that you pop a k-cup into that identifies what is in that bin."
1102,2,"It's pretty, but it leaks coffee, and will be hard to wash.  It's not very functional as a travel mug."
1103,5,Its a good size that can fit into my regular size tote bag or cross-body handbag. It keeps warm for longer than 7 hours. Definitely a great product to be invested.
1104,2,The discription on inter net was not good and I felt that it should have been larger than it showed.
1105,5,Did exactly what it was made to do. I washed it in the dishwasher on the top rack with absolutely no problems. (washed the cork thingy by hand tho).
1106,5,"really like this product - found smaller version at T.J.Maxx and wanted to see what Amazon had to offer.  I like the larger size.  The cap and large mouth opening are wonderful - easy to open, no spill - fantastic - would recommend!"
1107,3,I received the Espresso Tamper wrapped in a plastic bag then in a paper bubble wrap envelope. The product is marred on the large end and scratched up. It is a new Tamper and I feel for the money paid and especially the cost of shipping I should have received a quality tamper.<br />Unhappy Customer!
1108,4,Worked great to flip the whole fillet on the grill.  Sharp edge can get under the fish easily to reduce sticking on the grate.
1109,5,"IT was much more than I expected. The quality is excellant, and you could not beat the price anywhere. Would recommend this to others"
1110,3,"I tried freezing them they got very cold at first, but did not remain cold for very long and did not chill the drink enough."
1111,3,"Overall, water taste the same which is great. The filter don't seem to last that long. First week or so, it filters easily, after that it takes a while for it to filter water."
1112,1,Was so excited to try the new glass; carefully placed the ice ball into the glass at which point the glass immediately shattered.  Never even got to use it!  :(  Will be returning it this week.
1113,4,Quite happy with this tamper. It's cheap. I only needed it as a temporary fix until my rattleware came back in stock and it did the job/
1114,5,"I originally bought this butter dish for our camper and loved it so much that I bought another one for the house.  It is HEAVY like glass, well maybe not quite, but it is tough like plastic.  The first day I had it my husband dropped it on the floor accidentally and the only thing harmed was the butter in it.  I like it also because the closure doesn't allow refrigerator odors to get onto the butter."
1115,5,"I am still finding out new ways to use it, I tried the broccoli soup and it was a disastrous, but my morning shakes are coming out great, putting Kale and spinach and it is chopping it up so you do not get the chunks but get the energy. For the price I love it."
1116,5,"These salt and pepper shakers work very well, But the best thing is they look great on your dining room table."
1117,5,"This can opener opens cans.  There's really not much more to say.  I've bought can openers willy-nilly at the store on a few occasions, and more often than not, I can't get them to work.  I'm not sure if it's me or cheap products or what, but I was so frustrated that I finally decided to hit the ever useful reviews on Amazon :)  Bingo, this one's the only one left in my drawer because it's the only one of the last 3 I bought that actually works, every time.  My one complaint is the way the sharp edges work.  My last opener, which I absolutely loved until I broke it, cut off the whole top with the rim and all.  For some reason I found that much easier/safer to deal with.  This one cuts out an insert and leaves a really sharp edge inside the rim on the can - so be careful when you're washing those empty cans out."
1118,5,"ordered product to match red apple decor in kitchen.  quality product, no problems @ this time.  Had previous problems with other kitchen can openers.  will see how long this item will last.  BEAUTIFUL COLOR, EASY TO OPERATE, RAPID SHIPMENT FR AMAZON.COM."
1119,4,"I have three Shun knives in mine and it fits nicely on my counter. Have not needed to clean it so far, we'll see how it holds up."
1120,1,"Update: Replacements were just as bad. Tried ordering from different seller too. Still contaminated. Obviously they were not manufactured, packaged, or stored properly. I recommend a quality known brand that you can trust.  These do not look like the photo. They come shrinkwrapped which has obviously allowed moisture to accumulate. Every plate is full of big black polka dots which is actually mold. As for the use, they look like they might have held up fairly well for many uses. They look sturdy, but I threw them out due to the mold and odor without using them. I plan on asking for replacement and will update review when they arrive."
1121,2,"We bought this to use as kitchen storage and find that, when it gets loaded up, the chains open up and come apart.  Ugh. Pretty and functional for light use."
1122,1,"Received this as a gift. As I was washing it for first use, warm soapy water, soft sponge, I saw the decorative designs sliding down the surface. Garbage. Going back to Amazon."
1123,1,"The search for a good pie shield continues; this ain't it.  It does not fit a 9.5&#34; pie, so I used a bit of foil to bridge the gap.  The portion under this shield was badly burned, the foil was fine as usual.  Dangit.  Amazon was absolutely golden on the return process, they get 5 stars for their part, but this pie shield is junk.  How are some reviewers getting great results?  I am stumped."
1124,5,"This was a present for my wife she love the colors , Now we both  drink have Margaritas Thanks you"
1125,5,love it. exactly what I was look for.  If fit my blender.  look for the straight line for holding the blender
1126,5,"The WearEver commercial nonstick sheet pans are among the heaviest, thickest sheets I've found for sale.  As a result they heat very evenly and they don't warp or twist in the oven.  I haven't had mine long enough to say anything about the durability of the nonstick coating, but if you don't use metal utensils on them they should last well.  They claim to be dishwasher safe, though I prefer to hand wash mine.  These are now my favorite cookie sheets."
1127,5,The first roaster was damaged & they sent another one in fine shape.  Thanks  W/order more thru here.  thanks again
1128,5,"I ordered one of these to see what type of quality they were. After using it a couple of times I was quite impressed, especially liked the foil cutter attached to the top that easily pops off and on and works quite well. I like them so much that I ordered 20 of them to send out for customer Christmas gifts."
1129,3,"These plate holder should be called saucer holders. They are well built and sturdy but not a plate size.Although we will keepthem for some use , they are not what I thought they were. I also ordered a larger set of plate holders at the same time but have not received them as yet."
1130,1,"I bought this item because it is advertised as oven-safe up to 500 degrees.  My first use of it was in a 475-degree oven.  Twenty-minutes passed, and then -- Crack!"
1131,5,"Expensive, of course! Worth it? Absolutely!<br />I LOVE this copper pot rack! I especially enjoy having the warmth of copper in my kitchen, which adds a &#34;decorator touch&#34; like no other.<br />I also enjoy having the extra, new-found storage in my cupboards, that this pot rack has freed up!<br />Would I buy this item again?<br />In a word, ABSOLUTELY!"
1132,4,I have looked in vain for several years to replace my plastic  see-through holder.  I was thrilled to find this one.  They aren't very strong but just right for me.  I've learned to put only the loose-leaf page or a copy of the page in the holder.  I hope it holds up.
1133,4,"We have to provide lunch for DD's daycare so I purchased one of these, and have been using it daily for over a year. Given the abuse it's endured (being dropped frequently, diswasher) it's held up remarkably well. The thick plastic bottom has not stained, warped, or acquired any odd odors. I can see some small cracks forming on the bottom part, so it might be nearing the end of it's life, but the lid could go on indefinitely.<br /><br />The container is great for a toddler lunch- it's plenty big (I can fit a half bannana inside) but shallow, making it easy to eat out of. DD is too young to carry her own lunch so fitting it into a backpack isn't an issue.<br /><br />My one downside is what others have mentiond- the partitions don't go all the way to the top, so it leaks if you tip it.  I work around it by avoiding liquidy things completely and using silicone muffin cups to contain smaller things, or things I want to stay crispy.  (The muffin cups reach the lid and are soft, forming a sort of a seal)  This would be a near perfect product if the partitions sealed, or if it had optional sealing inserts that you could drop into the 2 smaller compartments."
1134,5,A simply beautiful addition to my bar! I do a lot of entertaining and I just wish I had gotten it years ago.
1135,5,"I ordered this teapot with the creamer and sugar bowl set (comes also with a round, angled sugar spoon) and the tray.  What a magnificent tea service set!  I absolutely love it.  Not only is it beautiful to look at, it feels wonderful, too.  It is very high quality stainless  steel and I think Frieling is worth every penny.  There are no imperfections, seams or blemishes of any kind on any of the pieces.  The handles are perfect in size and a man's larger hand would be able to grip them comfortably.  The finish is a high shine but it looks very elegant and isn't over the top.  The lid of the teapot fits snuggly in the teapot--which is something that is important to me so it doesn't move around or fall off when you are pouring the tea.  The tray, creamer and sugar bowl are also of the same high quality material, finish and construction.  The sugar bowl comes with an adorable spoon that fits in to the notched bowl, the lid lies perfectly on top. While the creamer is the size of a regular creamer, you can still froth milk in it.  I'm very impressed with this set.  Frieling has surpassed my expectations.  I will update this review soon with details on how long the tea in the teapot stays hot.<br /><br />*UPDATE  I poured boiling water into the teapot and made tea.  One hour (I set a timer) later the water is still warm.  Not hot, but very warm.  The teapot pours very nicely and no dripping or spilling out when you pour, even when at the last of the tea."
1136,5,"when I purchased this skillet I was looking for a skillet that stood above the rest in quality. I thought it was a little pricey but took a chance because we had bought two others and you could not cook anything in them do to not enough heat or sticking to the pan problems. I got this for my wife for a gift, I really just could not take the complaining every night about her Walmart skillet, she hated it. When she received it and started using it she had nothing but good to say about this pan, it met every expectation and she uses it 5 days out of 7.<br />Charles"
1137,5,I purchased an icee machine and these are perfect for serving the frozen delight.  The kids love it and the straws make for a playful time.  Little shovels on the end of a straw.
1138,4,"The spice bottles are great. You can see how much is left, stack them up as you please. The labels peal sometimes, but that hasnt been a major issue in the kitchen."
1139,4,"This product was great as a center piece.  It was sturdy and easy to put together, I would definitely suggest it to others."
1140,4,I would recomend this to a family of two or less. makes a small amount of rice but it does work well.  It only hold 1.5 cups of uncooked rice.
1141,4,"First, I had to figure out that you have to press down with all your might on the lid while pumping out the air.<br />Second, seal did not keep. Poor poor design.<br />I put olive oil on the sealing areas and it worked better. But still leaks air after a day or so.<br /><br />UPDATE. I increased from 2 to 4 stars. It's working better now that the seal is seated after using it."
1142,5,I absolutely love this water bottle. I always used Nalgene prior to this water bottle so I'm use to the wide opening. Some people complained that it interfered with their noses..... I don't see how that is even possible. Absolutely love it.
1143,1,"but it was cheaply made, poor seals, ongoing flow and sprayed out sides all for a very unaffordable price and furthermore, it will not save you money over buying sodas..."
1144,4,"worked great and very cheap.<br />unfortunately, it broke in the mail but still works fine.<br />i would recommend it for everyone."
1145,4,"Nice rooster.  We are currently using it as a decorative piece rather than a cookie jar or other kind of dish.  There was a couple of very small chips along edge where lid fits on to body - not real noticeable - don't know if they occurred during packing, shipping or unpacking."
1146,3,"Description says \\""reef tongs\\"" but these are just a generic grabber. Unit works fine but metal cord and screws rust like crazy."
1147,5,"When I first laid eyes on these cool bags, I knew I had to have them. I mean, I have greenish tendencies. I go to the market with my tote bags, feeling proud of myself, but then I go into the produce department and there are all the little plastic bags to put the apples in, the kale, whatever; and I feel bad loading them up. At least I used to, until I found these.<br /><br />The mesh holds up really well. They're washable, but they don't get smushy messes in them like the plastic ones do - maybe because the produce can breathe. They're big enough to fit the kale in, even a bunch of beets with greens (cook those greens with a sliced apple - yum).<br /><br />The bonus comes when my shopping neighbors start to sidle over to ask where I got the bags. Now I'm starting to see them pop up here and there. It's fun to be a trend setter/greenie!"
1148,5,The tea mug is sawesome for lose teaa its no mess like when u use a teaball its very atractive and easy to clean a must have for all tea lovers.
1149,4,Refer comments on EZ-Cup. I am adding these words because I am required to have a certain number for this opinion.
1150,4,"The probe wire does not look like the one pictured above.  Instead, it is a gray silicone coated wire.  There are some good and bad parts to this change.  On the down side the probe and wire are only rated to 392 degrees Fahrenheit.  That means the maximum temperature your OVEN can be set to, not the temperature of the food.  If you have your oven set to 400 degrees then do not insert this thermometer, you will ruin it!  The benefit of the silicone probe is that it is water tight.  The curved design of the probe also holds the silicone/wire connection away from the steam, further improving the reliability of the unit over a pot of steaming water.  As someone who brews beer this is a huge plus; if you are a home brewer I would highly recommend this thermometer. The silicone also means you can wash it after sticking it in your pot roast without worry.  There is also an on/off switch on the underside of the unit, I'm not sure what the reviews claiming there isn't one are talking about.<br /><br />I have lost probe thermometers due to the metal probe wire coverings being shoddy.  They allow water in which destroys the sensors, and they allow the probe to spin on the wires and break the connection.  I will take the trade off of not being able to use it above 392 degrees for a unit that lasts through normal use.  I will update this review if my sensor over malfunctions.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Solidly built<br />Allows for calibration of sensor (in ice water)<br />Seems very accurate right out of the box<br /><br />Cons:<br />Only rated to 392 degrees Fahrenheit<br />No separate sensor for \\""oven temp\\"""
1151,4,I read reviews before buying this little puppy and it does exactly what it says it will do - fry food at the temp you set it at. Great product! Perfect for one or two people.
1152,3,"Unit arrived with defective oil drain valve and had to obtain a replacement. Oil simply would never drain from the supplied tank and valve.  Replacement appears to be working okay.<br /><br />Valve in the bottom of the fryer which drains into the plastic tray when oil cools, is potentially an Achilles heel to the unit which otherwise seems well built.<br /><br />The drain valve appears to work with a plastic plunger underneath activated by turning the control knob on the front of the unit to &#34;drain oil mode&#34;.  To prevent hot oil from draining from the metal frying tank into the plastic holding tray when you put the unit into &#34;drain oil mode&#34;, there is probably a mechanical temperature sensing mechanism in the valve.<br /><br />So overall the unit appears to be a reasonable size for 2 people/small amounts and the integrated oil drain/filtration system is a good idea, only a little more time will tell if the defective unit I received was a &#34;one off&#34; or something that frequently fails on this design."
1153,5,"I purchased this set along with a matcha bowl to make matcha tea. Both items are very well made. Of course the whisk is most susceptible to quality problems since it is more complex, but it doesn't have any problems. It is very well made. I just rinse it after use. Let it air dry for a few minutes, and put it back in its case. It still looks new after 2 dozen uses. I was thinking the tea might stain it, but not at all so far. I thought the thin bamboo whisk fingers might lose their shape when wet, but not at all so far. It appears to be just the right tool for the job."
1154,1,"This is the biggest waste of money. Out of the 25 \\""plastic wire glasses\\"" only *3* were usable! Most of them were pushed together so hard that they split open, other were simply crushed by the complete lack of packaging."
1155,3,"My original GF single grill was very, very hard to clean.  This GRP4 is very, very EASY to clean, thank you.<br />True to the reviews this one heats up very slowly, so slowly that in much the same way as a charcoal bbq, you need to start heating it up long before you cook.<br />I'm not sure if it ever gets hot enough to sear a steak but the easy disassemble, easy to clean feature is appreciated."
1156,5,"I bought this to replace the electric cookie press from Russel Hobbes that only lasted 6 months. First of all the price was great - it still cost less than the electric one even though I shipped it to South Africa.<br /><br />I was worried the handle would hurt my hand as I have a nerve problem but the handle is so easy to squeeze I can't feel it after my first batch of cookies. This is actually easier to use because one squeeze equals one cookie. You have to count the time with the electric press, which just keeps going and my cookies are never uniform.<br /><br />The patterns are very cute and I like every one I have tested so far. The shapes are just right.<br /><br />Overall I got exactly what I wanted with this. I didn't have to pay for random extras that I don't want, it is simple to put together and take apart, easy to clean and takes up little space. I am super happy."
1157,1,We didn't like this coffee maker because it doesn't turn off on its own. You have to turn it off yourself. I recommend the Bunn instead.
1158,5,bought as a gift for my daughter! they are now among her favorite choice in pans! she loves them! completely performed as expected...
1159,5,I bought this as a gift -- It had both  kitties & a ladybug which is what I was looking for!
1160,5,"I have had some very expensive grinderrs in the past. They all have worked fairly well, but they have had major issues. One of them that was part of the espresso machine was almost impossible to clean. Another one did not have a dial to adjust the coarseness of the grounds. This one is all that. It is so quick. You just pull the little drawer out and put the coffee in a coffee press. It is delicious. So easy to clean. I've only had it about a month, but so far I love it. Highly recommend."
1161,5,"Really good product, doesn't have the spike notches in the grinder part it's the one that looks like a swirled diamond which is the best one. Catches keep amazingly. Best grinder ever"
1162,5,"This is exactly what I was looking for. It's beautiful and works great. It's pretty small, but it will fit even larger mugs if balanced properly."
1163,3,"I noticed that the first few meals that I cooked in this cooker tasted...well I don't know how to describe the flavor so I will just say weird. The slow cooker that I had previously was the same size as this one, but this over cooks food if it is not at least 1/2 full (I called Hamilton Beach about this and was specifically told that it was designed to cook food best when it is half way full). Since our household is 2 adults and a toddler, I don't need to fix that much food very often. It is an \\""ok\\"" cooker, but I liked my actual Crockpot brand cooker better."
1164,5,This is a Christmas wish my daughter had on her list. Looks to be great quality and I am sure it will be put to good use by my daughter.
1165,1,"The shipping of the product was excellent, but I didn't purchase this product for the time it would take to get here. I got them because I was mislead to believe this muffin/cupcake pan was regular size not mini. It is very easy to be mislead by companies so always read customer reviews before purchasing."
1166,5,"Great product for cast iron skillet handles!  Protects hands from heat,, fits snugly, and the red pepper design looks great!"
1167,5,"We got this coffee brewer to replace an old & very worn out programable coffee pot & needless to say we are very happy.It is so easy to use & the coffee tastes so good.I seen some saying the coffee doesn't get very hot but we havn't had that problem.Of course it's not scalding but it's hot enough to where you do have to sip it or get a burnt tongue.We also love the single serve side,wonderful for when you just want a cup.The programable feature is very easy to use too."
1168,4,"This is currently my favorite juicer.  I love it and the quality of juice it produces.  I purchased specifically for greens, however, it handles other fruits/veggies nicely, including oranges, grapefruits, carrots, parsley, beets, etc.  It is easy to assemble -- 5 pieces and, quick clean up.  Manufacturer thought of everything!  Even has a reverse function in case it gets jammed.  Comes with a screen that fits the juice container to strain pulp, comes with a brush to clean the parts.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I am not sure about how well it homogenizes and because it has a small shoot which means you have to cut up produce in smaller pieces.  It also makes pasta, etc. but I cannot vouch for those features because I have not used them.  Otherwise, it is well worth the price."
1169,5,I received this blender stick as a Christmas gift in 2011 from my husband and I absolutely love using it.  I make a lot of soups and this gadget replaced my regular blender.  I have not used the chopper that came with it since I have a Cuisinart food processor.
1170,2,"I've had a couple of countertop grills like this one, and unfortunately this one is far from my favorite. Before this, I had the Cuisinart GR-4N, which I really liked a lot better. I'll break it down into the components that I felt were important.<br /><br />Size: This Frigidaire definitely has a large cooking surface, which is both a blessing and a curse. At first I was glad because we often like to grill extra long pieces of fish, or have a lot of smaller items that needed to be arranged like puzzle pieces on the Cuisinart. Unfortunately, it didn't occur to me that an extra-large grill also requires extra-large counter space. We grill several times a week so I prefer to keep it on the counter, and this just takes up a ton of space. While in use, there isn't much room next to it for food prep or service, and it has to be pulled completely out from under the cupboards to open all the way because otherwise it bangs into them (the hinge is not built to stay open unless the top grill plate is completely vertical). I think my kitchen is a pretty decent size, but it needs to be bigger if I want to accommodate this grill on a regular basis.<br /><br />Temperature: The increased size might be a reason, but it seems to take a very long time to heat up and never seems to get quite hot enough. Even turned up to High, I couldn't get those nice grill marks or that crisp outer sear that seals in the natural juices when cooking proteins. I usually like to throw my breakfast wrap on the grill press to seal it and get a nice little crisp outer layer, but by the time this thing was heated up my eggs were burned and it STILL wasn't hot enough to really seal the wrap. When using as a griddle, you can set each side to a specific temperature, but I really don't have any need for a griddle so didn't try this feature; maybe it gets hotter that way. I never used the griddle on my old Cuisinart either, I guess I'm just not a griddler.<br /><br />Drainage: As the other reviewers mentioned, the drainage is terrible. With several people reporting the same issue, I agree that it might be a design flaw. It really doesn't seem angled for the grease to drain properly, so the food sits in it while cooking. On ours, it particularly collects in the upper left corner - so much so that it was almost spilling over the outer edge (this also caused the food in that corner to not cook properly). The drain pan is another problem: it does not attach to the grill and just sits on the counter, so if you have to move the grill at all the drain pan doesn't move with it. Better remember to move it too or you'll be cleaning a greasy counter! Fortunately(?!?) the drainage is so bad that not much makes it into the pan anyway. It never feels securely attached, because it isn't.<br /><br />Basically, it doesn't fit in my kitchen, doesn't cook food the way I like it, and doesn't drain the grease. It's not seriously horrible, but for the price I would expect better temp control and much much better drainage. Not sure what else to say...it looks pretty, and the floating hinge works well (seriously, the hinge on the Cuisinart was always a bit sticky and the Frigidaire hinge is very smooth). I was really happy with my old grill and used it constantly; I'd hoped this fancy one would be even better but it just depresses me. I'd highly recommend the Cuisinart to anyone & everyone even though it's smaller. It's better to cook small amounts perfectly than large amounts insufficiently and drowning in grease.<br /><br />Oh, and Frigidaire's comment to a previous reviewer that the accumulating grease was due to them not patting their meat with a paper towel first is absolutely ridiculous. That wasn't even necessary on the world's first George Foreman countertop grill! These machines are built to drain fat away from your food, that's the whole point of them. And I don't care how many times you pat your bacon before putting it on this grill, you're still going to get bacon-grease soup."
1171,4,"The unit is a little large compared to the De Longhi unit I had that shot craps after 2 years of daily use.<br />Compared to the De Longhi the Cuisinart unit is easier to use and requires no 15 minute warm-ups.  The Stainless Steel finish and feel of the Cuisinart is nicer than the plastic finish on the DeLonghi.  The output on the new unit is faster but it took several run thru's to get rid of the \\""newness\\"" of the boiler and parts....The water reservoir is bigger and you can get more cups out of one full reservoir.  The cost was about $30 higher, but so far I'm very pleased and it as worth the extra.  I use Pilon yellow vacuum pack espresso grind coffee I get from AMazon and get a flavor that reminds me of Key West, FL.  Cuban style coffee and milk is a nice variation on the Cappuccino/Latte obsession many of us have."
1172,5,"These little magnets are just perfect for allowing you to magnetize your 40K figures. I used mine to magnetize my Blood Angels death company power packs and jump packs. The magnets are incredibly strong for their size,and produce an excellent stable grip for the pieces you are trying to connect."
1173,5,I love the whipping cream machine and the amazing service I got from the vendor.  The product was shipped immediately.  Why would anyone ever use canned whipping cream again?
1174,3,"These are unmarked.  I have no idea if they are Leland brand or not.  Since the listing says \\""By Leland\\"" I think they should be marked as such."
1175,1,"We followed directions exactly (preheated corn tortillas in microwave with damp paper towels), but all the tortillas remained almost flat and unfoldable and when we tried to put them on the racks they just slided off!!  We tried bending tortillas, but they only broke.  We tried spraying tortillas with butter spray, but that made it worse.<br /><br />I was going to buy a steamer, but seemed expensive just for tortillas.  Then I googled how to steam tortillas.  Easiest method THAT WORKS is to put slightly damp paper towel on plate, add stack tortillas then put another damp towel on top.  THEN put ANOTHER same size plate upside down over all.  Microwave 45 sec to 1 min and NICE SOFT TORTILLAS that DO LAY OVER the racks.  I haven't tried cooking them yet, but at least there is now a chance this may work."
1176,5,"LOVE this smoker. This is the second one I've bought--a gift for our son who loves to cook. We've used ours constantly since we got it last spring, mostly making salmon, but also with chicken, mushrooms (great with pasta) and other veggies. Well made, so easy to use and clean, and the results are fabulous.<br />The only caution I'd add is to adjust the timing of the recipes that come with the smoker. The meats are way overcooked for my taste. But easy to fix that. For small pieces of salmon I just keep the smoker on medium high heat for only about 4 minutes after smoke starts to escape. Then I take it off the burner (lid still closed) and let it finish in residual heat and smoke for 20-30 minutes. Check to see if it flakes. Moist, but just cooked. It is heaven. Of course chicken or larger pieces need a little more time.<br />A wonderful gently smokey smell fills you with anticipation while you wait.<br />Looking forward to trying pork ribs indoors this winter. Of course they'll need some extra slow-cook time in the oven, but the smoker is set up to do that too."
1177,2,"In 20 years, I have purchased at least 10 cookie sheets for my oven.  Never have I had to worry about the size of the sheet in relationship to my oven.  This cookie sheet, while lovely in appearance, is too large for my oven.  How dumb is that?  Be sure to measure your oven and check the size of this sheet.  I now have to give the whole thing away because I tossed the box, because it never occurred to me that I could be so stupid."
1178,4,"Purchased this after seeing a good review from Consumer Reports.  It works as promised, and the few controls are easy to figure out.  I just wish that the basket that holds the filter paper had little legs on it so it would stand upright on the countertop, instead of falling over to one side.  All in all, I'm satisfied.  Not ecstatic, but satisfied."
1179,5,"I am a voracious bread baker- from light and fluffy loaves to dense fruit-laden loaves. This knife cuts through everything with ease. It will even cut super-thin slices for appetizers and can be used to even-up bundt cakes, or other cakes, after cooling. I LOVE this knife."
1180,2,"My son loved his last Crocodile Creek lunchbox, and when it wore out he picked out this style to replace it. It wasn't until I got home that I realized that there is a big ol' misspelling on the side of the box: \\""Outter Space.\\"" Really, Crocodile Creek? (You can see it in the photo here on Amazon.) Hopefully they'll correct this on future manufacturing runs, but for now, I'm irritated that I spent so much money on something with so blatant an error."
1181,5,"WOW - after 15 years of service, my Zojirushi Rice Cooker finally called it quits. This is one of the best - and well used appliances I have EVER owned!  I am excited to see what the new technology brings to the table...hope it is as good as the first one!!"
1182,5,I was really pleased with my order for the patriotic items in August! they arrived on time and were beautiful for my sister's 60th wedding anniversary party!  Thank you!
1183,4,"Love this big and light weight wok.  We use it for stir fry, making pasta sauce, steam fish... the list goes on and on.  It doesn't splash oil or sauce everywhere because it is deeper than most woks. We use it to cook multiple meals daily.  One down side is that it is thinly non-stick coated so easily scratched. After 3-4 months using, it had a burn mark on the bottom of the wok, and scratched badly when I tried to wash the mark off with a muti-purpose scrub sponge. Lesson learned, do not scrub the wok too hard or the non-stick coating will come off.<br />I am buying the same wok again to replace it. It is still a great product for the price paid and the amount we use it."
1184,2,"These dont stand too well. I find them too fiddley to use to fill my bags, and they are hard to make stand to help dry my bags.<br /><br />I kinda wish i hadnt bothered buying them."
1185,1,"I was looking for a great, big mug to replace one that got stolen from my communal dorm bathroom, which I used extensively for making tea, soup, and oatmeal.  I read all the other reviews and figured since this was microwave and dishwasher safe, this would be a nice alternative.  Nope.  After trying to make tea in it for the first time (mugful of water in the microwave for 3 minutes, like I always do), the handle of the mug got insanely hot to the touch and I couldn't take it out soon enough to steep my tea.  I have no idea what the other reviewers were talking about when they specifically said this mug didn't get too hot to the touch.  None of my other mugs have done this, so I'm just going to have to assume it's a poor quality glaze or ceramic or something along those lines.  Perhaps the color (orange) I got is more prone to getting hot?  Shame, since it's darn cute and the perfect size for a bowl of oatmeal.  Still searching for a good soup mug to heat things up with in the microwave...<br /><br />EDIT:<br />8ish months later.  I see the sellers have changed the product description to say that this mug is only dishwasher safe, and not microwave safe.  This I can agree with.  Also, after countless microwave trips, handwashings and a few stints in the dishwasher, the very bottom interior of my mug is forming these odd hairline \\""cracked/crackly\\"" patterns, although they don't feel cracked to the touch.  I'm extremely worried that this thing is going to explode randomly one day (kind of like those warnings/\\""urban legends\\"" about the new Pyrex glass tupperware) when I microwave it or pour a hot liquid in it, so I may have to retire it as a tea/soup mug and use it only for cold beverages, which is not what I got it for in the first place, so I'm dropping this thing another star.  What's the point in a mug if it'll burn you for the first half year each time you try to microwave it, and then has the potential to explode for the rest of your life?<br /><br />As a final verdict, this thing was not worth anywhere near the 10 bucks spent on it.  If I wanted something this dangerous and disposable, I should've just bought a mug from a thrift/dollar store and replaced those every 6 months."
1186,5,This paring knife has a fine balance and a wonderfully graceful and comfortable handle.  A great tool and an even better value.
1187,2,"The tolerances on stock wooden sticks just aren't tight enough to expect an easy fit with every stick. Some slid in too easily and didn't stay put. Others couldn't be pushed in. Worse, some couldn't be removed after freezing without breaking the stick. They need a better system for holding the sticks or offer custom sticks. The pops looked nice though."
1188,3,"it take a little bit of effort to get it to work, rolling the right and wrong way. I still say its worth it for a good amount of garlic. much better than the smaller one!"
1189,5,I am using this in a unconventional manner. I am using it for Encaustic artwork. It is a good size for my small work area and keeps a low temp. Great unit.
1190,1,"I have been wanting to buy the nanoceramic cookware for some time and had this in my Amazon wishlist.<br />The other day I saw it on sale at Shoprite for $9.99. I was surprised and now I know why it was so cheap.<br />This pan lost it's non stickness after six to eight uses.<br />Plus as people are rightly pointing out on the internet, there is not much known about nanoceramic surfaces as it pertains to human health.<br />I would say, best is to use SS or cast iron pans with some oil and work off that fat."
1191,5,"This a very nice Pressure Canner. I like the fact that it is all metal with no rubber gaskets, i had to learn how to put the lid on right to get a good seal."
1192,5,"For the past 25 years we have been using nothing else but Corelle items, and after all these years they all as if they were very recently bought. The Stone Coaster is indeed very helpful as it protects your tables from getting wet due to the water drops gathering on an ice cold glass of water/Coke?juice, etc. It was again the right choice. I hope the color wont fade becuase whatever Corelle we have at home is made in the USA."
1193,1,"It wouldn't fit right with the cover, it was hard to remove the cover from it, and the white post (with the spring by the handle) wouldn't budge when the cover tried to push it down.  Had to return it; awaiting refund."
1194,5,This works great.<br /><br />It is easy to use.  You just push the metal and it will pop open like the baby hair clips.<br /><br />It will hold the large size bags.
1195,2,I read that West Bend was still produced in USA. This can opener is not. It is made in China. Very disappointed.
1196,2,"This lunch box was too small for my husband's lunch.  It was not worth sending back, so I gave it to one of my kids.  Great kids lunch box, but do not buy it if you have a lot to put in."
1197,5,I received excellent service!  My husband likes this pot.  He is going to use it for oyster stews and to cream corn.
1198,5,I have used this sausepan for several months and the non-stick surface has performed very well. The lid works great for long term simmering at low heat. Clean up is easy with mild soap and water or just a paper towel.
1199,1,"This toaster oven was purchased as a replacement for a cuisinart and I have been greatly disappointed in its baking capabilities. In spite of my best efforts, I have not been able to get the oven's temperature up to the required heat. I have my own oven thermometer which I use to check the temp; the oven display will say 400 degrees while my thermometer says 250 degrees after ten minutes of baking. Needless to say, rolls and cookies will not bake properly nor will chicken breasts (to say nothing of browning.) My advice--buy a toaster.<br /><br />Connie[[ASIN:B0039BJ3JG Hamilton Beach Set & Forget Toaster Oven with Convection Cooking]]"
1200,2,"These are really nice looking, but when they arrived 2 out of the 10 were already cracked in the bottom (around the \\""belly button\\"" where they came of the mold) and leaked so badly that they were not usable. Three others are cracked in the same area, but don't seem to leak (yet - I've only used them once).<br /><br />For the money they cost, I was very dissappointed."
1201,5,"I bought this for my cake making hobby, and for the school mascot we have.  Loved finding it cheaper than the original web site and can't wait to use it this week!"
1202,1,"Nice design, but definately not worth the price, $10. Looks like the price actually went up after I bought mine too! You don't even get to pick which one you get."
1203,3,"This decanter serves its purpose, but makes a mess along the way.<br /><br />I have two complaints regarding the replacement decanter.  First, when pouring coffee from the decanter, coffee tends to seep in between the glass and the black rim at the top of the decanter.  Naturally, the majority of the coffee pours out through the spout, but the equivalent of 2-3 tablespoons of coffee always finds its way into the area between the glass and the rim - resulting in coffee pouring onto the countertop.  Please note, this is a manufacturing issue - not a distributor issue.<br /><br />My second complaint is really just a nit.  I wanted to purchase a decanter with a white rim/handle - to match my white coffeemaker.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find a distributor who had the decanter with white trim.  That led me to check the Mr. Coffee Web site, and it too didn't have the decanter with white trim.  Naturally, I had to settle for a decanter with black trim.<br /><br />Just a brief note about the distributor - Promax Commerce.  I am thoroughly pleased with the rapid delivery of the decanter.  I actually received it 1 day earlier than the scheduled delivery date."
1204,5,"I love this water bottle. The color is unique and despite me having dropped it on concrete and it rolling, it kept its shape and only has very minor subtle scratches (the paint didn't come off). In particular, it's perfect for a yoga class, especially with its wide opening! I didn't think about that when I bought it but some of the metal water bottle canisters have smaller openings which make it harder to gulp the drink during the \\""sip\\"" before \\""crow pose.\\"" I don't know about you, but when I'm allowed that sip, I need to make the most of it. Kidding aside, I find it easier to drink from than my other water bottles, and I like the amount that it fits (perfect for cold water and one electrolyte packet). I like the small subtle message on the bottle as well."
1205,4,"This is the 2nd 6qt. Stir Crazy I have purchased/owned, having purchased the 2nd one based on the great performance of the 1st one purchased years ago. In between, we tried a hot air popper (The Warden wanted me to eat healthier. Pshaw! The junk that hot air popper turned out was only good for making \\""shipping\\"" popcorn.)From there we moved on to nuked popcorn.<br /><br />Last school year, I volunteered to be the \\""Popcorn Dude\\"" at my nephew's Christian Day school and make popcorn for the kids that wanted it each Friday. Someone had donated a used \\""Movie Theater\\"" style popcorn maker and the idea of using it appealed to me. Appealed that is until the person who had made popcorn in it the year before had the fire dept. show up twice because the smoke from the burnt popcorn set off the fire alarm. The thought of the FD showing up was pretty intimidating. It became apparent to me why is was donated in short order. I tried it twice and wasted 2 cups of unpopped corn for every cup it made, trying to prevent the alarm from going off. Enough of that!<br /><br />I came home and went straight to Amazon.com, having remembered how well the Stir Crazy had worked in the past and figuring they would have it. They did.<br /><br />I purchased one from Amazon.com and had it in short order. I have used it for the entire school year, making 4 to 8 batches every Friday except for the Holidays. I use Orville's Buttery Oil and popcorn exclsively. Other brands leave substantially more \\""old maids\\"". The real beauty of the Stir Crazy is the arm that continually keeps the kernels moving around so almost every one pops.<br /><br />It's Deja Vu all over again, well, almost. The Stir Crazy is now made in China instead of Wisconsin and the lid is now frail. Being careful with is is the order of the day. I'm ordering a replacement lid as the school year is over. But the unit made a huge pile of popcorn for the kids.<br /><br />Friendly Advice: If you put too much corn in it the lid comes up off the popper and starts spinning around. It's fun to watch, unless you're the one making the popcorn! When the Stir Crazy quits poppin' unplug it and using 2 pot holders turn it over and let is set for at least 30 seconds before removing the bottom. This will prevent any IED's from surprising you!"
1206,5,I really loved these salt and pepper  shakers. I was delighted to find they were even nicer than I expected. I love my sunflower kitchen and these made a great addition. Packaged well also. Prompt delivery. Just the right size not too big and not too small.
1207,5,I usually refrain from reviewing anything until I've had the product for a few months. Since I bought the 10 inch french knife a while back I already know the quality level of this company. I just took it for a test drive and deboned a rabbit. It was like cutting through butter. This knife also has a surprising level of flexibility for a damascus blade. Puts my old german steel boning knife to shame.
1208,5,"I purchased this product a few weeks ago while it was apparently on sale ($49).  The item shipped 4 days after I ordered it (a little longer than I was used to from Amazon).  However, it arrived in good shape.  I unpacked the ice cream maker and was pleased to find that all the parts were accounted for.  I successfully made a batch of caramel macchiato ice cream without a hitch.  It froze well, wasn't grainy, etc...  That may have had as much to do with the recipe as the machine itself, though.  Also, the recipe made around a quart, so it will be interesting to see how well the ice cream maker freezes and churns a gallon recipe.  But so far, so good!"
1209,5,"I received two of these that I ordered today and I LOVE THEM!  I find them to be very sturdy and they hold just about all of my spices with the exception of those in the square cans (like black pepper).  The brand spices I have in there and that fit (full size) are McCormick, 5th Season, Mrs. Dash spices and a few other \\""off\\"" brands.  Even my Tastefully Simple spices fit.  I have two or three spices that are in more of a squarish, clear jar and tipped on their side some, they fit just fine too.  Great product in my opinion."
1210,5,"This is a good, heavy pan that is very adaptable for many types of cooking.  I love the shape because I can make breads with saut&eacute;ed ingredients in one pan and because of the square shape, it is easily served.  It is also great for steak that is started on the stovetop and finished in the oven.  I appreciated not having to season the pan before the first use."
1211,5,"I love when a simple kitchen kitchen gadget makes life much easier.  Not only is this great at scraping dough off the counter and cutting it, it also helps transfer ingredients from the cutting board to the pot.  Think beyond the box...not just a dough blade and I love it."
1212,2,"This unit may have just been a defective one, so my review may not reflect this model line accurately. The juicer I received was very beautiful and solidly built. I slowly and thoughtfully assembled it according to the directions and everything fit together exactly how it is suppose to. The disappointment came when I inserted my first produce: part of a head of celery. I just set it in there gently, after turning the machine on, and let it go at its own pace while keeping very minor pressure on the produce. Juice started pouring into the glass and also started dripping into the pulp collector and dripping out the sides of the unit. Only dry pulp is suppose to go into the collector and no juice should drip out the sides of the unit. The pulp that did go into the collector was very soggy, too wet to have been juiced properly. We have a $50 GE juicer that does a much better job which is strange because before that we had an older Jack Lalanne Juicer that worked better than the GE! So, I don't know what's going on, but I sent the juicer back today with no problem at all from Amazon: They paid to ship it back. Amazon is awesome."
1213,5,"Great value, fast shipping and same as seller explained. I broke my brender and I though I have to throw this machine away, because I saw a pices of plastic came off from the machine. I found out, that broken part is drive socket. So I looked for this part. After I compared price, this seller offer the best deal."
1214,5,"Great hog rings for doing upholstery work.  They grip and bend well, don't rust and the price is right."
1215,5,Love Love Love these copper mugs! Moscow Mules don't taste right unless you have them in this shiny little copper mug.<br />I would recommend them to anyone. They will last forever as well.
1216,1,"After about a week of using the mug, during which that time it worked fine for my needs, I dropped it on a concrete floor and ever since then it has been leaking from the bottom. It seems that it may just be the condensation (I was using it primarily for water) that accumulates between the two layers leaking from the joint on the bottom.  I regret being clumsy enough to drop it in the first place, but I also expect products such as this to be a little more durable than becoming useless after a four foot fall."
1217,2,"I've had this tea tumbler for about two years. When it arrived, the mesh screen had a very slight tear in it, but it was not big enough to complain about. Over several weeks of use, the tear kept getting bigger and bigger, and now if I use it, I'm afraid pieces of metal wire will break off into my tea. Also, the metallic lid is glued to a plastic top. The heat from the tea caused the glue to melt and now the metal cover has come off, exposing the ugly, glue-flaked plastic top."
1218,3,I got these for our fun colorful wedding.. i loved the pattern.. but they are made out of lightweight plastic.. not what i was wanting... fun for a picnic tho. I returned mine and got a full refund.
1219,4,"I have been through so many coffee travel mugs its not funny. They always seem to have some design weakness that annoys me. After 2 weeks of use, so far this is the best mug I have used. Warm liquids last a long time ~3 hours. It is very solidly build. Keeps liquids from spilling when in the closed position.  Fits in my car cup holders. The lid takes some dis-assembly to clean but it is easy to do. Hopefully this mug lasts a long time because it is rather expensive which is the only reason I am giving it 4 stars rather than 5."
1220,4,Keeps my wine still fresh after a day of it being opened. I've tried other sealers before and this one works the best.
1221,5,"I got one of these to transport and store a cupcake in my son's school freezer in case he needs a allergy safe treat to eat with his classmates.  My homemade cupcakes fit fine, but are squeezed just a bit by the prongs, but that keeps them from flipping.  They keep well and hold them so the frosting stays as intact as possible.  I'm going to get a few more to have on hand for lunches of other functions.  They stay closed, but are easy enough for him to open."
1222,5,I purchased these crystal toasting flutes for our daughter's wedding. We both loved them! They more than met our expectations. Beautiful!
1223,5,"It only took two and a half weeks to actually convince Todd to screw this puppy into the wall, but once it was there, it was worth the skin and blood he scraped off his hands to mount it.  I'm happy."
1224,5,"After using top-of-the-line blenders from Cuisinart and Kitchen Aid for years I decided to test this Ninja blender after my Kitchen Aid blender died on me. I am pretty happy with it so far. It has a powerful motor and blends all foods perfectly. I blend anything from pancake batter to smoothies and it performs 100% at all times. The acrylic jar is not as resistant to scratches as the glass jar on the other brands, but this is cosmetic and I rather stick to performance over looks."
1225,5,Fills quickly which is a big plus when you need instant water to make Lemonade or Iced tea. I do wish the pour opening was a little slimmer but other than that. Im satisfied. Water taste great no problems here.
1226,5,"As a first time spaetzle maker, this was so easy to use!  It comes with a recipe, which turned out well.  I would recommend this product to anyone."
1227,4,"This is a great little pan, the size is really useful to have around. Our other pans for broiling tend to be larger and sometimes that is just a waste. For a couple of burgers or chicken breasts this is just so much easier to deal with. It performs its job very well, BUT it doesn't hold up to long term ownership..  As many other reviews have noted, somewhere in the 10-14 month range the bottom will start rusting and flaking if you dish wash it. I have looked around and for the $13 price range have not found anything of similar size that seemed to have better durability. I am not going to knock the item for this because I knew it going in since this was not our first. Since we use this 2-4 times a week, I am not going to complain when I have to spend $13 a year to replace it, I feel like I get my money's worth..."
1228,5,This K-cup storage is stylish & space saving. K-cups are easy to retrieve and select. Drawers slide out to completely allow you to select cups. This holds 3 18ct k-cup boxes.
1229,5,"Just received the West Bend can opener from Amazon today...Really like it so far, I see no cons for this product UNLESS it doesn't last long!!!  Opens cans quickly and holds the lids perfectly!!!  Should also be easy to clean!!!"
1230,4,"These cannisters seem to seal well.  They are fairly light weight.  As noted by others, the \\""window\\"" is a fairly thin plastic and I wouldn't want to push hard on it.  The top is curved, but I still stack the smallest one on the largest one and I have no problems with the top one sliding off.  For the price, they are ok, but I would love to find some really nice, stainless steel canisters with flat tops.  The windows are nice to see what is in the cannisters - definitely a feature I would not have looked for but enjoy having."
1231,5,"I absolutely love this little sauce pan!  Over the years I have 'gone through' several of these size pans with varying degrees of satisfaction, but this pan is my favorite so far.  It is so easy to hold and cleans up beautifully--haven't had any problem with food burning or sticking, either.  I definitely would recommend this sauce pan."
1232,5,I've had a coffee pot like this for 15 yrs and love it.  I get up for work long before my husband.does and this allows me to make a large cup of coffee without wasting a whole pot..  It's quick and easy to use and easy to clean.  I took one to work for that late afternoon cup of coffee when you don't want to make a whole pot.  Try it you'll love it!!!
1233,5,"We researched, shopped, experimented. For beauty, quiet, cleanliness, access, design, and coffee quality we have a winner in this machine."
1234,1,"Before buying this blender, I read some of the other reviews about it being difficult to clean. I didn't really understand the problem but now I do. It really is a hassle to remove the jug from the base and remove the rubber seal from around the blades, only to find a load of gunk. Surely there have to be other blenders that are easier to clean?  I've also been using my blender to make green smoothies - without ice - and it's really hard to get this blender going, it doesn't seem very powerful. In addition, the smoothie won't pour out of the tap easily if it's thick. Then you have the hassle of cleaning out the tap.  I'm looking to buy a different blender, and it seems with blenders it might be a case of, \\""you get what you pay for\\"". I feel I wasted my money on this item."
1235,4,"When you want to heat or cook something small and don't want to waste energy heating up your regular oven, a toaster is a good alternative. Toaster ovens all heat up and cook food- where they differ is in their features, intuitive operation, and other factors. And compared to others, the Cuisinart TOB- 60 Convection Toaster Oven is a very good oven for general cooking needs.<br /><br />Looking at the physical aspects, this oven offers a nice, medium size and its brushed stainless steel exterior gives it a modern look. A digital readout would make it even more appealing to the eyes, but it still looks good on any countertop- particularly if you have a kitchen full of stainless steel appliances.<br /><br />Performance- wise, this Cuisinart appliance gets the job done. It prepares pizzas, frozen meals, and small food dishes nicely and in the expected time. I often use it in conjunction with the microwave. The microwave is good at heating things quickly while this oven is good when you want to add a little browning to your food. Whether used separately or with the microwave, I find the cooking more than acceptable.<br /><br />Cuisinart manufactured this oven a little more simply than others. There are only three knobs and when some people first used it, they could find themselves over- complicating matters as they fiddle with the settings. Look at the instructions first and you will learn that this is actually a very easy to use small appliance. I think we are all so used to having more features and more ways of doing things that when something simple is presented, it seems complicated. But this is actually a very simple appliance and anyone can learn how to use it.<br /><br />Cuisinart manufactures many quality products and I find the Cuisinart TOB- 60 Convection Toaster Oven a very good small appliance. It cooks food well and in reasonable time, looks nice on the countertop, and is simple to use.  Add to that the low price and you have a good toaster oven for the money.y."
1236,1,"UPDATE  MAY 27, 2012: I'm back with an update. After about 50 trouble-free uses the thermometer would not turn on. I removed the battery - voltage was OK - and re-inserted it a couple of times and then the thermometer came on. BUT, now I couldn't turn it off. I pushed the reset button and the thermometer reset itself. Still, it would not turn off. I compared the feel of pushing the on-off switch with the feel of my wife's working thermometer and mine had no \\""click\\"" feel to it as her's did. I'm guessing that the on/off switch died. The instruction tag says \\""Battery life up to 1 year of continuous use. Use \\""Off\\"" switch to extend battery life\\"". This has now turned into a \\""battery life test\\"" unless I want to remove and then re-install the battery whenever I want to use it - which I definitely will not be doing.  I now agree with the other reviewer that got only 5 uses before his broke. - I do not recommend this thermometer now and it gets one star.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW JAN 7, 2012: I bought the same 9836 thermometer at a local store as a Christmas stocking-stuffer for my wife. I have tested it with boiling water and ice water and found it to be very accurate.  The pivoting head and \\""Hold\\"" button make it easy and fast to insert the thermometer into meat as soon as you pull out the oven rack without having to put your face near the hot open oven to immediately read the temperature.<br /><br />I see a photo of a melted thermometer included by another reviewer. It looks like it was put inside a hot oven and cooked.  The instructions included with my thermometer state:<br /><br />\\""Do not leave thermometer in heated oven\\""<br /><br />I do not know the type of plastic the body of the thermometer is made of, however, plastics generally melt in the range of 250 to 400 degrees F.<br /><br />As an aside for the guys, since the measurement range goes up to 450 deg F., I used it to check the flue temperature of my oil fired boiler. Worked great - 388 deg. F. Yes, I put only thestem of the thermometer into the flue pipe. Needless to say, I didn't tell my wife - I cleaned up the stainless steel stem and put it back in the kitchen.  Hope she doesn't find out!! I think I better buy another one for myself to use on my projects."
1237,1,Only the lid?? What a bummer. Now trying to find out how to order the bottle. I'm sure I will now have two lids...
1238,2,"This looks great - nice red color, but I am disappointed in its performance. My old Braun coffee grinder took 33 secs to grind coffee to espresso style fine powder.  This new machine took 1 min 30 secs to grind, which is 3 times as long.  The blades look dull, even brand new.  The motor is fine, probably as strong as the Braun, but the blades did not do the job.  I still find the Braun grinder superior to every other version. Note: do not buy Braun if its made in Mexico, as these versions 'leak' coffee dust into the motor - the seals are a problem.  I wrote repeatedly to Braun, but to no effect.  Use the Braun models made in Spain - absolutely the best!  Stay away from Cuisinart, they need to improve the product."
1239,5,"Clean, classic, beautiful, and strong. I'm really pleased with this set and I'm sure it's going to last for years."
1240,4,"The Baster is useful for drawing up excess fluid from my coffee maker, which otherwise would need to have been turned upside down for the job. What a pain that was! The brush is rarely needed, but is a good idea, just in case the baster gets plugged up."
1241,5,"I love this product!  It is simple to make delicious coffee, almost anywhere.  I bought one for all my friends!"
1242,5,"These are beautiful and each piece feels good in your hand...good heavy weight and perfectly balanced...They are beautiful but you won't feel guilty about using them everyday...no intricate, flowery or gaudy designs just simple elegance.  Each piece has the maker's symbol of quality, something you'd expect in quality craftmanship, but unlike other company's flatware, it's stamped on the front of each piece."
1243,5,"Does what it's made for: fills your flask. The funnel straw may be too large for some flasks, so check before you buy. I measured mine to about 3/8\\"" (outer diameter). Looks like a well made funnel."
1244,4,This is a pretty nice grinder.  The best one I've had.  It'll grind up anything your throw at it.  It's made out of nice material and has good build quality.  The only thing that annoys me is the fact that the herb will get in the threaded part and it's hard to get out without some kind of brush.  Just don't expect to be able to dumb the herb in a hurry and have it somewhat clean.  It's going to be obvious unless you plan ahead.  Also didn't come with the pollen scraper hence the 4 stars.  There are better grinders for the price but they're smaller so this is still a great buy.
1245,5,"my 3yrs love kung fu panda look every item of this carton and he saw the plates in stores for $3 only the big plate,then i grab my phone and search for this here and saw the 3pc for $5.99 and buy it it really good price for this set the plastic is hard but the cup plastic is little soft perfect size for his little hands....and he LOVE IT!!!!"
1246,5,"This is my first time to buy a Thermos mug. It looks very good, both the shape and the color are true to the pics on amazon. Just a little bit expensive."
1247,1,"I purchased this for my daughter for school.  She has used it for almost 2 months and it is already falling apart.  The metal plate on the front is held on with little black pegs and they are all almost broke.  I found all of these little black things in it when she brought it home one day and finally figured out that they were the broken pegs.  I agree with the previous reviewer that the inside should not be made of fabric.  My daughter left a partially full yogurt container in it and it got all over the inside.  There is no way to clean it...ugh. After just 2 months, I am replacing it.  Too bad, it is really cute!"
1248,5,"Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend.  He loves it!  Its the perfect 1 cup coffee maker because there are no filters and the stainless steel cup is great for travel.  I highly recommend this, especially for the price.  It's worth at least twice as much."
1249,4,"Rack did not fit into space in which I wanted to use it. Had to disassemble and reassemble part of it and was very easy to do so. Fits perfectly now, attractive appearance."
1250,5,The item has been what we needed.  My family is well pleased and take very little space.  Has features our other oven didn't have yet it is more compact.  It is very easy to clean.
1251,4,"the build quality of the product is actually way better than i expected. clean design, no rough edges. there's a little clip that locks the flask into place so it doesn't flop around.<br /><br />the size isn't too bad either, isn't too huge around your waist, and it holds a double shot worth of your favorite spirit.<br /><br />only small complaint is that the arm that holds on the lid rattles around a bit, can easily modify it with some putty or something to hold it in place though.<br /><br />fun item, definitely recommend!"
1252,5,This scale is perfect for everyday use in kitchen or shop.  Big quick numbering.  Easy to set up and use.  We keep it in box in kitchen cabinet for quick use.
1253,5,I love this reusable filter since it allows me to buy the specialty coffees that I love and still make them in my Keuring machine.  This is great being the only coffee drinker in the house and also proudces less waste.
1254,3,"You can't beat this for the price. I got it to replace my Mercer 9\\"" Chef, which is a very serious blade, just not my cup of tea. I really prefer the Santoku knife, and love my Mercer Genesis knife kit which this matches. As a culinary student, I can say with certainty that I would not have passed my knife skills practical exam without this baby. Its my go-to axe until further notice, or until I can afford a Global or a Shun.<br />An update to this is that after 8 weeks of light to moderate use in culinary college, the blade is pitted badly, from some unknown metal to metal contact. This shouldn't happen to a brand new knife which has not been abused, and has always been washed by itself. I will attempt to return to Mercer and see what happens."
1255,5,"I love this cookware.  Can I say that again?  I spend a lot of time in the kitchen cooking for family and friends, and I am just so pleased with this set.  I have owned these pans over a year now, and can't say one bad thing about them.  I wanted to invest in a stainless steel cookware set, and I wanted one that would last, and wouldn't be cheap and flimsy, like so many sets I had seen.  And  All-Clad just wasn't even a thought for me, because of the sticker shock.  I mean, come on, for the price of one All-Clad pan, I bought this entire set!  It's a no-brainer.  I am the type that does lots of research and reads lots of reviews before I buy any new product, and this set was my choice, hands down. Nothing else even came close to the quality, price, and good manufacturer reputation that I found in this product.  I previously owned a set of nonstick Circulon pans which I loved, but the coating was starting to peel off in my food, yuck!  I was hesitant about stainless because so many people said it is hard to clean, compared with nonstick coated pans.  Well, these pans are a CINCH to clean up.  I just soak the pan while I cleaning the rest of my dishes, and then go back and clean the pan when I am done, and the food comes right off.  I also have found that Barkeeper's Friend is the best product on the market for cleaning stainless pans.  I use it almost every time I wash my pans, if there is any greasy or caked on residue that doesn't come off with normal washing.  Just sprinkle some onto the bottom of a mostly dry pan, and either using your fingers or a sponge, clean the residue off.  It really is a miracle product.  My pans still look shiny and brand new since I maintain them that way.  Sometimes it takes a bit of elbow grease if you have an oil type build up (like from frying), but trust me, it comes perfectly clean!    All in all, I would not hesitate to recommend these pans 100%.  They are one of the best kitchen investments I have ever made.  Sturdy, professional, beautiful, and precision cooking.  Cuisinart has the best stainless steel pans in the market, and you can't beat the price."
1256,5,"I had formerly used a Brita bottle and it was nice. However, my husband didn't like the bicycle top on it for drinking. The Rubbermaid bottle has a more open top and you do have to give a light squeeze for the water to come through, but it's very easy to do. I don't have strong hands, but I have no problem using this bottle. The filter is different from the charcoal filters I have been used to, and I think I like it better. No charcoal dust in the bottom of the bottle, absolutely delicious taste to the water. I like the fact that the protective cap is attached to the bottle so that it doesn't get lost. My only negative comment at this point is that the bottle is a little top-heavy when empty, so I have to make sure I place it back a little on the shelf when I am storing it so that it doesn't fall off the shelf if jarred slightly. This is a very minor issue. I would highly recommend this bottle and filter to anyone who wants to enjoy good-tasting water from a light but sturdy carry bottle."
1257,5,"This nutbag is so amazing!! I have been making rice milk, millet milk, nut milk, etc. for years and it has always been such a pain trying to strain it. This is so easiest thing in the world and it is simple to clean too! I got it a couple days after I ordered it so the service was very fast and excellent! The bag is also good for straining small grains and sprouting."
1258,1,"I recently bought this cooker and after reading another review which highlighted the fact that the outside of it gets too hot, I simply shrugged it off, and bought it at Walmart anyway.  I'm trying it now and the outer metal will ABSOLUTELY BURN YOUR FLESH within seconds after it has been on for an hour.  It is shoddy workmanship that subjects the user to potential harm if not careful.  If a child were to come in contact with it we're talking first of second degree burns within moments.  How can such a dangerous product be allowed to be sold in America?  Take this brand off the shelves and never buy it.  I'm appalled at the heat rising from the outside of it and I'm curious if there have been any lawsuits from this piece of junk.  Do yourself a favor and avoid \\""Crock Pot: the original slow cooker\\"" brand and spend a couple more dollars for something that slow cooks your food, not fast cooks your flesh."
1259,4,"The calendar basket that you put the lettuc in could be a bit bigger, but other than that, it works great, and does the trick!"
1260,5,Works just as descried. No leaking and takes the occasional drop from a toddler just fine. Put it in the dishwasher a couple of times and no loss to color either.
1261,5,"As usuual the amazon purchase was as expected. The set is not only long lasting but also well priced. The pattern is attractive and the pieces are functional..Dishwasher safe, the overall product grade is a five star... great value...great price as usual with the big A"
1262,5,"Easy, fast, the bowl was reusable in less than 4 hours, can use a variety of milks, yogurts, soy. About the size of a food processor, easy to clean. $15-20 more in various stores. Highly recommend"
1263,4,"I first bought a George Forman Grill.  It worked alright in the beginning, but after several uses, the button you needed to push in got stuck and I had to use a knife to push it on.  Then, it became extremely hard to clean.  I ended up spraying Greased Lightning on it to clean it but it still took a long time.  It did not have a timer and went for 5 minutes, so I had to keep pushing the button (with the knife) to start it up again.  Needless to say, I got rid of it.  I waited a long time and did a lot of research before I bought another grill.  I settled on the Cuisinart Griddler.  I've only used it a few times, but it did a good job and the grills are removable and I did what they recommended as to letting it cool down before trying to clean it and when it did, I soaked it overnight in some soapy water.  The next morning, I just went over them with a wash rag and it cleaned right up.  So, so far, I like it but need to experiment with it more.  It has a dial but I don't know how long is cooks when I turn it on, so I need more time to practice.  I would recommend it over George Foreman though.  Happy grilling!"
1264,5,"I purchased 2 of these ice tea pots intending to give one as a gift.  I like it so well, I'm keeping both.  While the size is small, I now can make different flavors of tea overnight in the refrigerator.  I will still use my Mr. Coffee tea maker but these pots are less hassle if you plan ahead.  I'm very happy with the tea pots and find clear glass is more appealing than plastic any day.  Thanks go to the Japanese for another good idea."
1265,1,"this garlic press is super ugly.  I guess I should have known', but it looks OK in photos.  Second, the rubber \\""cleaner\\"" fell off immediately and it's not next to impossible to clean it.  I tried to contact the seller, but he said it was manufacturing error. After all, I didn't feel like wasting my time returning it and not it's a huge pain in the neck to clean. Does the job of crushing garlic, though.."
1266,5,"I bought this for my grandma for her birthday because she had a lousy plastic scoop. The ice cream slides right off it, and it's made of durable metal.<br /><br />If you don't mind spending extra money though I would buy a Zeroll brand ice cream scoop. I have one and it lets me scoop ice cream right out of the freezer because it uses your body heat to melt through the ice cream even if it's solid."
1267,1,"I wasn't going to review this item, but this is the second email I have been sent to review it.  I used this product one time, it broke and it is now in the garbage.  It didn't work, just made a mess.  If I want to make Spaetzle I will need to get a real maker, like my mother in law."
1268,5,I love a glass teapot where the infuser is glass and you can see that it's clean and clear.   It is a very elegant looking piece.  Excellent customer service.
1269,5,bought this because we make a lot of hard boiled eggs and i was getting tired of messing them up......some would be green and some would be a bit squishy inside.......with this egg timer all you do is place your eggs in the pot and put the egg timer in there right along with the eggs and cook.......the timer will change colors and when the color changes to the softness of the egg you want time to take the eggs out.........its that simple..........we use it EVERY time we hard boil eggs now!!!!
1270,5,"Compact , great heat control and easy to assemble. Fits perfect on our condo patio. Food tasted great and cleanup was a breeze !"
1271,5,"I also replaced my Oster glass jar I broke sometime ago and saw this one available and decided to purchase it also. This Oster blender (\\""Beehive/Retro Style) is by far the best blender I have owned (including high end) due to the metal part that connects to the motor which turns the blades. It is also the highest wattage of all inexpensive blenders, quite powerful, works great. I never attempted to buy any other blender so delighted to have this one back in business."
1272,5,"So, it kind of looks phallic, but it's also very well made and pretty stylish. It is definitely one of the best looking shakers I've used, it's high-quality and works well."
1273,5,This is the best knife I have every had.   I received one as a gift from a friend many years ago.    I had her buy me another one.    I use them for everything from slicing veggies to cutting meat and bread.    I had the sleeves to keep them in because they are so sharp and deceided to check on line to see if I could purchase more.    I have given them to my sister and daughters-in-law.   They are so pleased with them.  They are the best.
1274,5,"These are the best funnels for their price to use for hot candy making! I used them for the first time with molten hot lolly pop mixture which I needed to get exactly into tiny jewel molds. These worked wonderfully! I did not burn my hands like I normally do. Plus I could work much faster which helps a lot when dealing with hot candy! The three different sizes are great to choose from when you need something very small, medium small, or medium! The only complaint I might have is that the handles are not very thick, but they should not bend unless you are really careless with them. They were packaged wonderfully, arrived safe & sound, plus they were here ahead of their expected arrival date! Great company, and a great product!"
1275,5,"I have had my Copco 2qt carafe for 13 years, and use it every night. I make tea to have next morning before we get up. I put the boiling water and tea bags in around 9-10pm, and have very hot tea at 6-7am. I have had to replace the lid once, and their service was very prompt. This has been an excellent product, and I certainly recommend it. I had three before that wouldn't hold the heat overnight. I do think it's been one of the best buys I ever made considering I use it every day."
1276,4,"I am a big fan of Anne Taintor and all things vintage western so I had to have this bag.  It is an adorable bag, it folds up nicely for storage, and it has a large capacity.  However, the cardboard that came for the bottom support is as flimsy as the cardboard on a cereal box.  I ended up replacing it with a sturdy piece of cardboard.    If you love Anne Taintor and vintage western art, then this is probably worth the $12.99 price tag.  If you are looking for a large tote, you can probably get a more durable item cheaper."
1277,5,"I use it every day- I can carry my Starbucks, water, Dr. Pepper without drawing attention to the fact that it takes a lot of caffeine and hydration to get me through the day. Cute and easy to carry over the shoulder, great quality and the plastic lining on the bottom is easy to clean up in case of spills... Love Love Love it!"
1278,4,"Really happy to find this strainer with a nylon mesh instead  of metal as they do not rust ... The one down side is that if  you're straining a lot of hot food items, the mesh will warp a  bit.      However, given the price I can't complain as the one this is   replacing is about 5 years old."
1279,1,"Wish I had seen the other reviews that mentioned this teapot is defective...the metal piece on the spout is not attached at all, and I've returned this item.   Stay away!"
1280,3,"I used this once for a party and got compliments on the coffee.  So I guess it's good.  It takes a long time to brew (maybe 45 minutes for a full pot).  That means that if you run out in the middle of a party, there will be no more coffee for a while.  But I suppose that is true for all of these.    So I would have given this 4 or 5 stars but the listing is deceptive: It doesn't make 42 cups.  It makes 42 \\""five-ounce cups.\\""   A cup is not five ounces; it is eight.   It's not debatable; it's definitional. At the very minimum, West Bend or Amazon should have disclosed the fact that it is 42 small servings.   Basically, the manufacturer lied about the capacity; it actually is around 26 true cups.  Maybe they all do it (I have not researched that), but regardless, it is deceptive and wrong."
1281,5,"Look even better when you receive them, wood is lovely.  Shorter than I expected but really just what I needed to replace old chipped salad servers."
1282,5,"Honestly, I'd read all the reviews and actually tried entering a few blogs' contests to see if I could win one.  Of course, I did not win one....  However, I searched the company's website and saw they donated to charity and 'lo and behold they were supporting breast cancer research--a cause very near and dear to my heart as well as other body parts afflicted  by this stupid disease. I sent the company a quick email just letting them know I appreciated the fact that they used their some of their proceeds to support charities.  I actually got a very personal email back from the \\""big guy\\"" at EatSmart. I was impressed.  Impressed enough to buy this scale.  I admit that when it arrived I was skeptical.  It's smaller than it looks (which I was glad about), and it's pretty lightweight.  Don't let that fool you.  For $25 bucks you get way more than your money.  It's awesome.  I love it. I seriously have thought about buying this for gifts for fellow friends, bloggers, family, etc. My hubs and I process our own game and this will definitely come in handy this fall.  Also, I'm weighing my yarn on it, so if you spin your own yarn, you should definitely consider this scale to weigh (in grams!) your yarn.<br />Great product--awesome company! I bet they're even awesome to work for![[ASIN:B001N07KUE EatSmart Precision Pro Digital Kitchen Scale, Silver]]"
1283,5,"Very easy to use. I like the fact that I have the choice of grams, kilograms, ounces, or pounds. I would order this item again."
1284,1,"You would think the diameter would be wider (it is) but the mesh the same density as smaller tea strainers (it's not). Lots of dust and tea particles come out in your sink (which is where you have to start) and then in your tea, no matter how much you try to shake in the sink in advance. Waste of money. Don't do it."
1285,5,"I have owned this item for almost 4 months.  Prior to the purchase of this item, I had 3-cup sylvania rice cooker. I hated the product because the water always overflows when it's about to finish cooking, and getting rid of the rice at the bottom of the lid after use was a pain. I felt like I was wasting rice.   So, I decided to buy something better.  Like the most reviewed customer said, I was debating between the 3-cup rice cooker.  I live alone and thought this product would be too big for me.  But having used this rice cooker for 4 months, it hasn't caused any problem for me.  I usually cook 3-zojirushi cup rice, and I put the leftover into freezer. Although I love the taste of it when it's freshly cooked, microwaved rice is still good.  I have only tried cooking white rice and mixed rice. Would like to try the baking feature soon.    Pros:  - Timer (can be timed to be cooked for next morning, after work, etc.)  - Easy to wash (the inner lid is VERY easy to clean. Does not stick at the bottom)  - Bumpy spatula (rice does not stick.)  - Warming (regular & extended warm - keeps the rice warm and fresh)    Cons:  - The inner lid moves around when getting the rice out   - Takes little long to cook (Regular-40min, Quick-25min) although I don't mind it because I usually use timer for next day or for later use  - If rice is in warming mode for too long, it gets hard at the bottom.    If you are considering to buy a nicer rice cooker, but not so much into buying IH (induction heating) rice cooker, this one is the way to go. You won't regret it."
1286,1,"I tried this thing on my best knife, it ate chunks out of the blade in the first two strokes, and i started with gentle pressure not pushing at all. This thing is a piece of destruction. I should probably go buy a sharpening stone, i am not sure if any other of these easy sharpeners are better."
1287,5,"Ok, I come from the land of cast iron.  Not that long ago I bought a large stainless steal pan.  Great pan, love it, and used it all the time until...  These things knock the pants off of either one in my opinion.  They heat evenly and clean easily.  The only downside is I'm going to look like Popeye if I keep trying to toss things with this pan."
1288,5,"This little rice maker is our favorite new appliance.  Bought on ebay for a bargain price, which perhaps is the only way I could justify the cost.  In a two person, two dog household, the three cup size is perfect.  Three cups makes plenty of rice for us.  :)  I usually make 2 to 2 1/2 cups.  This rice maker also makes wonderful mixed rices, such as Lundberg's wild rice blend or boxed pilaf mixes.<br /><br />Update April 2014<br /><br />Well, officially, me and the rice maker have been feeding my little family for three years and it is going strong!  I love it.  Lately, I have been making quinoa in it too.  Whether I make it plain with water, or in a broth, it comes out light and fluffy and I never have to worry about it burning on the stove.<br /><br />Perfect way to get dinner started while napping!  :D<br /><br />Enjoy!"
1289,5,"I like this spinner very much.  It's easy to pump.  It doesn't slide all over the counter.  There's a little button to stop the spinning.  My salad gets nice and dry, and then I can use bowl to serve it in.  Cleanup is easy.  I couldn't ask for anything more."
1290,3,"Just received my new Breville BOV800XL. Was using a very old DeLonghi toaster oven with no convection. Today I used the Breville to cook frozen pork strips. They cooked pretty good especially with the convection and the frozen food option. Had one thick piece a little red and had to cook it longer. Strips cooked faster than my old Delonghi would have for sure. I like the clever auto eject using a magnet in the middle rack position. The grill tray had a small chip of the paint in a corner, I am now working with Breville to get it replaced. Sure seems like for this price the grill and drip pans should be stainless steel rather than coated plain steel. My Delonghi had the same coated steel drip pan and it rusted over time. Another reason for stainless is that Breville has a warning with the unit saying not to use the dishwasher to washer these pans :-(. Sure wish I knew this before I bought this. Last gripe, the LCD display is not designed quite right. When the oven is on the counter and you are standing in front of it, the display is not that clear. It is ONLY very clear when you bend down and look at the display straight on, DUMB. I'll try to update this review in a month or two."
1291,5,Think this is a perfect little waffle iron! Very good value for money. The browning settings work very well and I love that it tells you when your waffle is ready.
1292,5,"This is a lovely cake pedestal. Different, uncommon. The simple glass top and shiny silver palm trees evoke a modern feel, which I don't ordinarily lean toward, but at the same time there is a timeless elegance which is very appealing. The seller shipped quickly and the pedestal was well packaged."
1293,5,I've been using these for about a month and I love them.  I'm totally a non cooker and if I can use them anyone can.  There may be a spot weld problem with some of the handles but I haven't had that problem. As for the complaints about the eggs sticking.  That's why they invented Pam.  I use Pam on everything including teflon coated pans. I haven't had any discoloration or pealing of paint. I do wash them by hand. And the complaint about the handles getting hot. Give me a break.
1294,5,I bought this as a Christmas present for my husband. We had the single waffle maker and kept having to replace it do to a short. I upgraded to the double so that now we both can have hot waffles at the same time. It's an added bonus and I would recommend paying more for this model vs the other one that you could get at Sams Club for about $20 less.<br /><br />We have used it several times and once you get used to the settings and amount of mix you need your waffles will be perfect every time!!
1295,5,I purchased this item for my husband because when we have parties we have to purchase bags of ice  and then somehow still need more for drinks.  This ice maker does make the ice quick enough to keep  it going for parties.  If you need to fill an ice chest you need to plan ahead to make enough.  So  far we are happy with the product.
1296,5,"I saw a set of these glasses at a local department store, fell in love w/ them but the selection of glass styles and the price kept me from ordering them.  I wanted a heavier nice glass similar to Waterford and knew that they would be out of my price range.   While on line comparison shopping, came across selection at Amazon, compared and ordered.  They promptly arrived in excellent condition and I have been using them as everyday glasses.  They are beautiful, durable and machine washable!  Highly rec."
1297,4,The groove on the inside is annoying to clean.  Got it during the 4 for 3 so it was a really good deal.  It's hard to use for an extended period of time as it will always want to stay open so your hand will get tired trying to grip things.
1298,5,This is a great addition to the mixer.  It really does a good job scraping the sides of the bowl.
1299,1,"I bought this grinder because I wanted to start burr grinding my own coffee, as opposed to shredding the beans.  I was told that burr grinding gives a better cup of coffee. This grinder worked great for about a month, but then the timer broke and it would only grind for 10 to 15 seconds before stoping.  I was constantly having to turn it back on to get enough coffee ground just for one cup.  I sent it in and customer service was very good.  They paid for shipping and sent me an email right away saying that the timer was indeed broken and they were sending me another.  About a month later, a new one showed up on my door step.  The next morning, however, it didn't work.  I fooled and fooled with it and went through all the troubleshooting tips.  Eventually, I got it to work by hitting the power button as hard as I could with the open palm of my hand.  I did this for about a month, but just got tired of winding up and hitting the power button as hard as I could in order to get it to work.  So, I just took it down to our local electronic recycle center, and am back looking for a new Non-Krups burr grinder."
1300,5,"Ok, I confess, we use our blender alot in our house for smoothies....but after the second one broke in 5 years and we tossed the Cuisinsart in the trash bin, I was determined to the research necessary to find a good one. There was no clear winner in the process....other than spending 400 dollars on a industrial one. So I went to Macy's and Williams-Sonoma to handle the goods and compare up-close. I was impressed with this model-- it had quality built into it especially when compared to other name brands. But then the online reviews mentioned leaking. From what I could ascertain, the bottom of the carafe is a bit fussy to tighten to point that the seal has a good grip (it comes with a tightening tool). I took a chance and I've been very pleased with the performance....it's not nearly as loud as our other blenders, the smoothie option is fantastic (no more renegade chunks!), and all the pieces seems rugged and tight fitting. Forget that this is remanufactured...it came like new even smelled so. If a problem develops, I'll be sure to return for an update...but so far, this is clearly one of the best values in the blender market."
1301,4,I was suprised that water taste so good.  but water cooler bottle was made with cheap plastic.   lid did not fit the bottle.
1302,5,Item Arrived Quickly & Exactly as Described.  PERFECT!!!
1303,5,The entire set of knives is great for the average kitchen.  We lost the 5-inch Santoku knife (someone left it in the pizza box and it was thrown out) and was able to order another from Macy's through Amazon.  The knives are easy to handle and are simple to sharpen.
1304,1,I love the metal cutters with the rubber grips - these are not as big as the regular Wilton cutters and they are plastic
1305,1,I bought this item at JC Penney. It makes good coffee. But I was not impress with the coffee flow to the cup. It spills all over if you don't get your cup all the way up for it to catch the liquid. Very disappointing. I will test it out next time I make a purchase.
1306,3,"We love the concept behind this grinder, but in less than a month the top completely broke off.  It's such a hassle having to get a replacement.  I would recommend the pepper and salt grinders that are separate."
1307,5,"Have owned this about 8 months and love it; no problems at all.  I bought it to use on my screened porched to keep grease and cooking odors outside.  I'm lucky that my porched is screened because I use this burner rain or shine, hot or cold outside.  I bought this because the \\""exhaust\\"" fan over my stovetop does not vent outside, so everything pulled in by the fan shoots out all over, spreading smoke, odors and grease everywhere.   I usually use the burner on the highest setting to super sear a steak and it works beautifully, though it takes about 7-8 minutes for the ready light to come on.  The empty fry pan sits on the unit while it heats up, so maybe that adds a minute or two extra.  But, no big deal--whats a few minutes?  I'm ordering one more today for my son & his wife who have the same problem with their kitchen fan.  They have a TINY condo balcony but it has a small table that will hold the burner.  I'm very happy with my purchase and highly recommend it."
1308,5,was a little wider than what I needed.  be sure to measure carefully.  more like an Italian bread size.  love all these pans for shaping dough.
1309,5,"This cupcake carrier is awesome! It's very large (holds 36 cupcakes), and it's very easy to use since each level stacks on top of the other and can be removed if necessary. The only downside with this carrier is that there isn't much room between each level. If you want to decorate your cupcakes more than the \\""normal\\"" amount of frosting, you may have to only use one level. This product is definitely worth the money."
1310,5,the blade is sharp<br />the handle is secure<br />the handle feels comfortable<br />the handle is grippy when wet<br />it has a good balance and weight<br />it's affordable.
1311,5,"Oxo is always tops in function and reliability. Its clean functionality lacks the pazazz of some of the others, but is easy to use and consistent, making it a must have kitchen tool.[[ASIN:B000WJMTNA Oxo 1130800 Good Grips Food Scale with Pull-Out Display]]"
1312,5,These forks were an addition to my original set.  The style or quality hasn't changed in 20 years.  They matched perfectly.
1313,4,I love my new salt and pepper shakers but they came with a missing plug for the salt shaker.  I followed the insturctions at Amazon and sent an e-mail to the company for the replacement.  First one came and was too large.  Second try and same thing.  I gave up and am now using a cork.  It works.
1314,5,So cute! I bought this as a whimsical decor item for my baby girl's nursery. It goes perfectly with her pink and chocolate damask bedding and bird/owl prints. Adorable!
1315,1,Been through 5 of these before giving up on them.  The spikots are cheap and will leak. They may work the first time serving but they will break very soon.  There is no getting around it.
1316,1,"My husband and I have had a set of mikasa cheers double old-fashioned glasses for the last five years.  We received them as a wedding gift.  We love them, my husband uses them for everything.  After five years of very regular use, being put in the dishwasher, and even dropped a few times, one of them broke.  It was my husband's favorite of the bunch, so I decided to order another set.  These are not the same glasses.  They may look the same in the picture, but the difference in quality is astounding.  The old glasses have thick, heavy bases and a substantial feel to them.  The replacements I ordered from amazon are just cheap - the glass is lighter at the bottom and very thin at the top, and the etching quality is nowhere near the same.  I was going to write and complain already, but then tonight, on the first use of one of the glasses, my husband put ice in it and it broke just from that.  As I pulled a second one out of the dishwasher to put it away, it was already broken.  So two of the four glasses have not even made it through one single use.  Unacceptable.  I'm requesting my money back."
1317,5,"This is one of the best purchases i have made online for our kitchen, which my family finds it to 100% useful."
1318,3,"I purchased this mat due to the fact that it was made in USA.  I was inexpensive and I was in need of a pastry mat with basic markings.  For the things I make most frequently, I highlighted the hash marks on length and width to the sizes I use most, as the ruler markings are difficult to read.  It stores nicely with my baking pans standing up, so I don't have the issue of getting it to lay flat.  I have avoided putting anything hot on it until I am able to find a made in USA silicon pastry mat.  The recipes are illegible but this is not the reason I purchased it.  It reminds me of the Tupperware pastry mat my mom had for years.  It will do for the time being."
1319,1,I have used this toaster less than 3 months and it no longer funtions properly.  It only gets used three or four times a week so it is not abused.  The handle no longer locks down so it is useless.  I see other reviews that have the same complaint.  Think twice about this one even though Black & Decker has had a good reputation in the past.
1320,3,"Bought this at BB&Beyond because of coupons and gift card. If you like your coffee piping hot, this is not the machine for you, but the carafe does keep the coffee warm for a very long time, especially if you preheat the carafe with hot water. It also takes more coffee grounds than my old Mr. C to make the equivalent strength of coffee for some reason. Love the controls and it makes the coffee very quickly. Pouring is no problem, unless you have an issue with strength in your wrist, as you do have to put a small amount of pressure on the release button while holding the pot at a fairly sharp angle. Glad that it uses the cheaper basket-style filters instead of the cone-type. Overall, a nice looking and well designed machine, but wish the coffee came out hotter."
1321,5,"We were looking for a long slot (narrow width) toaster in SS and found this one. It works great for slices of different widths and has blue LED lights to count down to finished toast.  It looks good on the counter top and does a nice even job of toasting bread, english muffins, and bagels."
1322,5,Product works well.  Easy to clean. Haven't had it very long but so far so good.
1323,5,"My wife and I love the Nesco FD-75PR.... It does everything it is supposed to do. One thing we learned... the 5 trays that come with it are not enough. Another thing we learned, use your shopping skills and buy another one rather than trying to buy extra trays. You can get all the trays and the fun stuff, plus a new blower head for less than adding the trays.  Tom"
1324,5,Spaetzle is so easy and this stainless steel spaetzle maker makes it perfect.  Try it and you will love it.
1325,4,"I got this as a gift and have had it a couple weeks. It's great, mostly. Feels well made, clever design, nice range of coarseness adjustment (you can set it really coarse, which I like), and it's easy to refill once you figure out the top pulls off.<br /><br />A couple cons:<br />1. The price.<br />2. The logo. Who wants to pay $40 to spend the next 10 years staring at a giant advertisement sitting on their table? The manufacturer's logo should never be the dominant visual element of an item like a salt and pepper grinder, in my humble opinion. But this may bother you less.<br />3. To adjust the coarseness of the grind, you turn a little whatzit on the bottom. Turn it one way for finer, the other way for coarser. Trouble is, they're not marked, so you never know which direction to turn it without experimenting. A simple little detail would have improved the design.<br /><br />Bottom line: its a quality product that works well, but it's not for everyone and the visual design could be better."
1326,1,I had mine for about 5 weeks before the plastic holder for the plunger's screen broke. The Carafe never breaks due to the plunger breaking before the Carafe has a chance to.
1327,5,"These little guys were a lifesaver when we had to move all of the furniture out of the first floor of our house on short notice. We bought three boxes, and they've all managed to come in handy! You never really realize how much you strain yourself trying to move things that are really too heavy for you- that is, until you get a bunch of these sliders, wedge them under that couch/table/piano/dresser and slide it easily across the room or even across the house! Then you feel just how much energy you saved! I can guarantee that anyone who uses these for the first time will get a huge grin on their face at just how easily their dauntingly heavy piece of furniture slides across any kind of carpet. (I can also guarantee that when you've moved the piece of furniture, you'll grab the sliders to do some carpet skating!)    Then there is the added convenience of not having to remove every single thing from whatever it is you're moving- a dresser can be moved without removing the drawers, for example, and we were able to move our bookshelves without removing the books. It saves much time and effort.     The only con to these sliders (and it is just a small gripe) is that they are bright orange! Not a big deal when you're just going to be moving something and putting them away. But we use these for our living room table, which gets moved often- so we just leave the sliders there. They're also very useful for putting under the feet of furniture that you don't want to make a dents/grooves in your carpeting, and the bright orange is an eye-grabber."
1328,5,"After much review of coffee grinders, I decided on the Capresso because of the features. After using it several times, I was very impressed and glad I made the decision  to purchase it.  The grind is uniform, easy to clean and very easy to use.  I expect it will last a long time."
1329,3,I decided my kitchen was just too small for it.  Kinda a hassle to clean too.
1330,4,I have been happy with this new kitchen tool.   My initial assessment is that it works as advertised.  It saves time and I have not nicked myself as I do when making fine cuts.  My only concern it the longevity of the cutting blade.  Only time will tell.  It is easy to clean.  I would still purchase this item again as it has met my needs.
1331,5,"My boyfriend and I bought this a few weeks ago, now we wish we could have this with us when out at restraunts. I love it."
1332,5,"I was greatly surprised. What a great product for an incredible price. First skeptic, but when I received, I was surprised and very happy."
1333,5,We love the fact that almost all the popcorn is popped when we are done. There is less than 1/2 a handful of any hard kernels or partially popped kernels.  We also get twice the yield we used to get in our air popper plus the kernels are fluffier.  We would highly recommend this product and we would buy it again.
1334,2,"What is up with this new pricing? $15 for 1 quart?? Seriously??!! I had enjoyed making my own, but at this new price, I guess it is back to the grocery store."
1335,1,"I bought these canisters about 3 years ago.  At first they were great but once any kind of food or liquid hit them, they were marred.  I've tried to clean them with copper cleaner which only resulted in me removing the \\""satin\\"" finish.  They are now ugly and all I can think to do is to spray paint them \\""copper\\"" again.  Otherwise, they will go downstairs to my husbands workshop to hold nails and screws.  Save your money!"
1336,3,"I received this set as a wedding gift, and have used many knives daily for the past 3.5 years. Some time ago I noticed that the larger chef's knife developed a major crack in the handle. Many of the steak knives too, have begun cracking. I do a lot of cooking and baking, so I do use them frequently. However, I have never once put any of this in the dishwasher. I wash each knife carefully by hand, and they are always treated with care. I do hope to upgrade to a nicer quality set sometime in the future, but for now I am stuck with them. It is a nice looking set, but if you are looking for long lasting durability and quality, keep looking."
1337,5,"My wife has been using the foodsaver now for about 10 years. We only use foodsaver original bags.  We have stored fish & chicken for 2 to 3 years successfuly in our freezer with no freezer burn & suprisingly the food tastes like it was just made. We buy chicken at Costco & cut it up to serving size portions & then we vaccum out the air & put in the freezer and when we want it just take out the bag & let it defrost & beleive me it tastes like we just bought the chicken that very day!   The bags are reusable, just wash with soap & water & let them dry & u can use them over again.  The foodsaver saves us alot of money !!"
1338,2,"I received this mug as a Christmas present after I added it to my wish list. I use travel mugs almost daily, but was looking for one that was dishwasher-safe. I was drawn to the minimalist design of this one and liked that it was easy to clean. Unfortunately, the lid leaks at the most inopportune times, leaving a trail of coffee, and coffee stains, to ruin the clean, smooth exterior. It can be quite messy, and at times, I have found it to dribble down the front of my chin and onto my shirt.   Additionally, it holds approximately 8-10 oz of your favorite warm beverage. Had I known the carrying capacity was relatively small compared to my other travel mugs, I probably would not have wished for it. While the cup should be well insulated due to the double wall porcelain, I do not find it keeps my beverage warm for very long.   I have read that some users note their lid does not have an airflow hole in it. Mine does. Perhaps this is why it leaks?   In any case, I would recommend this product only for its form. The function just isn't there."
1339,1,"We bought the three piece sectional for a great price. We spent a lot of time in the store sitting on it, checking it out, and trying to decide to buy it. We got it home and it looks great, was easy to assemble. After a couple of weeks sitting on it, there are now huge gaps between the cushions, they move all over the place and it is just very uncomfortable. I would not recommend this furniture to anyone."
1340,5,"This is a wonderful shaker.  I really love the measurements in the lid.  It's a bit less messy than pouring shots into a jigger and then dumping them into a shaker, then using a traditional strainer.  The attached strainer is different... holes, rather than a traditional strainer, however, I find it just as functional with less cleanup."
1341,5,I love this product so much I have two of them.  Love the convenience.  I use the programmable feature - love the 24 hour clock and the 4 hour warm feature.  Great product
1342,5,"These cups look great, wash easily, and are a nice size. Will definitely purchase again as a gift or myself."
1343,5,"This is a great rice cooker.  I've used it twice a week since I bought it.  My rice comes out perfect each time.  My wife, who cooks the old fashion way even loves it.  I think maybe because I'm doing the cooking!  But really, a great appiance for a great price.  Especially for us non cooking type guys.  And it keeps it warm for 12 hours after you have it done.  I'm on a diet and use only the brown rice, great for that too.  Easy as a toaster to use, less mess."
1344,5,This pan is like the one my mom used when I was growing up. I love it and feel much safer using stainless steel than non-stick pans.
1345,5,I got this Toastess Electric Kettle about 1 year ago. Oh is it so convenient when you just need quick hot water. I make ice tea in the summer by heating up this kettle as well as my hot tea in the winter. When company comes over it is so easy to serve tea and there is no fuss. The fact you can take it off the base and set it directly on a table without any heat to the bottom surface is another plus. I do recommend this to anyone that has use for this type item. I will be buying another one when this one goes but so far no problems very reliable. Sleek looking too!
1346,5,"Just like any thermos you would fill the container with hot tap water and let it sit for 10-20 minutes before using. However for optimal results, I recommend using boiling water to let it warm up the steel thermos and set the 4 mini container in hot tap water. With these method , the result was exceptional good, the food stayed HOT for 6-7 hour, then warm after.    How much each container will hold?    Starting with the biggest, the 3rd container holds about 1 and 1/2 cups of water. The con about the container is that it is not leak proof, so storing liquid food is out of the option for the biggest one, however 1 and 1/2 cup of rice is just enough to satisfy your appetite. It can fit about 2 drops/rolls of cooked noodle, or pasta. The soup and sauce can be filled from other separate containers    The 4th container in the bottom hold about 1 full cup of water, this container is bottle cap screw tight, so liquid can be used. There is a little blue tip that you can press to release the air out before opening. Since I'm an avid fan of Chinese cabbage (Bok Choy), it can fit 3 big pieces of these undismantled to demonstrate how much it can hold.     The 2nd container holds about 3/4 cup of water, it is a snap on lid like most plastic containers, the snap on lid are tight and liquid is workable with these container. But it is not recommended to be to filled fully. I used this container for storing meat or vegetable or sea food. If I bring noodles that is stored on the 4th container, this container will usually hold some soup to pour in my noodle.    The 1st container holds about 1/2 cup of water, Since this container is sitting in close and outmost to the steel lid of the container, it is likely to be cooled first, so storing warm food is not recommended with this one. Fruits and cool/cold treats may be ideal with this one.    The spoon holder is snapped on in the bottom of the thermos.    This steel thermos can hold more than enough for a full meal. Other than that, I need to purchase a smaller set of chops stick to fit inside the spoon holder."
1347,5,"I am a big tea drinker. I think this product is awesome for making that quick pot of tea in the early morning hours. Since I like my tea stronger, I need to put in a few more teabags. But on the whole , I  need this product. This is obvious, since I purchased two."
1348,5,Excellent glove for working in a lab.  Now everyone else wants to use my gloves!  Very good price.  AAnd they last for almost the entire lab.  Depending on what chemicals we are utilizing.
1349,5,"ITEM WAS AS DESCRIPTED, SAME AS THE ONES YOU PAY TWICE AS MUCH FOR FOR HALF THE PRICE!"
1350,3,"Purcahsed this as the painted aluminum one I had was chipping.  It looks really nice and works as expected, but there are some quality issues.  First the handles don't line up together perfectly - not a big problem.  More importantly, after a few uses the pivot pin fell put and could not be put back in and tightened as it was too short.  The seller (LUCCA) would not replace it as defective.  I ended up going to Home Depot and buying 1-1/2\\"" 10-24 stainless bolt and a stainless lock nut to replace the pivot pin (you really need a 1-3/8\\"" bolt, but I did not bother cutting it down).  This resolves the issue, but considering the price of the item, it should not have been necessary to do a repair.  If you are considering purcahsing this, it is better than the aluminum ones, but be warned it may come apart and don't buy one from LUCCA."
1351,5,We're using these salt/pepper shakers as our wedding cake topper (the cake people are decorating them to be bride and groom). They are the perfect size and will make a nice momento to keep and use in the kitchen!
1352,4,"I see a lot of reviews about using the kettle for tea, but it is also great for coffee preparation, especially french press and pour-over manual brewing. I was looking for something that I could more accurately gauge temperature and this definitely fills those shoes. I also got this over the other, because the settings allow for any water temp, so i figured I could use it for heating bottles or melting chocolate or other kitchen tasks that require warm but not boiling water.     What was done right:  1. Infinite temp adjustment. the competing models have 3 to 5 settings. thats, well, dumb.  2. Compact base  3. stainless interior  4. easy to pour spout   5. two prong plug for vintage kitchen outlets (like mine)    My complaints:    1. It doesn't seem to shut off after the warming period. If you dial in the temp you want.  2. The temperature fluctuates a fair bit. If I want my water to be 198, i set it at about 194, because it will heat up to 202-210 then slowly cool and when it gets below 194 it will heat too quickly and go back to about 198. Just like anything, it requires a little patience to get it right. The green light should beep when the temp is stable, not when it first reached your desired temperature.  3. The graduate marker to determine volume is really kludgy, as someone else in a review pointed out. Mine came detached. It was a nice idea, poorly engineered.     All said, for the money this is probably the best product I saw and am pleased with my purchase."
1353,1,"Ordered this after many months waiting with it on my wish list. Due to miss handling or wrong address, wasn't delivered (said address was incorrect! - order had correct address that I always use and many things have been delivered successfully) so was sent back by postal service and currently sits in Dallas according to the USPS tracking #. I'm dissappointed, frustrated (many calls to both USPS and FedEx), and angry. I still don't have the sandwich tray. Amazon did say they were refunding my money which is good but the package is still in Dallas and not here in Las Cruces. Amazon wouldn't send a replacement because they don't have the produst anymore. I WANT MY SANDWICH TRAY!!!!"
1354,5,"I have little more to say, except \\""Ditto to every 5 star review for this item on Amazon.\\"" This Thermos is literally the very best water bottle that I have ever owned, bar none. Considering the top notch quality of this product, it is worth every cent (and more.) I love this so much that I am buying another one for my wife as well. There is not one thing that I dislike about it (and THAT is really saying something for me.) I have read some reviewers that are worried about losing the lid gasket. I can envision where that could possibly happen, but that possibility is definitely not a deal breaker for buying the best water bottle on the market (IMHO.) I own two other Thermos water bottles (18 oz) that have a pop up spigot that you have to suck the water from. It loudly chirps when you drink from it. They are all equal in their near perfect thermal qualities, but THIS one allows me simply push a button to pop it open to chug my water without the neighborhood wondering where all the racket is coming from. If you are like me and love to drink ice cold water throughout the day, you will absolutely love this water bottle. Really."
1355,2,"This device is fairly intuitive but is rather fiddly (ie it has too many parts, comes apart in odd places, and has things that move that might be better off not moving).  It did radishes fine with the julienne setting but carrots didn't work.  I felt I had to put too much pressure on the carrots to get them through the blades and the finger guard handle kept loosing it's grip on them.  The handle has four metal rods (like bbq skewers but not sharp) and a plastic disc with tiny teeth that moves up and down on the rods in synch with top of the handle (if you look closely at the picture you will see a circle on the handle, that's the part that lifts up).  The tiny teeth really don't help hold on to stuff if you can't stab it with the metal rods.  All in all it didn't work as smoothly as I wanted it too and I didn't like the handle (and there's no way I'm using it WITHOUT the handle, I've already been to the ER once because of doing that with another slicer!)"
1356,4,I like this ibrik. It is large enough for two cups of coffee. Very comfortable handle. Perfect look with beautiful and high-quality painted decoration.   The only thing I don't like - the inner cover of the pot peeled off.
1357,3,"Not sure what measurement system, maybe another planet, but 3 cups?  This thing doesn't even do 2/3 of my coffee cup.  So have to make about two to four brews with this to get 1 to 2 cups of actual amounts.  Other than that I seem to feel it's a good price, of course that's why I bought this lower cost one.  Had I known it didn't even do one full cup I would have purchased something that at least did that - although not sure what size they would call it, maybe 5 cup?"
1358,4,"After having these a few days, I am very impressed with the quality of their thermal performance. If you put crushed ice in one to cool a soda at room temperature at 6PM, and there is still ice in the empty glass at 10PM, that's a great glass.    If your benchmark for rugged glassware is plastic, of course they are fragile, but in my estimation they are comparably tough to any fine glassware I've owned. Treat them delicately, and they will last. Don't pack them too tight in the dishwasher.    Of course, the large sizes will be more fragile than the small.    In my estimation, they do set a lovely table.  AFTER 4 MONTHS OF CONTIUNOUS USE -- still wonderful, and not a chip or a crack. Bug Amazon to restock these."
1359,5,"I am consistently amazed by this machine. I have had two previous espresso machines (both cheap Krups designs) and neither produced what I determine to be a \\""tasty shot.\\"" First off, I bought this machine at Dillard's for $40. Seriously. I was amazed that they were selling it so cheap. Having used it several times already I can say that it is the easiest machine I have ever used. Just put in coffee, tamp it down, and press go. When you have enough, press stop. The espresso it produces is thick, creamy and an extremely \\""tasty shot.\\"" My previous espresso came from a Bialetti style stovetop machine which made an amazing cup, but never had an espresso syrupy taste. This machine cleans up well and stores all accessories in its storage tray behind the drip tray. Don't hesitate to purchase (especially if you can find it cheaper or ever used)."
1360,5,"I purchased this for my husband and he absolutely LOVES it. He prefers this over regular \\""hunk of meat\\"" jerky."
1361,5,This pan works great. It is totally non-stick and doesn't seems like the coating will wear off after a few washings like other cheaper products seems to do sometimes. The baguettes that it makes are smaller then the size I was expecting so you just have to make sure you make the loaves small enough for the pan. I was expecting something between a traditional baguette and a sub roll and these are sized like traditional baguettes. If you need a baguette pan I highly recommend this one.
1362,5,Very happy to have this.  It works great!!!!  Love the spoon rest on the lid.  Love the colour.
1363,2,"Unfortunately, I have some Henckel products that date back to the nineteen twenties (beautiful scissors) and some to the nineteen forties (knives).  I don't think these can compare and they come with so many instructions:  how to clean, how to use.  I really haven't used them yet.  I wish they were still made in Germany.    Mallory Semple"
1364,5,"After reading the concerns with nonstick (I guess I'm a little behind on news!), I decided to switch to SS.  So far, I've been very happy with my decision, and extremely happy with the quality of the product.  It does take a little getting used to.  I found that it does make a big difference immediately after cooking, to remove the food and rinse the pan or soak if needed.  I have a gas burner and must keep on medium low or low.  The handles do tend to get hot if I'm cooking for a long time, but have now ordered a 5.5 quart to add to my collection! I would definitely recommend this set."
1365,4,"This is a great blender at a good price. It's powerful and solidly built, and the glass pitcher and base seem indestructible. Crushes ice easily and has made short work of any blending job we have."
1366,4,"I was a bit disappointed that it only holds a Small beverage, but the  benefits are worth it.  It cleans up like a dream!  Most places will give you a discount if you bring in your own mug.  And I'm  Saving the World One Cup of Coffee at a Time!"
1367,1,"I used this machine for a week.  Today, when I woke up and poured myself a cup of coffee, coffee poured out all over the warming plate and through to the table on which it stands.  It is an unsafe piece of equipment and cuisinart needs to hire a new designer to make their products safe.<br />I would not recommend this machine to anyone and take my word for it, you're better off with another brand."
1368,5,Excellent grinder. We have used also to grind other grains like flax and it works very well. Ido recommend to buy it.
1369,5,I'm surprised; this item is AWESOME !!  Follow the directions re. holding the handles (on the long side) when straining.  I didn't; and ended up w/spaghetti all over the place.  My fault.    I love this thing !!  Great product.
1370,5,I have had this for two weeks and it works great.  Worked good for small cookies without damaging nearby cookies. Scraped without any troubles.  7 years later and this turner is still in great shape and is.used often!
1371,4,"This is the first time I've bothered to write a review on something I've purchased through Amazon.  I eat exclusively brown rice and this rice cooker has no problems preparing it.  The directions contained in the manual for rice to water ratio work pretty well.    There are a few problems though, the boiling water bubbles up and \\""spits\\"" out the vent in the top making your counter a little messy.  The other problem I've had is trying to incorporate rice into every meal I eat.  Cereal & rice, ham sandwich & rice, Spaghetti & rice, you get the picture.    In summary, I am impressed with the Zojirushi appliance and I would have given it 5 stars if it didn't hock loogies all over my counter."
1372,5,This pizza cutter is great. Not flimsy. Got non-slip handle and comes with cap to cover the wheel. I use it all the time and it's fantastic.
1373,1,"I purchased this to replace one I had for 14 years.  What a waste of money.  It does not brown chicken.  Even at the 400 degree temp, the food takes forever to heat and cook.  I am so ready to just toss this in the garbage.  Rival should pay all owners a stipend to put up with this bad quality.  Shame on them!  Whatever you do, DO NOT BUY!!"
1374,4,"I purchased this pan about four years ago, and last week had to send it back (for the second time) to get it replaced due to the teflon non-stick surface degrading and peeling. Customer service is excellent. The first pan was replaced quickly free of charge. I only had to pay for shipping back to them which ended up costing about half the cost of a new pan.<br /><br />High heat is the cause of the teflon degrading. One must be very careful not to exposing the pan to the highest heat level on electric or gas oven and never leave unattended for long periods of time.<br /><br />Having said that, I really love this pan and use it every day, usually twice a day. I use it to make perfect three egg omelets in the morning and sometimes fry up a turkey burger during the day. When the non-stick surface is intact, it is a joy to use and clean, requiring only a wipe with a damp sponge.<br /><br />I recommend this pan with the caveat to avoid high heat, which is rarely necessary as this pan conducts heat very well.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Update on November 30, 2008<br /><br />I  just received a new pan to replace my damaged crepe pan. Calphalon sent me a Calphalon One Fry Pan which is an upgrade from the pan that I sent back.<br /><br />Calphalon has the best customer service. While their prices may be high, you never have to buy another pan for the rest of your life (or at least as long as the company remains in business)."
1375,5,Without too much effort you really can get a knife sharp enough to shave with.  Literally.
1376,5,"Make sure you order 2! This entire line is beautiful and heirloom quality! We added all of it to our wedding registry and got it for showers, it was perfect for use on our wedding day! We have the both platters, the goblets, and the unity candle. All will be cherished and will certainly stand the test of time! Highly recommended as a sincere quality gift."
1377,5,"this was a real bargain for really great cutlery; the knives are beautiful; the feel and balance of each knife lets you know that these are fine cutlery; they cut through \\""like butter\\"".  you won't be disappointed."
1378,4,"Toddy makes great coffee and it makes life easier to have it around. It's a little flimsy feeling, but the results are great."
1379,4,"This is a great way to get kids started with a love of the kitchen and an appreciation of things made at home.  The knives are real and they are sharp.  The only ding I can give is that the glove is a bit big for a typical 8-year-old's hand.  Other than that, it's a wonderful set."
1380,5,I read a review of this knife in Cook's Illustrated and decided to buy this product based on that review.  I've since bought several by this company and have to say that it is beyond a doubt the best knife I've ever owned.  It feels great in my hands and holds a excellent edge.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who spends as much time in the kitchen as I do.
1381,2,"I'm all for purchasing refurbished items. But this item seems to have missed the refurbishing tech. Appears more used, then refurbished.<br /><br />My espresso machine arrived today. It has a few scratch marks on the stainless. Top & one side. As well as, a small black pitted mark on the front chrome panel. But the unit does work.<br /><br />However, the ad states. a set of stainless steel cups, and frothing jug are included. NO cups, NO jug.<br /><br />I called Amazons help number. The CSR was kind enough to give me the number to Breville/HWI. I called, and was only able to leave a voice message. I then tried to send an e-mail to Breville/HWI. At the listed e-mail address on the instruction manual. askus@brevilleusa.com I tried this twice. Both times my e-mails were returned. Stating fatal error for this e-mail address.<br /><br />Anyway, Will see what happens. This is one refurbished item. That just may get returned. I will repost the outcome."
1382,4,"As other reviewers have pointed out the product is loud, but it works.  I last used it on the Fourth of July and got rave reviews for the ice cream.  Just follow the directions in the enclosed booklet.    For the price, this product seems to be a winner."
1383,4,"I got these pans because I was worried about toxins in the teflon type of pans.  These pans cook food beautifully.  At first I was using heat that was too high which caused food to stick to the frying pans and required a lot of soaking to get out.  Now that I put the heat much lower, I have not had any trouble.  I love being able to pop the pans and lids into the dishwasher - they come out looking like new!"
1384,4,"This is a nice coffee filter, a little bit more time consuming than paper filters, but works pretty good."
1385,5,"The very best....I was worried because of the shape and not fitting my stove top right but it cooks evenly and well...It's worth every penny I spent on ...Also ,,,easy to clean and nothing sticks to the bottom..."
1386,4,The grinder works well for the kind of coffee I like to drink (regular).  The burr grinder will not burn the beans and the settings are easy to learn.
1387,4,I splurged and bought this pan because I like to make homemade caramel sauce.  Once recieved it was not as deep as I thought it would be but I'm sure the Mauviel people know what they are doing.  I loved the pan but sent it back because there was no hole in the handle for hanging on a pot rack.  I really wanted to hang it.  I spent so much money there was no way I would hide it in a cupboard.  I didn't have the heart to drill a hole in the handle.
1388,5,"Great look! Great feel, works like a charm for snowboarding, at the movies or sporting events! easy to clean, worth it"
1389,4,"Some stand mixers come with 2 different bowls, and I have always considered this a very smart idea. That was the only think I thought that KA was missing to be the best mixer.   Well I bought the 3quart bowl and I am very glad. There are times when you really need an extra bowl to mix separate ingredients and this thing is what you need.  I agree that then handle is missing, but considering the small size, this is not a must, and the good news is that due to the missing handle you can keep it inside the big bowl saving space. I have never had problems with the ingredients flying across my kithcen, just keep the mixer at slow speed when mixing dry ingredients.  In fact, this bowl is a great addition to your favorite mixer. Delivery by Amazon, was fantastic as always, and the price, the best!"
1390,5,This a great product I've been using up my leftover coffee with these pods   works great
1391,4,"After looking at several in stores I finally decided to buy this one.  It is good quality, gets a good seal and is not too expensive."
1392,5,"I have been using the crock pot for about 2 months, works great, no problems.  The programming function with the auto switch to warm is a real plus"
1393,4,Clock and Mirrors set.  Looks very nice on the wall.  I like it a lot. It came in a few days.  Great job!
1394,4,"frame looks very nice, simple but elegant. You can put your picture horizontally or vertically. I placed 8x10 picture and there was some place left in a frame, and it created very nice look. I purchased it as a gift from our department for a manager who took another position in company, and she liked it, as well as my coworkers. You can create engraving in a foundation."
1395,5,"After owning the B60 for six months now, I enjoy it more and more each week. I always now go straight home instead of stopping on the way at that $tarmoney place because this coffee is so good. If you like it strong I also recommend the 'Coffee People Bold Black Tiger' from Amazon.    I also got the 'Keurig My K-Cup Reuseable Coffee Filter' so I can experiment with some of the local specialty coffees for much less than K cup cost. BUT, the K cup sure is convenient.    I agree the unit is a bit loud, but it is in the same room as the dishwasher so I don't mind."
1396,5,I am very happy with this new pan. I replaced a pan that had burn spots on it and the new pan has not gotten any burn spots on it yet. The new pan works very well.
1397,2,"I've had this crock pot for a year and attempted to make about 40 dishes with it.  The problem I consistently have is that it cooks too hot and too fast on the \\""low\\"" setting.  I've never used the \\""high\\"" setting.  In the beginning I thought it was me and that I wasn't using it properly, so I kept trying.  But still, every meat item was terribly overdone and dry.  Vegetables turn into complete mush.  Whenever I made stuffed peppers or cabbage rolls they looked beautiful, but I was unable to take them out of the crock pot because when I used the tongs they totally fell apart.  I found out that 6-8 hours was way too long and that 3-4 was about perfect.  So I started going home during my lunch break and turning it on at that time (instead of in the morning) and that usually works pretty well.    I don't know if I have a defective unit or not.  No one else I know has this particular model so I can't talk to them.  I want to get a new one but I'm hesitant to get a Rival.  I don't know if this is a widespread problem but it is what happened with mine."
1398,5,"After 31 years of faithful service my KitchenAid mixer went haywire. So when I went to Amazon I was delighted to find the model I wanted (an upgrade to Artisan) on sale. I am very pleased with it and find it is even easier to use than my previous mixer. I bake a lot of bread and also use the grater, slicer and grinder attatchments. I hope to get a grain mill soon. A bonus is the beautiful blue color!"
1399,5,"Just received 8\\"" mortar and pestle today. It is massive and so cool. Reminds me of old Inca carvings. Looking forward to having this in the kitchen for many years. So functional as well as an interesting peice of art. Thanks."
1400,5,"I work at a private school where most the teacher who want coffee have their own coffee pots in the classroom, and one of the teachers had a Hamilton Beach Brewstation. It was wonderful so I had to have my own. I bought this one about a month ago and I love it. I feel this is the best money spent on a coffee maker. Just like with all referbs you risk getting one that is not great but we have not had one single problem with ours. I recomend at least trying one at this price. Not only that the seller shipped it fast! I was making coffee with in a week of purchase."
1401,5,Bought this as a gift for mom. She loves it. The bottle is quite sturdy too. Shipping was very prompt and the packing was good.
1402,5,Little on the bulky side but other great thing are too good to pass. <br />Excellent product. <br />
1403,5,This napkin holder is very attractive. I particularly like the fact that the napkins are held in place.
1404,1,I admit I bought this because KitchenAid has been great in the past and it was red.  Every so often the coffee ends up not in the carafe but all over the floor and counter.  So i switched out the gold filter with a paper one and it still happens.  I am calling them now to see what they will do to fix the fact that it cost me $80 and i have had to clean up coffee 6 times!
1405,5,"Used to own a Power Chopper, but it became tedious keeping track of the parts (lost the rubber gauge, so it leaked constantly). The HB blender is much easier to assemble and keep track of (only four pieces). So easy to use and clean. Have had no trouble blending ice and frozen fruit."
1406,5,IT IS EASY TO USE.TOAST COMES OUT GOOD EVERY TIME.THE MAIN DRAWBACK IS THE FACT THAT YOU MUST RENOVE THE TRAY FROM THE BACK BUT THIS IS A MINOR INCONVENIENCE. <br />
1407,5,This pattern is really nice. I bought a place setting & a tea pot.I fell so elegent.
1408,3,Have always been a Vornado customer..so I was disapointed by the failure to stay on for long periods of time. I returned 1 unit only to have the same unit returned to me. I guess they tried it for a short time and decided it works. Well it does not work!!I think I'm stuck with this defective unit.
1409,4,We use the waffle maker 2-3 times a week for our kids and they love the results.  The flippable waffle iron surface / grtiddle is held in place by some chinzy metal catches but otherwise it performs very well.
1410,5,"My husband and I use these every day for work...I opened mine for the first time today around 10am to refill my travel mug, and I just opened it again at 5pm for another refill - coffee is still hot.  Not warm...hot.  We don't put milk or anything in them, just coffee - so not sure if that would change the temperature much.  These are fantastic, though - I highly recommend."
1411,5,"I take salads to work every day. This container makes it so easy to carry with me, even if where I'm going has no fridge. There's never any soggy salad since the dressing is only placed on the salad just before you eat (in fact, it's also easy to use if you're a \\""dipper\\""). My only complaint is that my forks don't fit into the compartment on the lid... and I don't like using plastic forks because they break too easily. I guess my forks are just too big."
1412,5,"I've had my Bunn coffee/tea machine for over a year now and am very pleased with its performance.  I love the convenience of making one cup of coffee or tea at a time.  I'm also able to use the machine for hot water when making my daily oatmeal or instant soups.  The hot water is measured in one ounce increments starting at 4 ounces and going up to 12 ounces, so it is easy to set it for just the amount of hot water you need.  <br /> <br />Since I've been dieting, I'm drinking a lot more green tea, and using this machine makes brewing one cup at a time a breeze.  I've already drop 30 pounds in four months just by switching to tea and eliminating of soda, juice, and alcohol from my diet. <br />"
1413,5,"I love this little machine. For a person with limited counter space, it's great. <br />I've used yogurt as a starter and powdered starter too and have had great results with both.  <br />When my batch is made, I immediately take off enough of that yogurt for my starter and make a new batch the next day. That's the best way to make it a moneysaver. <br />As others have said, you need to purchase a thermometer, but that's  no big deal. Amazon has enough to choose from. <br />The \\""hardest\\"" part is just making sure the milk doesn't boil and then waiting for it to cool to the proper temp. <br />Buy this! You'll love it!"
1414,2,"My wife brought this thing home to upgrade our old [original] GF grill.  <br />So, after reading a bunch of reviews, I cracked the box open  and played around with it a bit too see for myself. <br />Since the removable plates are a concern of others, I concentrated on them. <br />Sure enough, they are a bear to attach. <br />And I'm talking for *me*. [a reasonably mechanically inclined male] <br />My wife would be using the thing most, and she had a hard time with both plates -especially top one. <br /> <br />On closer inspection of the plate latching mechanisms, I can see why they don't work well: Just plain poor design. <br /> <br />Also, even when they are properly fastened, the plates are still loose and float around some. <br />This could cause issues with uneven heating because of poor contact between the plates and the surface over the heating element. <br /> <br />A better design would have the heating surface countersunk, and the back of the plates formed to mate securely. <br />[not to mention an idiot-proof latch with a positive 'click' when the plates are secured properly] <br /> <br />An amusing note: <br />There are 2 warnings [a sticker on top of the unit, and an orange paper in between the plates] that state: <br />IMPORTANT <br />'Make sure that BOTH release handles of the grilling plates are properly latched and secured on the grilling machine body before use.' <br /> <br />Riiiiight! <br />Here's an IMPORTANT tip, Salton: <br />Make sure that your products aren't so rinky-dink as to warrant such warnings! <br /> <br />This poorly designed appliance shall be returned."
1415,5,"I have read so many negative reviews of this wonderful little moka machine, I must put in my 2 cents. First, this is a stream machine, meaning it makes moka not espresso. If you like Bialetti but want cappuccino instead of cafe latte, then this is perfect. The grind must be close to espresso, finer than for Bialetti, and you must tamp it down, but no tamper included. There is only 1 knob, yes it is stiff, but i don't have arthritis. The round design makes it easy to handle even though it is very light. It descales with...vinegar! How about that, actually a traditional machine. The panarello works, just put in extra \\""cup\\"" of water for steaming. Make 2 \\""cups\\"", not 1 or 4, and always start with cold machine, or use very, very cold water. Stop the brewing as soon as moka hits 2 \\""cups\\"" or it starts to steam instead of brew, then switch the knob to steam for the milk. If you don't, coffee will taste slightly burned. I have owned espresso and moka machines from USD5 to USD1,000 over a period of 40 years. If you like moka, don't waste money on anything more expensive. But, like any machine, read the manual, and experiment if things don't work the way you want. Finally, garbage in garbage out. If you want great cappuccino, use good organic coffee and organic milk."
1416,5,"When choosing any cutting tool, whether you're slicing food or shaping wood or anything else, three things are desirable: <br /> <br />1. Your tool should hold an edge for a long time (although nothing holds an edge forever) <br />2. It should be easy to sharpen <br />3. It should resist corrosion and/or staining <br /> <br />Unfortunately, there's a law of metallurgy that you can't ignore -- PICK ANY TWO of the three. Sorry about that, we just have to deal with it. And as pretty as stainless steel knives are, the problem with stainless is that once the edge is dull it's nearly impossible to get it back. Choose SS kitchen knives and within a year they'll be useless for cutting anything. The sad thing is that consumer preferences ave driven practically everything *except* SS knives off the market. <br /> <br />I was incredibly happy when I found these, and when I got them they didn't disappoint. I'll confirm all the positive things others have said about these knives -- beautiful fit-and-finish, handy to use, everything else. Best of all, they are SHARP and unlike a SS chef's knife you're able to KEEP them sharp. It's a superior product. Toweling them off after washing them by hand is a very small price to pay for having a knife that actually WORKS."
1417,5,I've had this thermometer for over a year and I use it constantly. My favorite way to use it is on the grill outside. Pork loins and chicken breasts cook fast on the grill--it's best to know exactly when they're done. I just leave a window open and listen for the alert. A busy Mom's best friend!
1418,5,"In doing research on toaster ovens I've come to the conclusion that people have unrealistic expectations of toaster ovens. They're toaster ovens, people, not full-sized ovens. <br /> <br />If what you expect of a toaster oven is to bake small items, make the occasional slice of toast, and reheat leftovers without turning them into steaming goop like a microwave does, then you're looking in the right place.  <br /> <br />I'm not at all convinced that the \\""convection\\"" feature does all that much, but I can say that so far I have baked cookies, reheated pizza, and cooked Tyson Chicken Patties and tater tots with excellent results. Oh yeah, and I've even made toast. Best $50 (bought elsewhere) I've spent in a long time.  <br /> <br />Don't want to heat up your big ol' oven and your house to reheat some leftovers? Get this toaster oven.  <br /> <br />-Doug <br /> <br />"
1419,5,"I recieved this machine as a very early x-mas gift, I was always @ *bucks spending $5 3-4x daily, withen 10 min. of unpacking this machine I was drinking the best latte that I ever made. Forget those cheap machines that try to emulate espresso, as you know, you get what you pay for and it's proven with this beautiful machine, I was just a little surprised that the clock bezel was plastic but it is very good plastic!! the Machine is heavy,solid and very well put together, solid brass pumps and parts, a true work of art, I look at it as a fuctional sculpture for my kitchen!!!!! Happy brewing !!!!"
1420,4,"This chair is hip yet understated enough to fit into many different types of decors.  I'm no Bob Villa, and assembly took about 15-30 minutes.  Simple, stylish and sturdy, this Tribeca Padded Chair could be a great addition to your living area.  Great for kicking back and watching the game, or as extra seating for visitors."
1421,5,"I found this on sale for $19.89, what a steal. Even though you missed that it is well worth the $40 it is now going for. I've had it for 2 weeks and used it twice. Last week I made chicken & dumplings. This is the perfect pan for that as it has a huge surface area which means you can plop in lots of dumpling dough. In fact almost too much dough. I'm making a pot roast in it tomorrow and I think it is gonna work great. Great pan!!!"
1422,5,"Very, very, very useful. Will buy again if I have a chance. Will recommend to my family & friends."
1423,5,I love it.  I wasn't sure when I first ordered it but now that I have it I hate to use anything else.  I am putting in more orders soon.
1424,5,"Bought this pan (at full price) 3 yrs. ago on the advice of my sister & have used it constantly ever since. This is the older line of Calphalon Commerical hard anodized cookware, used to be its most expensive line & is excellent.  The price reflects the fact that it has been discontinued (they manufactured this style, unchanged, for years) to make room for the more \\""modern\\"" styled Calphalon (to the dismay & protest of Calphalon fans)& is not a relection of quality or a problem w/the line. I've read previous reviews & am surprised people have such trouble w/food sticking.  Just follow the cookware directions & food won't stick (e.g., warm pan a little, then add oil/liquid or food.  If u follow these directions, clean up is easy, or requires a simple soak of hot water for 1 min., no big deal.  Remember, it's stick resistant, not stick proof. But, unlike Teflon pans, you can put this pan in the oven up to 550 degrees.  I've used this pan for loads of scrambled eggs.  I also always use it to saute fresh veggies (zucchini, onions, etc.), loads of mushrooms for our steak cookouts, rice, soups, two chicken breasts or a smaller, 1 lb. batch of chili.  Perfect generous size to saute veggies for 2-6 people. Comes w/a lid. Lifetime guarantee. A little staining or discoloration is common for all hard anadozied cookware, so this isn't a flaw, but rather common to the line."
1425,1,"I have been looking over some of the products and none of them , of the patio chairs , and folding chairs have no information about dementions, mainly height from the floor to the seat of the chair which is important. <br />This information would be especailly helpful for people with disabilities,or people who need more information about comfort. <br />thank you.  Robert."
1426,1,"If you like a great cup of coffee, and love spending lots of time cleaning and maintaining a coffee maker, then this product is for you. I would not recommend this machine to anyone, and I am taking my time here to discourage people from buying it. It has too many parts that need to be cleaned every time you make coffee (the internal grinder gets steamed up in the brewing process and gets caked with thick coffee muck).  In addition, a coffee tar build-up coats the entire inside of the machine and causes all the little mechanisms to stick.  For instance, the button release for the filter gets jammed and you have to reach up underneath to pull it out manually.  I also had the same experience as one of the other reviewers when during the grinding process, the filter door popped open and brewing coffee spilled everywhere. The grinder also gets stuck in the machine in the coffee sludge.  To keep the machine in working order,once a month, I find myself scrubbing it with a toothbrush under running water (not recommended by manufacturer).Also the carafe spout pours at a snail's pace, so you have too unscrew the lid anyway. Like I said earlier, it makes a great cup of coffee, but this grind and brew should have been engineered and designed better, especially with its high price tag."
1427,5,"Edit to update:  It's been almost eight years since I bought this pan and it's still practically in like-new condition.  I've used it a lot over the years for stove top cooking, oven use, and in particular stove-to-oven recipes.  I've done nothing more than treat it like the instructions said and it looks like it has another eight years or more left in it.  This was one of the first nicer pieces of cookware I bought and it's definitely been a good investment.  I'm as happy with it now as I was then.<br /><br />In the years since I bought this I've accumulated items like a real wok, Calphalon's wonderful grill pan, a good cast iron skillet, etc. but back in the day every one of those jobs was done by this everyday pan.  I used it for stir fry, cooking meats on direct heat, making pan sauces, searing roasts on the stove top and then putting the whole thing in the oven to cook.  It can do most anything, except work like a true non-stick skillet so I do recommend using something else for eggs.  I do not use it for boiling potatoes or pasta; for some reason I have it in my head that it's best to use stainless steel for that... although that could be completely wrong.<br /><br />I've used this pan for one recipe more than any other - chicken and mushroom sauce. Brown bone-in chicken breasts in the pan and remove/cover, then cook mushrooms in the pan, then deglaze the whole thing with wine or marsala or chicken stock.  Let the mushrooms simmer and scrape the pan while it reduces a little and you'll have a great sauce AND as a bonus it does most of the work of cleaning the pan when you sauce it up.<br /><br />For cleaning I usually soak it in hot water then give it a once over with a plastic scrubber, then use Comet or Bar Keepers Friend.  A scrubbing agent is necessary to keep it clean enough to release cooked foods properly and unfortunately sometimes it takes considerable pressure to clean the bottom of the pan.  You can however use Comet to clean all the surfaces of thepan and lid inside and out so even after years of use it will clean up nicely."
1428,5,"I finally gave up on my ancient set of yogurt jars when I broke too many of them. They weren't the greatest, and they didn't give foolproof results, but they DID give me fresh and inexpensive yogurt. Most of the time.  <br />I was a little leery of the new Salton system because it didn't use the little cups, but I figured I could just put the finished yogurt in some recycled marg containers. I was right; the one-quart system works smoothly and effortlessly. You have yogurt  in the space of a day with a minimum expenditure of time and energy, and the yogurt is simply superb.  <br />You heat up a quart of milk to the scalding point, then cool it back down to 110. you add some yogurt starter and put it into the heater for five hours. The system essentially consists of a heater jacket  and a plastic bucket that keeps the working yogurt at the right heat, until you cool it and put it in the fridge. The heater is beautifully designed to be simple and efficient. It is easy to wash and looks like it will last forever.  <br />The system comes with very complete and totally clear instructions that tell you what NOT to do as well as what TO do. I cannot imagine how anything could be easier than this process! And you gotta love the price. You should definitely buy a spot thermometer for monitoring the running-in temperatures, but you will have everything else you need in your kitchen already."
1429,5,"I got this mortar & pestle to grind pills for my cat.  It works wonderfully for that purpose.  It crushes the pills in a couple of twists to a fine powder I can mix with their food.  The capacity is small, but with the VERY reasonable price it is perfect for what I want to do."
1430,5,"Dirty Girl bubble bath is the most refreshing, reviving bubble bath I have ever used in my life!!! Try it you won't be sorry!"
1431,5,I love this grill.  I have changed my eatting habits with this and feel it has contribute to a 54lb weight loss in about 3.5 months.  Love it!!
1432,5,"What a great pan at a great price! You will be pleased when you feel the weight and see the beautiful high polished finish just like jewelry. This pan is nicely balanced and heats very fast and very hot. Interior is almost nonstick it is so high polished. Cleaning was easy and maintaining the copper can be done with a little polish and a soft cloth every now and then. Be careful with the handle, it will burn you without a potholder.I also purchased the 12 1/2&quot; stainless multiclad stirfry pan and the lid fits this great pan too! A+ on both!"
1433,4,"Although it is a bit noisy, it is not distracting...you can watch tv and carry on with a normal conversation with it running. <BR>Being able to do two different flavors at the same time is great..or even just double the amount of one flavor! <br />I would recommend this machine to anyone interested in making their own ice cream. After 25 minutes you have an ice cream with the consistency of soft serve. [Though sometimes you have to run it for longer because some ingredients add more liquid to the mixture, so naturally it won't be as firm as others. Also, for those of you complaining how you have to refreeze the bowls and run it again...you are most likely not freezing the bowls long enough in the first place.  For best results, leave the bowl unused in the freezer for at least a day...that way the liquid inside is COMPLETELY frozen.]  <br />After your ice cream is done, just put it all in an airtight container in the freezer for a half hour or so and VOILA...ice cream that rivals even Ben & Jerrys! You can make ANY flavor you want...that's the best part about it. Not enough chunks in your store bought ice cream? This is your solution, add as much as you want! Enjoy!"
1434,5,"Oh, dear God, I love these knives. Their weight in your hand is hefty without being tiring. The blades are sharp, precise, and easy to handle. And do they slice? I mean -- and do they SLICE!!!<br />After each meal, I hand-wash these instruments and give them a quick touch of the sharpening stone. I then gently, very gently, place them back into their case for safekeeping. Is it any wonder my fianc&eacute; is jealous?<br />I do have one complaint -- I only have four of these knives. I'm going to need at least eight more for the grilling I plan to do next summer. I mean, it's going to take a big patio party to properly show off these fine blades."
1435,3,"This attachment works OK--better than doing by hand.  This does not work so well sometimes when whipping in other incredients and allows for less control than a stand mixer offers.  This is definitely better than a hand blender, though."
1436,5,We just purchased the Simac Pasta Machine and I have to say it is great.  We made Pasta first time we tried it. I didn't weigh the flour but used 3 and 1/4 cups of sifted flour and eggs up to the egg level on the measuring cup. By the time the water was boiling I had pasta.
1437,5,"This Johnson Brothers Willow Blue Dinnerware 3-Dimensional Creamer is the companion piece to the Willow Blue 3-D Covered Sugar Bowl and Teapot. All three pieces have the pagoda design, with handpainted cobalt blue-on-white porcelain design that tells a love story. You will want to find a special shelf to display these three pieces when they are not in use. If you are not a collector of Willow Blue already, you will like to begin with the tea service and perhaps two or four place settings to be used when you serve Asian foods."
