0,5,We put these around our cupcakes for our wedding and they were so cute. They went so well with our country chic decor as well.
1,5,I have to say I think these are the coolest things.I am very very happy with the 12 ice balls from home complete ! I have purchased a few of these in the past and decided I needed more. These are awesome balls to add to your favorite alcoholic drinks and even to your kids drinks ! My kids think these are awesome things . I have found that you can use these for different things . I have made kool aid popsicles with these before and another thing I like to do is put cooled coffee in the molds and then freeze them and add them to milk or cream and its just a new and cool way to have a coffee drink through out the day . These work great and I have no complaints or issues about these and they clean up very easy ! Overall Very Very Happy with these!<br /><br />I received these at a reduced rate for my fair and unbiased opinion
2,5,Bought couple of those as a gift.<br />Looks very cool.
3,1,"First I want to say that the seller did perfectly good job shipping the product, the product was exactly as described and in good shape.  The problem is that this product is absolutely useless.  The squeeze bottle is supposed to replace a pastry/piping bag.  Instead it exhausts your thumbs and fingers squeezing it to death, only to leave 30% of the batter stuck in the crevices.  The lid is hard to snap in place once batter's in it and when you squeeze batter goes everywhere making a giant mess.  The silicon mat is useless; you could use parchment paper just as well.  What's worse is the instruction manual displays macaron shells that are cracked and uneven -- it practically encourages you to fail.  It's my fault for trying to cheat my way through a challenging pastry.  I'm going to learn to make it right instead of wasting my money again."
4,5,Love this item.
5,5,Works exactly as expected. No issues. Keeps the grains from entering the drain valve on my mash tun.
6,5,"great toaster, I use it almost every day"
7,3,"Nice and durable. But I can't seem to get rid of the factory taste, hence the three stars"
8,5,"These are really handy!  The silicon thongs are great when cooking when a spatula just won't cut it when picking up specific pieces to flip over or take out of the pot.  I like that there are two sizes and I prefer the shorter one for everyday use, and the longer one for like taking things out of big pots.  I was worried that the little knubs would get in the way, but they don't at all for me.  I like that it stands up on its own without making a mess!  I recommend this!"
9,5,We love it and want to get another bowl to have an extra.
10,5,Easy to use!
11,2,"These cookie cutters were HUGE. I honestly don't know how many cookies they expect people to get out of these. I ended up taking out all the letters and numbers (and a tiny circle and heart) and giving the rest to a co-worker who bakes a lot hoping she might get some use out of them.<br /><br />If you want a set of cookie cutters that will allow you to make more than 2 cookies, probably get a different set."
12,5,great product
13,5,"Came as ordered, unfortunately I found I can't fit them in my cabinet and will have to return."
14,5,Been using heavily for about a month. They do the trick. Perfect.
15,5,fun bag
16,4,"My husband loves this toaster, so this review is on behalf of his feedback.  I just place the orders and provide product review for my Amazon buddies.  Husbands feedback - &#34;It's cool that it has the ability to toast 2 different set of toasts / bagels, on different settings.&#34;  Me personally, I think it's just okay and does the job.  Good price though, which is why I agreed to buy this for our family.  I normally would not pay this much for a toaster, but to each his own."
17,5,great
18,5,This scoop is perfect. I was using a different ladle and it was hard to pour into the funnel. I still use the funnel but this scoop is much more user friendly. Also very helpful in the corners of the pan to scoop the last bit out.
19,5,LOVE THIS SCALE GREAT PRODUCT FOR CHEAP PRICE
20,5,"Great item. I purchased one for my daughter, and had to have one for myself! Holds a lot. Easy to clean. Visible water level is a great idea.  I would recommend this product."
21,5,Love them
22,5,Pretty and small.  Good for 1 or two people.  To me it gives an elegant look to our kitchen.
23,5,Beautiful. Easy to use. Poked right through the fondant without problems.
24,5,I used it last night. It has a lot of power. The green color makes me happy!
25,2,"The product doesn't work as advertised. ice-balls end up connected with a sheet of ice. There is a sheet of ice on top cover too. There is no easy way to fill up the container to correct level. If you overfill, you can have the water come out via too holes.. but there is no way to drain that water out. I just want the ice balls. No sheets and powered ice. The ice balls also sticks to the mold maker."
26,5,"I only wish I would have found this sooner before I bought those insulated ugly mugs that have a black lining. I ordered a tumbler that is coming tomorrow, yay. These are very pretty. I didn't know the 24 ounce came as a mug as well, now I may have to get even another one"
27,4,Great price for a good tool!
28,5,"Perfect, little coffeemaker..."
29,5,This is my second.  Love it.
30,5,In exchange for this product I am giving a non biased review.  These colanders are great space savers.  I plan on using them in the camper!
31,5,This mold made the best ice balls for our party! Used them in a punch and they were great. Takes about 4-6 hours to do 4; bought 2 molds because... well.. I am pretty popular. Turned out 20 in a day. Spent the whole weekend preparing. Warning- not for use in snowball fights.
32,5,"Quick, hot water!"
33,5,"spreader is one piece of metal so no separation of handle.  nice heft for the size.  we use these daily to butter toast, spread cream cheese, etc.  they also make great hostess gifts - who couldn't use a set of spreaders?"
34,5,Exactly as described.
35,5,"The design of this pitcher is so far superior -- it's surprising that no one thought of this before.  It fills much, much faster.  Takes much less time to start a new filter.  Takes less space in the fridge to store the same amount of water.  I think water is probably different city to city, so I'll just speak for my town (NYC).  Here, the water tastes fantastic.  I never take the time to review things, but I just couldn't resist in this case.  Really great product."
36,5,Always great glasses
37,5,The work great and are easy to wash
38,4,"Love the size of this cutting board and love that it can be put in the dishwasher, especially when used for meat.  I recently had to cut up a dozen or so watermelons and it was nice to have a board with channels built in for all the juice!  The one thing I didn't like was that the board was left with cut marks when I used my good knifes on it.  It will make it harder to clean."
39,3,"These are kind of brittle and tend to crack if you bend too much, and the ice doesn't come out that well."
40,5,Great quality lunch box that should hold up throughout the year!
41,5,The CocoGapor is a great tool for a novice coconut guru. It allowed us to enjoy our very first fresh coconut. The tools make it much easier to enjoy a coconut than we could imagine.
42,5,"I really was opposed to spending the money this machine costs.  My wife wanted a new blender and I wanted to spend $30.00 on a Wall-Mart special.  She prevailed and I ordered this one.  I have to say it has really opened my eyes concerning what a blender is capable of doing.  The single serve glasses are a great addition and make excellent protein shakes and smoothies.  The blender itself is awesome.  Be ware, the blades on this unit are SHARP.  You'll want to exercise above normal caution when you clean them."
43,5,Does as it says
44,5,Fantastic product
45,5,Thank You
46,5,glass is nice and thick and they look awesome
47,5,This makes wonderful coffee!
48,1,The spoon rear is so small that not  even a spatula can rest on it . Very disappointed!!
49,5,As advertised and fits multiple lids of assorted sizes easily. I mounted it on the back of the pantry door.
50,5,Colorful and sturdy.  Good price.
51,5,Love it
52,5,ok
53,5,easy to use and easy to clean
54,4,I didn't read the description well enough... this is a paper table cloth.  Tears very easily so be careful!
55,4,:)
56,5,Great product.  Boxes go together easily and the paper quality is excellent.  The rounded top is unique and stays smooth after assembly.  Plan to stamp boxes and add ribbon for gifts.  Wish I would have had these for my daughters wedding shower to use for favors.
57,5,awesome
58,1,"Just a disclaimer I did not bother returning this item, or give the seller a chance to refund. it was not worth the effort.<br /><br />The lid is and the interior are divided but it does not keep the food separated if the container were to be turned over. You can't put it in a lunch box for that reason. The lids do not staples into place tight enough. Definitly not leak proof.<br /><br />Very flimsy plastic. 3 of the 6 lids came cracked and broken and I couldn't use them. I ended up just throwing it all away and accepted my loss. I actually found better ones that were BPA free at the dollar store."
59,5,"1. After using board for 4 weeks, it does NOT have real scratches. Durable.<br />2. Surface is glossy, NO food (particles) stick to the board and NO stains.<br />3. very light.<br />4. good quality, no odor."
60,4,fun straws!
61,5,wow..came quickly..sturdy..easy to use..will buy more as gifts to friends.
62,5,I like'em. These were replacements for the ones I had for ten years and left at a beach rental this summer in Galveston.
63,5,Really good gadget
64,5,"I've got this crazy rotisserie chicken cooker, and it came with maybe ten stretchy chicken tying cords, so I had to find something to tie them with. This twine is the best. I actually prefer it over the stretchy cords I had. And I was concerned that it might have that stance chemical smell some stuff has when it ships, but this didn't, so it's great."
65,4,Perfect for lunch.  I am very happy with this purchase.
66,5,"Everything was just as I expected. Perfect, thanks!"
67,4,"I recieved this for free to give a review. The design is super sleek and nice, but when you use it the metal scraps and makes the most unpleasant sound. I've never had a french press so maybe this is normal. Love using this to make coffee nonetheless"
68,5,"I collect teapots, and I love &#34;The Blue Willow&#34; design by Johnson Brothers.  This teapot is not made in England, but I enjoy it, and I wanted it for my collection.  It is good quality for the money, but not as good as The Staffordshire made in England by Churchill.  I like the unique shape, and it is very pretty.  Also good for everyday use."
69,5,well made  works great for steaming stuff too
70,5,"I received the shipment and am delighted with the shot jars. I think they're great. My plan is to give them to one of my brothers, as a gift. However, I might just have to order him some and have them shipped to him, since he's in another state. Either way, I'm sure I'll be ordering more."
71,4,Works great!
72,5,Very pleased – works just as shown in pictures.  Reviews it in a double loveseat/recliner; stays stable even if one person puts their feet up and the other doesn't.  Holds large glasses very securely. The slot in the middle isn't really so useful for our remote controls;  I would swap the slot in the middle for something that would hold a bowl of pretzels.
73,5,wonderful detailed flower just as the say in size great shipping
74,5,They work so well! Really impressed!
75,5,"OXO always makes good quality products in my opinion, and finally, a can opener that works!  It does what it says, and I've been through so many that haven't.  They are either so cheap they hurt your hands, or they don't cut through the can, or the lid won't stick to the magnet, etc. In this case I can finally say that everything turns smoothly, it cuts the can fine, the arm totally locks onto the lid so you don't need to touch it...and the little release button is easy to use and does what it says."
76,5,Works great. I filled it with ice & water & put it in the sun in 90+ degree heat for 12+ hours & it kept the water cold (33 degrees)! well constructed & not filling the landfill with plastic bottles. I can filter my own water through my frig & have cold water all day. dishwasher safe less poluting & less expensive long term.
77,4,"Great set. Wish lids were glass, too."
78,5,Worked well
79,4,"I like these containers but I have a few small complaints. The sizes are great and the shapes are great, but they aren't totally water tight (with exception of the soup container) so I have to be careful when packing liquids (including canned fruits or veggies.) Also, the containers are microwave safe but they warped slightly and are stained, and I never feel like I can get them cleaned properly."
80,2,The corkscrew is shabby but might work. The stopper is useless - I threw it away 2 minutes after receipt. Not worth returning.
81,1,THESE ARE COUNTERFEITS.  HORRIBLE.
82,5,"Knife sharpener works great. In fact, I am considering ordering more as Christmas gifts. Thanks for offering a product that works."
83,5,I used this bag several times and it held up well. I've also put this bag in my suitcase when I travel and found it convenient to have on hand. I love how it folds up and the cute design!
84,5,What!!!
85,5,"These are just the right size, easy to fill and also pretty!"
86,1,I didn't care for it.
87,5,Works well for its purpose.  Makes me feel like a boss while doing my thing in the kitchen.
88,2,"After I received my order I was disappointed. It is quite simply not worth the $54.00! Be aware that while the shipping was free, the return shipping is subject to the company, as it is not prime eligible."
89,5,Strong and washable!!!!
90,5,Am enjoying using the rocking garlic press. It's easier on my fingers then a knife and can't squeeze the hand held garlic press
91,5,BBQ quick and easy
92,5,This is a phenomenal deal! I love this set! Everything was well made considering how inexpensive it was!
93,5,I received so many compliments on this cake. Used the mold also for Jello great quality
94,5,Only down fall is the handles are plastics otherwise these would be perfect!!!
95,5,It's great. :)
96,5,This little gadget works perfectly! So handy for travel. Great item.
97,5,It is very nice.  I will be using it for my wedding.
98,5,wow.. good looking and good function! not regrettable item!
99,5,Very sturdy compared to others I have used.  Exactly what we expected.
100,5,"Yep, these are the BEST ice cube trays---I love​ them--if I had a bigger freezer I would have more!!!!"
101,4,All good
102,3,Top doesn't ever close correctly
103,5,The forks are great!
104,5,Good solid old time sugar shaker at a good price
105,5,"ohh I love this,I never expect its really cute and it really serve as our lil thank you gift to our guest on our lil one's baptism."
106,5,"Have only used the knife twice thus far, but it has worked perfectly.  My husband is quite pleased with it."
107,5,Awesome ice cream scoop!  Its not like the other scoops where the little metal piece breaks and the ice cream wont come out.  VERY DURABLE and the ice cream comes out every time.  Definitely worth the investment if you are an ice cream eater.
108,3,THIS IS NOT THE ITEM YOU SEE BEING SOLD ON QVC. This is my fault. I only quickly looked at the picture and brand name and just assumed it was the microwave grill that is making the rounds on QVC. It's not. It's just a pot you can cook stuff with in the microwave. It's mostly for stews and soups and other things would cook on the stove top with a pot and cover. The recipe book is limited and is entirely in chinese.
109,5,"Loved these for our wedding dinner, sent all the young kids home with a bag full, lots of smiles!"
110,5,How did I get by so long without this! How nice to not have to scrape the bowl anymore!
111,5,"These glasses feel really substantial, like any glass like this you'd get from a specialty homegoods store."
112,3,I like the size but thought after the first cooking which I did outside because of the oder that it would be improved but it still smell. Hoping it will not always smell like this.
113,1,"This is the 4th whisk we've had to buy. Prongs keep breaking. If we could find another brand that would work, I'd buy it!. Very cheap quality."
114,5,Fiesta is always a winner.  Well made.  Long lasting.  Been using it for years and it still looks great.
115,3,"Keeps can cold as it should.  However, I am very disappointed that it is near impossible to get the can back out of the holder for any reason, whether it be to save what's left for later or to dispose of can.  I tried cans of various  manufacturers, and no difference.  Even crushing the can, as is unavoidable with the tight fit, it is still near impossible to remove.  Even after I cut the side of the holder about 2/3 down, it is still very difficult to dislodge the can.  It is as if one is supposed to throw the holder away with t he can.  I gave three stars as it does keep can contents cold.  But, these holders are not practical if you want to use one more than once easily, or even with more than moderate difficulty."
116,5,Very good product. I love my grilled cheese maker.
117,5,"My wife and I love the coffee press, you do want to purchase a quality coffee to enjoy the full benefits."
118,4,"Great juicer, a bit pricey"
119,5,Works great
120,5,Fantastic product. The machine worked perfectly. The texture of the yogurt was creamy and delicious. I look forward to many batches and experimenting with flavors.
121,5,Easy and fun to use
122,3,"There's an unattractive (but subtle) ring right around the center of the glass. However, it certainly feels like a workhorse. I recommend picking it up at BevMo for $3 instead."
123,5,Works great!
124,4,"Great quality - the bottle opener is heavy, solid metal and definitely looks like a mermaid, but the bottle opener part is a bit dull - it'd be more effective if the lip were slightly bigger."
125,4,The cutting blade doesn't last long and you have to keep buying them to replace it.
126,5,Perfect butter dish.  Couldn't ask for better features.
127,4,"The bowls were great, but one arrived broken.  Not sure it was a great Today's Deal after that."
128,5,I use this for poached eggs and stir fry.  I really like this pan.
129,1,"I purchased the orange squeezer after buying the lemon squeezer and line squeezer manufactured by the same company. New Star Foodservice, and was disappointed with the quality of the orange squeezer.<br /><br />The enamel was flaking off and small pieces of material (perhaps aluminum) were able to be scraped away with my thumbnail."
130,1,"Never stick, don't buy this product"
131,5,"nice water bottle ,can keep warm for a long time!"
132,5,Color was by far the best it's like like a bright pink with a purple twist. The gel was way more bank for the buck then the water based ones like loran
133,5,This packet works awesome for my grandson's camp lunch it keeps everything cold all day
134,4,Works as advertised. Replacing the old Black and Decker under the counter mount can opener from my college days. Takes up less space and can easily hide in a drawer.
135,5,does everything we want
136,5,From now on I'll be taking these with me to the buffet! I think every restaurant should have these. I usually use my fork sideways to open up crab legs. This is so much easier and a lot less mess. They are reusable and dishwasher safe! I received a discount in exchange for my honest review. Great for all crab/seafood lovers!
137,5,"My 5 stars are for both the seller &#34;Dawn's Depot&#34; and the item. I ordered this board in October 2014 and have used it almost daily with much satisfaction. A short time ago I noticed small cracks appearing between the glued sections and contacted Dawn's Depot to complain. Much to my delight, Dawn replaced the cutting board immediately at no cost to me. The new board just arrived and I haven't used it yet but it looks great and I am thoroughly impressed by the courtesy and speed with which Dawn addressed my concerns. If you have any hesitations about the quality of this product, take heart that the seller stands by the product so much so that she did not hesitate to replace it when it appeared I got a dud. I'm hoping to edit this post in the future to say how the new board is doing."
138,5,Works great
139,5,These containers are great! I couldn't be happier with this set and might even purchase another because my roommates keep stealing them =)
140,5,"a good blender from Hamilton that really rips apart everything you put in it, including the competition."
141,5,Love the scale. Came fast as promised.
142,5,"These tasted great and looked great on our Frozen cupcakes! I would highly recommend these, but they will turn your hands blue. They have a great blue raspberry taste. They were just like rock candy."
143,5,I can store eleven knives in this knife block.  It seems well-made and serves my purpose very well.
144,5,Just perfect size mugs.
145,5,cool
146,5,Best juicer in this price range!<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Really quiet when running. Surprisingly silent for its power<br />-Efficient juicing. This juicer has by far  the least discarded fibre. As a result the juice is also full bodied and filling but NEVER too much pulpy. If you want really watery juice you could also strain the juicer with the sieve provided but I dont think its very practical.<br />-Its slow auger presses the juice and extracts the healthy way.<br />-Did I say it is very efficient? It really is!<br />-All parts are dishwasher safe<br />-Been using it atleast thrice a week for nearly 2 years and have never had any problems with it.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Cleaning the filter inside is a pain. It has to be cleaned immediately after juicing or the dried pulp in the tiny holes can be a nightmare.<br />-Chopping all vegetables/fruits small and prepping them to pass through the small feeding tube is a hassle.
147,5,Arrived on time. Met expectations...
148,5,"Fast shipping and a great price.  They are little larger than the ones I was replacing, but they fit fine in fridge. I can't speak to longevity as I've only had them a couple of days, but the price is certainly right if they do have to be replaced."
149,4,Very nice.  Turns lukewarm quickly
150,5,"Love the lemon squeezer, best one ever!!!! Easy to clean and it extracts all the juice with ease."
151,5,Durable abd great food portion control
152,5,Will purchase again in the future if product &#34;wears&#34;
153,4,Works great
154,5,Great product and shipping time!
155,3,I thought it came with a straw<br /> Other than that I like the cup.
156,2,"I purchased this to weigh smokeless powder charges for reloading. The first one I ordered would not hold zero or calibrate so that was an instant return. I ordered another thinking it was fluke.  This scale will not give consistent readings even after a 15 minute warm up. If I remove and replace the included 50g calibration weight it will never give the same reading twice in a row, ever. It's always 5 or 6 hundredths off in either direction depending on what mode you are in. There was no air movement in room and all electronics were off during testing. The metal balance plate popped off as I removed it from the package. You can't see the LCD at an angle but it is big and bright."
157,5,I have a 16 piece setting and love orbit kids have lost mans salad forks so this way was cheaper to replace it! Shipping was fantastic as well as merc!
158,3,Wish they were glass. Very cute.
159,5,Great for keeping your drinks icy cold in the hot weather. They last for hours as opposed to regular ice cubes which melt when it is hot & humid. No more watered down beverages from melted ice when you use these.
160,5,Does everything it promised and more. Made baking a breeze. The cookies slid off. It makes baking easier and more fun. My boys love watching them slide off the mat.
161,3,"I got the black version, but am still very disappointed with Ronco and their customer service, although Amazon was wonderful in addressing those problems. I have had a Ronco for many years and loved it... so easy to use, saves me tons of time in the kitchen, keeps the kitchen cooler during the summer and is such a healthy yet tasty way to cook our meat.  But this newer version is cheaper made, the metal in the baskets is thinner, it makes more noise, and overall I'm a bit non-plussed.  On the brighter side, it cooks hotter and when you turn it off the baskets immediately stop.  If I could afford an expensive one, I would go for it, but this is a very economical way to save you hours of work in the kitchen with great tasting meat  We use it a lot."
162,3,The picture on this is backwards...smh!!
163,1,Broken and did not work.  Sent it back.
164,5,Beautiful and easy to cook with!!
165,2,"The WEMO quit working and they do not have customer service.  When I finally did get someone with the Wemo company by phone, I was told someone would call me back in 45 minutes and no one ever did. The crockpot works fine, but the Wemo app is useless. I paid $125.99 for this and I feel completely ripped off. I work ALOT and this wemo feature is something that was really needed for my busy lifestyle. Save your money and just get a really good crockpot."
166,5,"This bag is great!  I was using cheesecloth to strain my almond milk until I received this bag.  What a time saver!!!  Before, I would need to strain in small batches and also use two additional strainers to get out all the smaller bits.  With this bag, you pour the entire contents of the blender in at once.  The mesh is so fine that there is no need for additional straining.  It has cut my time by 2/3rds.  The clean up is easy and fast too.  I am definitely purchasing more."
167,5,Perfect.....
168,1,I have now had this product one day short of two months and it quit working.
169,5,Beautiful mug.
170,5,"I bought several chocolate molds for my nephew's first birthday cowboy themed party. These were easy to use and easy to pop out once set. These boots are pretty thin so you have to be careful to make sure to fill all of the edges and carefully remove them but they would be easy to use around the side of a cake, on top of it, or as delicious chocolate treats. These were adorable place on top of cupcakes and such an easy solution for a decoration in both white, dark, and milk chocolate. It would have been fun to make them with colored chocolate as well. I will definitely use them again."
171,5,Thank you
172,5,"Love this for my pasta, no slipping, no mess on the stove and table!"
173,5,"I was quite surprised to see all the negative reviews for this brewer.  I really enjoy it!  It has all sorts of neat bells and whistles.  I love to be able to customize settings, so I think it's pretty cool I can pick one of four colors for the light in the water reservoir, and also choose my wallpaper on the very impressive color touchscreen!  I know those two things have little to do with the quality of the brewer, but it's little things like that I appreciate it.  This is my first single cup brewer, and I am NOT a coffee drinker (although my husband is).  I enjoy hot tea, hot chocolate, and iced tea/beverages.  Using this Keurig 2.0 K550 is just too easy.  I typically don't make myself hot chocolate or hot tea because it just takes too long and too much effort in my busy day.  Using this brewer is as simple as popping in your favorite K-Cup, selecting a few options, and hitting a button.  I've only had the brewer for a little over a week now, but I think I've used it almost every day.  I love that the oversized water reservoir holds up to 80 ounces of water, so I don't have to refill it frequently.  I do wish I had the ability to use a reusable K-Cup to make my own tea, but that isn't a deal breaker for me.  Keurig's customer service has been top notch, and I appreciate their knowledgeable, English-speaking representatives.  Overall, I think this is a great machine!<br /><br />Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review!  (Although I received free product for my review, all opinions are my own)."
174,1,Came broken
175,5,Works well and built to last . No more plugged injectors for this guy !
176,5,"got it to replace the same model that the crock cracked. I found it cheaper to buy the whole thing on amazon than to order just the crock plus shipping from the manufacturer... I tested it a few times and I have no idea what the complainers are talking about.  It doesn't heat too high at all.  My carnitas on high were done in 4 hours just as they were in the old one and my pot roast on low was done in 8 hours just as in the old one.  Nothing was over cooked or burned.  It's the perfect size for our two person household to make soups, stews, a small roast and other meats for two dinners for two (one night from the pot and the next night with left overs)"
177,4,"I love the option to brew a carafe and I like the settings on this machine. I did have issues with pods already purchased for an earlier model but since we kept both Keurig machines, I was able to still use them. I do think we need the ability to override the insert option so we can brew ground coffee. In this day and age, you either have a traditional coffee pot or a Keurig, not both. So the option to drink coffee that isn't offered in a pod would be preferable. Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review!"
178,4,"The Keurig K500 is a pretty cool coffee maker. I was never much of a coffee drinker before I got this brewer. I really like how easy it is to make just one cup of coffee when you don't feel like making an entire pot. It's discouraging whenever I have to make a whole pot and then I end up wasting half of it anyway. The large reservoir is perfect for making a lot of cups without having to replace the water all the time, which can be aggravating if you have to do it often. Being limited to Keurig official K Cups isn't a big deal for me since there's always something new and good looking to me. I do not find it to be an issue at all. Besides, if you have old K Cups that won't work in the 2.0 brewer, you can just send them to Keurig and get official ones. This isn't the coffee maker for you if you're trying to make coffee from coffee grounds, just get a regular coffee maker. I do wish that I got dispense more than 6oz. of hot water at a time from the machine because what is 6oz. of hot water going to do for me honestly? Other than that small issue, there's nothing bad to report as of yet. Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review."
179,5,"This kit is great-- it was my first time brewing Kombucha, and I found the directions super easy to follow.  Brewing took me maybe an hour, then I just let it sit for the 7-10 days and it came out great.  I only had one question about what to do with the jar lid (it's basically never used) which The Kombucha Shop responded to quickly.  I'm getting ready to start my second batch now.  Thanks Kombucha Shop for bringing this handy kit to the masses!"
180,3,"Worked great for a few weeks, then it busted around the black parts on the side so I had to toss it"
181,4,"We purchased this unit about a year ago and already had to replace with a new one ( free under warranty) due to a malfunctioning LCD screen. The machine itself is sleek, stylish, and has a huge water reservoir. Also, much quieter then our original Keurig that's still working perfect 8+ years later. My wife loves the fact we can brew full pots of coffee with it as well.  Overall, I would recommend this machine although the LCD screen could be better quality.<br /><br />Thanks, Keurig, for the free pods for this review!"
182,5,"Great for a one year old learning to hold a cup. Even with several drops on a tile floor, no broken glasses yet."
183,1,"After only a few uses, this rice cooker broke mid way through cooking my dinner. VERY disappointed."
184,5,One of the most amazing baking tools I have ever come across. It makes mixing my no knead dough unbelievably fast and effortless. The beauty lies in its simple and solid construction. My kitchen has gained an irreplaceable friend and helping hand!
185,5,I use it all the time and have given some as gifts. It is sturdy and very portable.
186,5,"I just moved out of my parents' house into my own apartment and it only took a week before I was wishing I had a Ninja like theirs. I was so happy to find this set at such a low price! $40 for the motor and three container sizes is a way better price than I could find in any local stores. I use it all the time for smoothies, grinding up cookies/graham crackers for desserts, pretty much anything. It works super fast!<br /><br />One downside for me is that this thing has a lot of little crevices on the lids and the blades that can be a bit of a pain to get clean. It's hard for me to hand wash the blades because they're SO sharp and I am SO clumsy, and my dishwasher sucks."
187,5,Awesome product..
188,4,Just as expected.
189,5,"Very cute product, wife loves them."
190,4,Great product!
191,5,Awesome
192,5,I really and really love my pressure cooker.
193,1,"They only last for 2-3 weeks, then the water starts to smell fishy, disgusting! Had to keep buying them once a month!"
194,4,"Works fine, not sure how long they will last but perfect by the pool."
195,5,"Perfect mold for chocolate hearts. Size is just right, not too big not too small. Good quality silicone. Very flexible, easy to clean."
196,3,More compact but not nearly as good as the full-size spiral slicer.
197,5,"Bought 3 of these to put back for xmas gifts! A wonderful product that I use in our RV as well as home kitchen. In the past I have taken cooked stovetop pasta, drizzled it with olive oil and then freeze for a dish later  (plain with no sauce). I have found though, pasta cooked in the Fasta Pasta does not freeze well. It changes in taste & texture- neither I care for. I don't know why. ..tastes fine freshly cooked or even microwaved the next day...."
198,5,RECEIVED HOURS AGO NO GLUE GLOBS LIKE MANY WRITE HERE.. PERFECT ALL THE WAY NOT LOB-SIDE EITHER VERY WELL MADE LOOKS QUITE ELEGANT  AND DURABLE AND STURDY! I THOUGHT THE PEDASTAL MIGHT BE HIGHER BUT ACTUALLY ITS A RATHER NICE HEIGHT TOO ONCE YOU HAVE A TORTE ON IT.. ETC... LOVELY DEEP COLOR AND NICE DETAIL WORK INTO THE GLASS AS WELL I GIVE IT IT 5  PLUS STARS... VERY NICE
199,5,Easy to use. working good
200,5,We loved the quality of these plates.  Makes a nice way to use paper/plastic.
201,1,They leak :(
202,5,"bought for my grandson who loves it even tho he doesn't drink coffee, he is a camera buff"
203,5,exactly what i expected
204,5,"[[VIDEOID:36075d99432c3ad9554140fe0215bf1a]] For cooking meat, you're just guessing if the meat has been cooked to a sufficiently high internal temperature unless you check it with a probe-type thermometer. I was impressed with the reliability and ease of use of the Kanbrook digital thermometer. I used it to check the internal temperature of stuffed chicken breasts, and it was very close to the temperature measured by another thermometer that I know is accurate.<br /><br />I realized that with the thermometer's range, it was actually measuring the air temperature before I inserted it into the chicken breast. The displayed temperature was within two degrees of the temperature shown on the thermostat located a few feet away just outside the kitchen, which was another way to check the thermometer's accuracy.<br /><br />The product description says that the thermometer has a response time of \\""seconds.\\"" In actual use, I found it could take as long as 30-45 seconds for the thermometer to stabilize. However, for the kind of uses I have for a meat thermometer, that's not much of an issue. In any case, other thermometers that I've used took a similar amount of time to stabilize.<br /><br />The Kanbrook digital thermometer is an excellent thermometer that will earn its keep in any kitchen. I tested it sufficiently to believe that it's accurate enough to rely on for cooking.<br /><br />The thermometer was provided to me for evaluation. I did not promise to post a review, but I stated that if I did review the product, it would be an honest, unbiased review."
205,3,doesn't fit as well as ones that came with the Magic bullet.
206,5,I love my dehydrator!  I keep adding more trays.  Last season I dried 3 bushels of apples in no time.  Just wish it had an on/off switch.
207,5,Works great and love the taste!
208,5,Love these. Perfect for food storage and many other things as well. I will order more.
209,3,Great kitchen gadget.
210,5,These salt and pepper shakers are awesome!  Very easy to use with only one hand.  Sometimes you have to shake them first and then just push down on the tops.  They look great on my countertop and my BF really likes them too!!  A great purchase for me.
211,1,This is my first use and I used the smallest scoop to portion out chocolate chip cookie dough. I literally scooped 10 dough balls and the medal part that is connected to the squeeze handle and rubs against the pole to rotate the scraper popped off. It doesn't look like it was welded well. I only bought these because there are 3 different sizes. Will look for other options
212,5,I just received this cutlery organizer today.  I was surprised at how heavy duty this organizer .  I love how it expands to fill the space in my drawer.  It is perfect for my needs and just what I needed.
213,4,Stylist.  Not too heavy.
214,5,Exactly what I wanted!
215,5,i've used as pressure cooker several times now. It seems very well constructed.  Every meal has been delicious.
216,5,Very nice!
217,5,great exactly what i was looking for!
218,5,"What a great espresso/cappuccino maker. I recently tossed out an old Delongi because of its poor performance. But, this is a whole other story. The creama is good and the froth is great...I don't know what the problem is with the sub-standard reviews. I set the heat to high, two cups, ran a number of plain water brews then used coffee for three more runs, all of which I threw out without trying. Then I ran the first cup to drink. I always use filtered water and Pat's Blend from Green Tree Coffee in Maine then made my favorite (double cap wet),  it is perfect."
219,3,"It's a bit smaller than I thought it would be - meaning that the cookies are extremely small, as well.  But other than that, I quite like the product.  I found cleaning to be easy, as was filling the tube.  Also, I love the handle of this.  My hands didn't ache from fighting to push the plunger, which is a big plus for someone with carpal."
220,5,It is useful as it described.
221,5,Works better than the'70s one with the crank handle it replaced.
222,5,Love it .....and it matchs my kitchen......be careful it's very sharp
223,3,It's ok.  I would like it better if the tabs were staggered rather than all being in the center of the divider card.
224,4,Received the machine today. My husband loved it. Only downfall was that the sample k-cups were expired.... Since April :/
225,4,"I ordered this for my princess party business. I took it to the FedEx store and made more copies of the noses and then laminated the noses and the poster so they would last through more than one party. The kids loved the game (the young kids tried to get it spot on, the older kids tried to get as far off as possible)<br /><br />I agree with some of the other reviews that the packaging is ridiculous. They should not fold the poster. Even after laminating the poster I could still see most of the creases from the manufacturer folding it. But for the price... I am not complaining too much."
226,5,"bought two.  very handy, the caps are interesting, haven't quite decided if they are a plus or minus"
227,5,I ordered 3 of these for my daughters outdoor graduation pizza party to hold all of the toppings.  The night before I chopped and filled the containers and stored the whole units in the ref.  Right before the party I added ice to the bases and put on the table.  The clear lid keeps bugs and dust off the food and the clear container is very attractive.  Got lots of compliments! Love It!!
228,5,They were easy to install and now I can find the spice I need without searching through all of them.  I have more space in the cabinet because the space is used more efficiently.
229,5,Heats water very quickly & easy to use.
230,1,"The lid was difficult to put on once removed. The one time I was able to put it back on the lift lever would not budge, so there is no access to the liquid. I wish I had heeded the negative reviews and saved my money. Very flimsy and poorly made"
231,5,was a little smaller than I had thought but it worked well
232,5,"Purchased this to replace a Screwpull foil cutter and have been very pleased. You might say a foil cutter is a foil cutter, but I honestly believe this is a better execution of the principle than their competition. Just follow their directions and you get a flawless cutting of the foil with no extraneous little pieces of foil. Can very highly recommend."
233,5,A nice looking kettle that heats water rapidly.  Everything a tea drinker could want.
234,5,Perfect size Bunny Rabbit!
235,3,The thing works fine. I have used it on pomegranate as well as citrus<br />I was very disappointed to find it was made in China. They use to be made here dammit.
236,5,"Takes a little practice, but super cool! I recommend separating the yolks and whisking the whites a bit beforehand. Cook some bacon first, then soak the silicone with the grease (flip over in the pan to get both sides), add whites, then yolk last so you can keep it as gooey as you like to dip your toast."
237,5,"This is a great product, a must have for grilling!!  So easy to pick up meat and not use a fork or tongs!  We're very happy with the quality of the pig tail."
238,5,They were super fantastic! Perfect for popcorn look-a-likes.
239,5,Made a nice gift.
240,3,"Fit not good.  Works, but it needs to pressed into the holder to fit."
241,5,Love the different choices that are given and works like a charm
242,5,Best toaster ever.  Prompt service.
243,4,"It's rather large for my Postage-Stamp Kitchen, but I move things out of the room."
244,2,These spoons are cheap in every way.  Thought I was saving money but I ended up having to throw them away.  Very small and bent every time I stirred something.
245,5,Great for parties
246,5,These eggs look real enough to fool the neighborhood raccoons and possums that try to eat my chicken eggs.
247,4,The end of the cup that you use to puncture the eggs with is very dull and brakes the egg instead of puncturing it.  Use a sharp knife ad then the egg cooker works perfectly.
248,4,Its a bit larger than I thought it would be--but otherwise it is great
249,5,Lost this piece during a move and couldn't not find it anywhere in the stores. Now I can use my other attachments again for my KitchenAid!
250,3,"I give these 3 stars because the cubes are a PITA to get out of the mold.  However, here in Arizona your ice melts quickly so having that big solid ice is a great way to go.  I'd recommend these to a friend, but I'd provide the disclaimer that getting your cubes out is a little frustrating."
251,1,Bought this microwave on 12/20/2014 and would not work on 6/1/2015.  Will never buy another Oster brand.
252,5,Bought these as gift and the recipient loved them!  Arrived unbroken and as promised
253,5,Great product.  FAST delivery.  Thanks.
254,5,We bought this for making essence of coffee for Shabbat morning. I used to soak 2 cups of grounds in cold water for several days and then strain the essence through several paper filters. It was time consuming and very messy. Shabbat is several days away but I had to try the press so I made my first cup today and it made excellent coffee from an average grind. The glass seems sturdy and the double filter system keep all the grounds out of my cup. I highly recommend this coffee press. I have no doubt we made the right choice.
255,5,"Alas, this didn't fit my 40+ year old pressure cooker. But the manufacturer gave a complete refund without me having to return it. Can hardly complain about that kind of service."
256,4,Nice product
257,1,Product did not come with try cutlery holder. Disappointed
258,3,"I have both jar sealers (regular-mouth and wide-mouth).  The wide-mouth works great, always seals the first time.  The regular-mouth doesn't work near as well.  The blue piece of rubber always comes out when you attempt to seal the jar."
259,5,"Awesome drawer.  Works perfectly to raise my new Keurig 2.0 high enough to fit my favorite coffee mugs underneath, and hold all my favorite coffee right there. And even with the Keurig2.0 pulled forward, it is rock solid.  I love my new drawer. It is perfect."
260,5,"Beautiful bottles, work well with my vanilla making!"
261,1,broke before I got it
262,4,Like the pan. So far so good.  Got tired of shipping their hard coat anodize pans back. Always wore out. Life time warrantee was nice but every other year taking up to three weeks to get it back?  Decided to go stainless.
263,5,"MUCH better than my previous cast iron nightmare!  Grills beautifully, cleans VERY easily, and looks brand new after many uses.  A winner!....  And now, after many months, it still looks brand new despite many uses!"
264,4,Nice I just like it
265,5,"Makes my kimchi taste that much better, great product."
266,5,Came just as promised. Work great.
267,5,Excellent product
268,5,"Excellent strainer, it doesn't leave any residue."
269,2,"I guess if you like weak tasting coffee, then you'll love this machine.  Personally, I like my coffee strong and that's difficult to accomplish with this machine.  If you want a strong cup of joe using K-cups with this machine, then you need use them at a ratio of 1 K-cup to 6oz of water.  Unfortunately, this machine's lowest marking is for 8oz, forcing you to break out measuring cup to fill the reservoir with 6 oz.  The same applies to the grounds filter - it's only good for 6-8oz.  Since most travel mugs are ~12-14oz, that means you have go thru the whole process twice every morning to fill you mug.  Overall, I'm pretty disappointed with this machine.  The Kuerigs seem to produce better and more consistent results."
270,4,Plastic and cheap feeling but looks great. Will work for what I wanted.
271,5,"Pan is super heavy, but will give you those cool grill lines when you cook steaks. Cast iron can be hard to clean, so get the cleaning chain or steel wool and scrub hard."
272,4,"Not the grade A quality. However, given the price and its beauty, you can not miss it."
273,4,"Performs as advertised. Sharp blade, exactly what you need for slicing. should rinse the unit right away to avoid those bits and pieces sticking in the nooks and crannies. The holder is a bit cumbersome and the board could stand to be a half inch  wider but its stores easy and makes salad prep quick. fast shipping"
274,4,We are enjoying using this with our red wines.  I notice an increase in the smoothness of the wine.  I want to do more blind taste tests to really savor the difference
275,5,"I have this pot for many years now and have given many as gifts. For those of you having trouble with &#34;lid locking&#34;, place the pot horizontally on the stove. Then place the lid vertically on the pot (opposite way) and turn it to the left until it stops at the handles. Not hard to do. Love this pot!!"
276,4,"It's ok. Bought this as replacement for a corporate rental I utilized. Honestly, I don't think the quality is that high and I wouldn't buy it for myself. It's hard to clean and doesn't last... But it served its function, and I am glad it was on prime. It's a good looking unit for superficial minds that don't want to dig any deeper to find something that'll last beyond a month."
277,5,"love it for quick breakfast. We try with thin bagel and english muffins with bacon, sausage, etc. Always good. Timer really helps."
278,4,"I found that these coasters not only stuck to the table top very well but they were also very easy to clean. I have a small child at home and he made a mess of the coasters early on. I think that the coasters are a bit larger than they need to be, but I would recommend these to anyone looking for great coasters as they are fairly cheap compared to other coasters."
279,5,Beautifully made...I am so happy!
280,1,Not as pictured.  Not worth the price.
281,5,just what we needed.  would like a smaller version too.
282,5,Very nice bought for my son he makes rice meals all the time!
283,5,You can't go wrong with this for the price.  I needed something that fit in a tight spot and this did the trick.  It looks nice and is sturdy.
284,2,"The design starts to come off while washing. We washed ours 3 times, and the design started coming off and staining our hands."
285,5,Excellent craftsmanship and very easy to carry around.
286,5,Best microwave egg poacher I've ever had. Mine cooks two eggs perfectly in 2.05 minutes at half power.
287,5,"The action is smooth, adjustments are easy, style is clean, and material and workmanship are top notch.  I've gone through tons of these trying to find the ideal unit, and I think this is it!"
288,4,big and beautiful but one is broken. I'm using only one.
289,5,Good stuff
290,1,Flimsy and thin.
291,3,Cannot really see the shape on the egg..
292,5,Great product!
293,5,"Perfect size, removable plates make it easier to clean."
294,5,"We've been creating all kinds of delicious healthy frozen treats since receiving these.  The possibilities are limitless!  When my 7 year old reaches for these in the freezer, I always say yes.  We puree a variety of organic fruits (and I've even hidden a few veggies in the puree) fill and freeze.  It's that simple.  They also clean easily and effortlessly.  Great popsicle molds!"
295,5,This Spanish bread knife is terrific.  It is the perfect size for cutting bread.  I used it even on hot bread I make.  Slices through without any effort.  The price was very reasonable for a quality knife.
296,5,"These are my go-to for my Foodsaver Seal a Meal. I use my bag sealer for freezing food ingredients, whole meals, lunches, medicines, first aid, important documents, and small amounts of personal items such as soaps and meds for lightweight travel. I also use seal items to keep dry while camping. I've even sealed up emergency cash for tiny hidey spots. i have saved money by throwing away less food by sealing and/or freezing.<br />These are cheaper by the foot then other brands, and according to the website, is BPH free. These are safe to simmer and microwave food in. Be careful, other brands are NOT safe for simmering or microwaving.<br />Personal recommendations: freeze small portions for lunches for weeks at a time. bags can be microwaved even while still frozen. Be sure to poke a small hole in the bag.<br />If freezing foods you don't want too smooshed, freeze food on a plate for 30 minutes, then vac. Or, seal without vacuuming. If sealing things like liquid soap or pills, just seal the bag. Vacuuming will make a huge mess, or eventually crush the pills. Definitely do NOT vacuum gel tabs or fluid filled pills. Also do not vacuum first aid gauze pads or feminine products, just seal. These things will crush too much under vacuum.<br />Frozen meat or food can be defrosted in the bag, float in a pan of water on low heat.<br />While camping, i'll boil a bag in water to thoroughly heat the contents without dirtying a pan.  Tip: snip a tiny slit in the edge of the bag so you can tear open the bag eaasily, not have to cut it. Also, we have used a hair flat iron for sealing which is useful if you don't need a vacuum feature."
297,4,"This kitchen timer works as well as I could have hoped.  It has a big display so that even if I am across the room I can read the remaining time.  I need it mainly for cooking meat, rice and anything else that needs timing.  For that it is great.  Its maximum time is 99 minutes, but I can't think of anything that you have to time that is longer than that!<br />The only thing that I would like is a way to adjust the sound.  To my ear its very loud."
298,5,"Works well, use it couple times a day, every day."
299,5,"Just as expected and a great value.The wine-lover boss of mine really liked this. She is the type that opens up a bottle of wine at every dinner, and when I gave it to her as a gift, she was extremely excited.It keeps the wine chilled even before finishing the whole bottle. Perfect to add to a gift basket for the wine drinker in your family too.I'm thinking of buying another one to give to my father in law for Father's day!"
300,5,"For the price, it's one of the best hand blenders.  Lots of power, more than the ones that cost twice."
301,5,I love this idea
302,5,My husband was delighted with the size
303,5,"Already used it several times. Great quality, bakes and browns evenly, cleans up quickly."
304,5,So far we love these
305,5,works great -- nothing has stuck to it or stained it so far and it comes out of the dishwasher looking like new. been in use a couple of months and i've used it probably a dozen times.
306,2,"I wanted a mincer that could help me slice up herbs finer than I could do so with a knife.  I was considering a herb scissors or this, and thought that it would be easier to roll over and mince multiple times rather than cut.<br /><br />For me I like my herbs chopped or sliced-up fine - and with this it just takes way too much effort having to use this like a roller on dough multiple times.<br /><br />Have to say after two uses, I have shelved this because:<br /><br />1.  the blades too far apart<br /><br />2.  the blades not sharp enough to cut through coriander, mint, basil etc<br /><br />3.  it mashes most leafy herbs due to its blunt blades<br /><br />I really should have read more reviews before making this purchase."
307,4,"Nice blender. Worth a hundred bucks? I suppose so if it lasts. All the immersion blenders I have owned so far have suffered stripped drive gears in a couple months of use from making my daily protein/frozen berry smoothies. The one the Breville is replacing, a Kitchen Aid, has been operating on JB Weld repaired gears for a couple of years now. That's been fine I guess, but it means that the blender attachment has not been removable and the other attachments have been unusable. Also with the Breville, there is a soft rubber part on the motor housing that is ill-fitting, not worth sending it back for but I do hope that the internals were assembled with more care."
308,4,Good bargin
309,5,I use this every day and I think it is good. I really wanted a red toaster
310,5,Expensive but best for summer months to help lose weight. Makes co-workers jealous to see me eat salad out of a very organized box. Easy to clean and maintain. Strong structure.
311,5,"This is a neat gadget to have around the kitchen. First off it is super simple to assemble. It is also very easy to use. Lasty it is easy to clean. All three very important factors to any gadget in the kitchen.<br /><br />Assembly is only 3 pieces. You have the corer tube, the plastic wedger, and the handle. The platic wedger goes around the coring tool. Then the handle attaches to the top of the coring tube. It clicks into place with 2 pop out keepers inside the coring tube. To release the handle all you have to do is press in those 2 tabs and pull it apart.<br /><br />Now you will need to prepare your pineapple for the corer. This is very simple. All it requires is cutting off the top of the pineapple and the base of the pineapple. This will also help with the coring since the pineapple will be setting flush to the cutting board. From there you line up the coring tube with the core and start cutting and turning it to the bottom.<br /><br />Next is to figure out if you are using the wedger or not. Now you need to decide how you want the pineapple cut. If you want wedges then use the yellow plastic wedge tool once you have it cored. Grab the long side tabs of the wedge tool and push it down the coring tube. That is how you make wedges. Now if you want to do whole circle pieces, use the corer as before but do not use the wedger on top of it. Take the pineapple off of the corer, it is a long round connected piece from top to bottom of the corer. Now to make the full circles cut the pineapple down one side and then sperate. If you want half circle cuts you can simple cut the pineapple in half from the top to the bottom and it will make your half circle cuts.<br /><br />Cleaning is a piece of cake with this tool. The hardest part is getting the core out of the tube. It is a very snug fit in there but does push out really easy with my wooden spoon handle. From there it is a simple wash and dry in warm soapy water.<br /><br />If you are in the market for a new kitchen gadget to help with desings and making life with pineapple a breeze, you can simple not go wrong with this pineapple corer. I would like to thank Ali Jane and affiliates for sending me this pineapple corer to try out and leave my opinion.<br /><br />Disclosure of Material Connection: I received a sample for free in the hope that I would mention it on my blog. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I tried personally and believe will be good for my readers. No other form of compensation was received.

312,5,great
313,5,Great kettle.
314,4,Great product.
315,5,works well as a travel thermos not intended to make it more than a few hours.  works well cold or hot.
316,5,Excellent product for the money. Easy to use and small and compact for easy storage. Solid construction. I highly recommend it.
317,5,"This rack is perfect to store all kinds of bakeware, trays and big dishes. There are 22 holes in the base (per side) to put the dividers: there are about 6 mm or 1/4&#34; between holes. This makes the rack very flexible, as good to store thin baking trays as to store thick 2.5&#34; or 3&#34; glass dish."
318,5,Cute! Made in China. The material and detail are not exactly what I had expected for Alessi 's reputation. But does appear to be well made.
319,5,"Love it, Thanks!"
320,5,Great solution...cleans like a charm....
321,5,"Great product.  Easy to store, love the color and just the right size."
322,1,"Came with a chip in the first one I open, notice it was very thin. So I sent all back, the rest still wrapped.. Found nice ones on chef's . com (8 for $39).<br />Hope this helps.<br />Chef Dan"
323,5,"I just completed a new oak cutting board.  Investigating the best way to condition it, I came across John Taylor Butcher Block Conditioner Food.  The product came in the mail promptly.  I followed the simple directions, and couldn't happier with the results.  The board glows in our kitchen and has a wonderful surface on which to work.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this product to anyone who might inquire."
324,1,"This came chipped and with smudged letters. While the idea was cute, the product is cheap."
325,5,This is a really nice looking cutting board. Cleans easily and has a tight grain that doesn't feel rough when wiping down with a sponge or paper towels. Found out it can be stained by things like Turmeric.
326,5,perfect for my herb teas mix of 2 lb of mint  2 lb of sassafras  & 2 lb of clove
327,5,Just as advertised. Stylish modern spoon rest for your kitchen.
328,5,GREAT!
329,4,"They are everywhere on the field and make the squeeze easy. Great durability and cheap price. Probably one of the better sports bottles for taste of the bottle effecting your drink, but you can still taste it especially if the drink isn't cold anymore."
330,2,"we actually returned it. We thought there were two settings, cold and hot but only one when we made it. Even if you fill the milk to the lowest line, the milk would overflow and we would lose most of the milk."
331,5,Works great.  Makes a party size of popcorn. Love the color.
332,5,Used these to make Bunny feet out of fondant for cake pops it worked great ! This product is made well and worked for what I was looking to use it for!
333,3,"I truly can't figure out the rave reviews. The can opener is comfortable, seems durable, and was made in the U.S.A., so I generously gave it three stars. However, one small problem:  It doesn't open cans very well. Most of the time it leaves at least one &#34;uncut&#34; area; sometimes more than one. When I buy a can opener, I kind of expect it to open cans the first time, every time. I'll keep looking."
334,5,I will forever love these! I bought them for two of my friends that love turtles and they both adore them so much!
335,1,"This cup advertises that it keeps hot drinks hot for 6 hours.  I poured a cup of coffee, took a few sips and walked away to do something.  When I came back 40 minutes later, the coffee was already cold."
336,5,We have two. One for my 12 yr old daughter and I use the other. Great for me for portion control. My daughter loves here too. These are awesome!
337,3,"I had to send them back.  However, they were attractive and had some heft to them so they did not feel cheap."
338,5,I love glass storage containers.  These are the Pyrex that you can trust.  The different colored lids are fun.  Use then all the time.<br />Much nicer than plastic stuff.  Don't stain or retain smells.
339,5,"This is a nice large tray, good for the couch people, This tray is heavy you will like it.  I paid $ 5.09 for mine<br />then the went up, watch the price and you will love them.  They are great for a tea service or for cheese and wine.<br />Took a long time and looking to find an  eco tray.  Don't like it send it back."
340,5,"good, better than a wooden one i had."
341,5,This filter worked out just fine.
342,5,High quality
343,5,"These are a little smaller than I had anticipated, but that is because I really wasn't paying attention to size as I purchased them. Truth be told, they are exactly what I needed. They are super sturdy and super easy to clean. I would buy these again if I needed more."
344,5,This product is really a useful item.I have used it to measure temperatures of about everything.From metal to plastics to liquids.<br />Really a good product.
345,5,"Works great, used it a bunch already over 2 months and no problems what so ever. It's nice not to constantly have to put water in it"
346,5,Perfect for the shower
347,5,As described. What more can you ask for?
348,5,"I bought this at my local supercenter, but love it so much, I thought I would review it on here.  It is great!  We had been eating micro popcorn, then read about how unhealthy it was for you with all the additives, so then we were doing stove top popcorn, which was yummy, but took oil to cook and seemed too fattening.  So, found this little popper and I was in love. If you let it run for 2 minutes as suggested to get hot, then add popcorn, it's really quite fast. Not much waste at all. I would say with 1/2 cup kernels, we have maybe 5-10 kernels left.  No oil needed, you can eat it straight from the bowl it pops into. For a rare treat, I transfer to another bowl, salt and drizzle with a few TB of melted butter. It is divine. Good crisp popcorn, quick and relatively healthy.  I just take a damp paper towel and wipe it down when done, then the actual &#34;motor&#34; fits down inside the bowl for easy storage.  My family of 5 loves this!!"
349,5,the can opener goes well with everything in my kitchen and yes it works very well
350,4,"Works pretty easily but you have to keep an eye on it to be sure not to overcook the bread.. it does not shut off automatillay so you have to unplug it when finished. no big deal.  If you use cold meat, it may cool the egg cooking plate,  so I preheat my meat in the microwave while this machine is warming, up then load the machine and the egg cooks before the bread gets to dark.  One time I used a big piece of cold meat and the egg  was a bit runny while the buns were getting pretty dark.. problem easily solved by preheating the meat.  Best when using fresh farm eggs!"
351,3,"They don't seem like the best quality, but they do what they need to do."
352,5,These filters do a great job.  Our city water has been transformed into great tasting water.
353,3,"Not gonna lie I was disappointed in the difficulty to use, it was difficult not to get the water to freeze the ice balls together. But over all ok."
354,1,I got a empty box with no grinder in it wtf kinda s*** is that
355,5,These fiesta bowls make great cat dishes. They are virtually unbreakable and usually the same price or less than your typical poor quality &#34;cat dishes&#34;.<br />I have been using these for a couple years and all are still in perfect condition. Wash by hand or dishwasher.
356,5,Really nice & keeps ice well.
357,3,"Not quite as awesome as it's predecessor that did not come apart. Still decent, but the grip is thinner, so they cut into my fingers more when I'm doing lots of cutting."
358,4,"We used this guy to slice fruits to make things like apple chips and sweet potato chips. Blades are super sharp (cut through apple seeds) and the setup is easy. Comes with multiple blades for many other functions. However, I would suggest them to increase the width of the slicer to allow larger items to be sliced!"
359,5,Elegant and convenient 👍
360,5,"I'm in Love with my Breville. It's so easy to use!.<br />What I like about is I bake sweet potatoes everyday for my carb needs, and other ovens I need to flip the sweet potatoes a couple times every 20 minutes or so not to get burnt on one side. But this Breville doesn't need that, it cooks evenly on all sides without touching it, and it cooks sweet potatoes like no other. I set temp to 380, set it to 1 hour, and that's it. I don't need to check it or look at it. After its done, its just perfect!<br />Oh and the Toast, it's easier than one of those pop up toasters. Dial the setting knob to toast then press start and that's it. Perfect Toast Every single time.<br />This thing makes perfect Toasters Strudel for my Kids every morning.<br />I love this. I don't think I can live without it anymore. So Spoiled by the Breville.<br />Amazing Product, Absolutely the best oven in the world period."
361,5,"We are using it as a pizza dough mat. We love that the dough doesn't require extra flour. It doesn't stick at all! YAY! Since we always make huge pizzas, we needed a extra large mat. This was the largest one we could find. Because it is large,  it is a little awkward to clean, but not bad, cleans up real fast."
362,5,Perfect for small plates and appetizers.  Have purchased several times.
363,5,"STUNNING, ATTRACTIVE. SOLID / STURDY ! LEO the LION! Ya cant go wrong with a wine glass this size. Its just impressive. The  SANDBLAST ETCH is perfectly designed without flaws. Well crafted..<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price or the item was supplied to me in exchange for the purposes of a product review. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest & unbiased opinion"
364,5,"Item is as described, adhesive works perfectly. It looks well made and it's a nice touch on a gift wrap."
365,5,Amazing knives at a great price! You can't so wrong with this set. They are high quality and made from one solid piece of metal with the rubber grip over it. Super sharp!
366,5,sweet
367,5,very versitile
368,5,works great
369,4,Seems to be a good quality bag.
370,4,good
371,5,"Nice product, good quality!"
372,5,I have this in the house and in the RV!
373,5,"Very nice product, my grand daughter will love it on her birthday cake."
374,5,Love these mats! They clean up so easy and are really durable.
375,5,"These  were perfect, replaced my lids which had worn out."
376,4,I was pleasantly surprised as the quality is much better than I anticipated. As many other reviews mention the back side isn't the shiny silver but they still are in fact silver just a little more dull. Not as noticeable as I was expecting. That's the only thing I would recommend on changing but as I mentioned before they still look great overall. These will make a great addition to our big event coming up.<br />Highly recommend this disposable flatware set for anyone wanting somewhat realistic looking flatware but that are disposable. For what you pay this is a great buy.
377,5,"Better than expected and so convenient for daytime lunches (for hubby, and for kids if we had kids!), and great for leftovers.  I also  use them to store daily lunch meats and sliced cheese, and I use them to precut and store onions, lettuce, tomatoes.  I just love these and will be buying more!"
378,5,Works well for tea or coffee.  Cold brewed only way to go
379,5,Perfect for my sons carnival bday party!
380,5,Great stainless fry pan. Easy purchase experience.
381,5,Works great!
382,5,"I was looking for a decent napkin holder for a while. Decided on this because of the matching salt & pepper shaker holder. They go together well. The napkin holder has s flap to keep napkins from blowing which is nice. The holder feels solid and heavy. Definitely doesn't feel or look cheap. The napkins don't fit perfectly(the holder is a bit larger than standard napkin size), however I imagine the fancy party napkins would fit in the holder which is nice."
383,5,"I will  order again to give out gifts for family friend to use, it cost saving in buy your own coffee and easy to clean up after.<br />from John Bradford"
384,5,just the right of egg holder for a small gathering.  5 eggs
385,5,All Good.
386,5,My old filter broke after 3 years of daily use. Love the product.
387,1,"I received one of these as a gift from a coworker.  The lid does not snap on tight, has no seal on the inside causing it to leak.  I burned my hand the first time I used it from the hot coffee leaking from under the lid."
388,3,"It's pretty, but doesn't work as well I hoped.  It's a bit wobbly and isn't very operable with one hand."
389,5,LOVE!
390,5,"This is perfect for one cup of French press coffee. Plus it's a fun color. I'm no connoisseur, but this meets my needs for a special cup of coffee to treat myself."
391,5,Amazing but bigger then expected
392,2,It didn't fit and I had too modify the top to make it work. I do not recommend this item for my Mr.coffee.
393,1,"You get what you pay for,<br />normally I am positive but it's hard to be w/this one.<br />Barley stands on its own even w/water<br />back board fell off once and never Could get the card board back board back on the mount, it just frayed and split.also the vertical piping is barley strong enough to hold it's own weight.<br />however it was delivered when we expect to get it."
394,5,I have received this product without charge/discounted price to give my honest opinion on it these that are expressed are my own. I love the quality of this. It's heavy though which is fine with me because I know it's good would def recremend this friends and family!
395,5,Received right on time...will be making something on it tomorrow. Can't wait to try it.
396,5,aaaaaaaa
397,5,"I got this for my daughters birthday.She said it arrived well packaged. It was sturdy,shiny and whirled like a dream.She couldn't wait to put her k-cups in it! Very nice product!"
398,4,Now we know where the concept for the Star Trek Enterprise came from...and the phaser if you turn it upside down and remove the &#34;saucer&#34;.<br /><br />My husband wanted a metal meat grinder attachment for the Kitchenaid standmixer and this fits the bill.  We haven't used it yet but it seems sturdy and well made.
399,5,I Love it !!  It is textured and a little hefty so it is no slip plus no knife marks or cuts no matter what I'm chopping or slicing.  It folds easily for dumping chopped vegetables or whatever into pan.  Cleaning is a breeze.  The color is a beautiful bright blue but I would love to have a choice in colors.....just to match my kitchen decor.......red would be striking !!  I am hoping this lasts a long time as I am really enjoying using it.
400,5,Love these dishes
401,5,"The spiralizer is a handy and fun tool to inspire healthy eating.  Zucchini noodles are so much healthier than white pasta!  It is very easy to use, The little blades are very sharp and cut easily.  I was a little skeptical about quality<br />until I ordered it and tried it!!  Now I am very happy I got it!"
402,4,Good quality !
403,2,"the writing, measurement numbers, are coming off after being washed."
404,5,"Great opener. Cuts through like a hot knife through lard. Because of that, it's very easy to turn the knob. No fighting. And it stays clamped to the can until you let go of the grip. Replaced that cheapo made-in-China junk that I should have never bought."
405,4,Works and looks as promised.  Only reason not giving 5 stars is it seems it heats up more quickly or slowly based on how magnetic the cookware you are using is.  I guess if I had a complete set of one manufactures  cookware I would have no complaints.
406,2,Did not live up to expectations
407,2,"I should have read the reviews closer before purchasing. Just as the other reviews say, it cooks way too hot. So low cooks like high. And it ends up ruining some recipes and/or you have to babysit it, which defeats the purpose of a crockpot."
408,5,Juicer is on point. Makes mad yummy juice. Get juicer.
409,5,works well one sheet at a time
410,5,It's a great grinder for a great price. The removable cup is a perfect innovation for coffee grinders. I mostly use it to grind spices.
411,5,The right size for holding about 4 lb. rice.
412,5,Better than the original that came with my press!
413,5,"So this thing is a little bit awesome! I really enjoy using it and enjoy the effect it has on the wine. It's really does seem to slightly mellow the wine which is especially nice if you're using cheap wine (which I was when I tested this). It's almost like you're pouring your wine into a tiny wine glass with a hollow stem (the practical shape of the inside of this aerator) and as it passes through the stem two slightly angled holes cutting into the &#34;stem&#34; and the trick of the gravity sucking it down creates a kind of vacuum sucking air into the wine through the angled holes as it descends down the stem and into your actual wine glass. That air being sucked into the wine also creates a rather satisfying bubbling/gurgling noise. The whole thing is really well made too with very thick/heavy clear acrylic and a nice rubber base for it to sit in when not in use. Just remember to rinse it out once the wine fun is over. I assume the small mesh filter at the top is there to catch any stray bits of cork and/or help prevent splashover. It really does quickly and easily aerate the wine and does it with flair and without batteries! It also comes very well packaged in what has to be described as a 'gift' box... very thick and well designed including the internal packaging. I was given the chance to buy this at a discount with a request for my honest review here... I was happy to buy and try it but honestly surprised at how *much* I liked it. Especially given the overall niceness of the item and the gift box it came in, I kind of felt like I shouldn't be keeping this for myself (but I will). I think I'll have to buy another one pretty soon as an actual gift for one of my wine-loving relatives. This thing rocks!"
414,5,This is the second one we have.  So easy to use & keeps the drips off the counter!
415,5,"Wish Amazon.com would keep these Crayola lunch boxes in stock year round.  This makes the perfect little case to hold Crayola crayons or markers for me.  Or I can use it for holding my ten pairs of Pro Color Therapy glasses which are really helping heal my eyes from the glare on my screen on my computer.  The Baker-Miller Pink glasses are very helpful for computer glare.  This case is a very sturdy canvas, not metal, lunch box with a strong zipper around the top part of it.  The colors are rich looking, and the handle is very sturdy and strong.<br />I am sure you could think of a lot of things to use it for besides a lunch box, too.  I am very happy with this purchase.  I would like to buy several more of them that are new.  Thank you to the two sellers, Toys-Go-Round and Bugaboos, for a great product that I am very happy with buying three of these lunch boxes thus far."
416,5,One of my Favorite mats! They are durable and very strong. Love the three sizes!
417,5,good
418,5,Keeps my tea warm ALL day! Impressive.
419,5,The blade is new and has the date of manufacture on the box . Be carefull installing very sharp good deal for what your vitamix can do.
420,5,"I really like this timer.....big numbers and nice having options of being able to have magnetic.... for us, the only thing that was frustrating was the adhesive tag on the back (maybe was Amazon&#34;s ? which was stuck on the back and covered the instructions of procedure of settings).<br /> When I tried to remove it, it would not come off,  just left  gooey mess and made it  instructions totally unreadable.  So,  this negative is probably an issue more for Amazon  than with wrenware .... Perhaps wrenware should be aware of how Amazon places their small shipping tags to the back of items to be mailed."
421,5,Just what I wanted.  :)
422,5,Bought this for a friend ...... She loves it.
423,3,"It's cute, but in now way will hold a 9x13 pan like I intended.  I would not purchase again."
424,5,It is great!
425,5,They are lovely.  Heavy and attractive with simple lines. I am delighted!!!
426,5,Perfect
427,5,great cups now I know why they were recommended.
428,5,Love it
429,5,Works great.
430,4,"A little small, but still a good product."
431,1,"Didn't work right, gave it away."
432,5,Bought set for my little old lady friend that had gotten cleaned out.  She was delighted with the set.  :)
433,5,"I am using even private also to work.<br />Reputation from friends well, I am very satisfied.<br />I am very satisfied with this product."
434,5,Exceptional. I simply cannot praise these enough.
435,5,"We've used a bunch of times now.  The price was good and it makes quite a bit of popcorn at a time.  Seems like it will last a while. We bought for my sons birthday party with about 50 people to make for.  Took about 3 batches but worked out great.  I was hoping to use this outside for our outdoor movies at night but the light from the machine attracts all the bugs in Hawaii so we had to make indoors and bring out....no biggie, we still love.  Cleaning can be a bit annoying but I imagine most would be this way."
436,4,"Very nice.  A bit expensive, but I was not let down by the quality of the plate or the etched graphic."
437,1,"This is a terrible product. It is typical of the crap made in China. Very thin metal with sharp, dangerous edges. Do not buy this."
438,5,Does exactly as intended and shredded those zucchini in a most spiraly fashion. It was glorious.
439,4,easy to use and it works
440,5,Absolutely loved it. Small and cute looking. Works great and cleans fast.
441,1,Disappointed with this product. Fell apart within one month of purchase.
442,5,Perfect
443,5,Item received same day as promised. Definitely recommend..
444,5,"Nice product, fast delivery"
445,5,"These are good-sized bags (a bit bigger than the ones that grocery stores provide), so they wrap around trashcans very nicely."
446,5,I received it very quickly and I love it.
447,5,Cute
448,5,Very fun set - they make me smile!
449,4,I find it absolutely amazing that three glasses arrived unharmed and in perfect condition yet one stone out of 9the was cracked in half.
450,5,We love our soda stream!
451,1,"Yes. These filters do not last half as long as those purchased elsewhere. The last filter out of the 4-pack I recently purchased was supposed to last until May 7th, yet here it is March 21st and it appears exhausted. I usually don't put the &#34;Life Calendar&#34; sticker on my water pitcher because it is obvious when a filter runs its course. But, since the first three filters seemed to wear out so fast, I decided to pay closer attention. This filter lasted two weeks! We are a two-person household and use two other filtered water sources so there is no reason these should filters should wear out so fast. I won't purchase these again."
452,5,"I have another stick blender I use for food, and I bought this one for making soap.  After you combine the lye water and the fat/oil mixtures you have to stir until it comes to &#34;trace&#34;.  Using a stick blender speeds up the process and makes it a lot less work.  I followed the advice of others and stir with it on for several seconds and then stir with it off for several seconds.  Alternating on/off will help avoid burning up the motor, as these things aren't made to blend thick hot liquid for 10-15 minutes straight, they were designed to quickly blend food."
453,5,Definitely worth the investment.
454,5,very happy with this purchase!
455,4,"High quality, easy to fill, sturdy brush.  As these things go, this model is a good one.  However, it is too easy to over-dispense the soap, which then requires frequent re-filling as the reservoir is small.  I realize that a larger capacity might make it unwieldy."
456,1,They are way bigger than the picture shows. They are bulky on the cupcakes. If you try to return them you are charged either 6.54 or over $12 to return them. They cost $6 to start with
457,5,very good~
458,5,Works as advertised. I'm pleased
459,5,This was to replace my old 20 year old molded one. Works great  just like my old one.
460,5,"I’ve been scared of stainless steel cookware for years. I was so convinced that cleaning would be hard and food would be stuck everywhere so I had been using Teflon coated pans for the last twenty years. But if you have Teflon pans you know over time they can warp and the Teflon starts to peel off. My husband really wanted a set of nice looking pans (he is such a boy and what is better looking than stainless steel) so we started to research.<br />I purchased the Cuisinart MCP-12N Multiclad Pro Stainless Steel 12-Piece Cookware Set and it is fantastic.  However the 8” skillet just isn’t quite big enough for some of my cooking needs.  This 12” skillet is great as it matches the set I purchased and has exactly the same upkeep needs as my full set.<br /><br />We decided to go with the Cuisinart MCP-12N Multiclad Pro for a few reasons.<br /><br />1. It has the Tri-ply 18/10 stainless steel with the aluminum core.<br /><br />This was important to us because we wanted something that would last forever. I don’t want to have to buy pots and pans again and so I’m willing to spend a little more money on a nice set instead of purchasing a new Teflon pan every 4-5 years.<br /><br />From everything we researched you want at least the 18/10 and three layers for heat distribution and even cooking.<br /><br />2. We couldn’t beat the price for a set of this caliber and it was rated top for the price in two different magazines. I believe Better Home and Gardens was one of them the other was http://www.allcookwarefind.com/Stainless-Steel<br /><br />We researched and this set was less money than the All Clad and Calphalon cookware with similar ratings and materials.<br /><br />3. Everything in the set could be placed in the oven.<br /><br />This is a nice feature. The handles are sturdy and made of the same stainless steel. They can be put in the over up to 500 degrees. I never thought I needed this function until I started cooking roasts and chicken in iron skillets it is great to be able to cook everything in one pan.<br /><br />4. There were extra matching pieces available to add to our set later.<br /><br />Now I have almost everything I need and still have the option of adding a 5 ½ quart sauce pan, dutch oven or a another pieces at a later date without breaking the bank.<br /><br />FYI:<br /><br />We went through about a dozen different youtube videos and found a few useful tidbits if this is your first stainless steel set.<br /><br />- ALWAYS season the pan prior to the first use or after a heavy cleaning. This is easy enough and there are thousands of videos on how to do it. We preheated the pan and added coconut oil. Turn the heat up a little and let the oil heat until smoking. Pour off the excess and then gently wipe with a paper towel and let cool. If done correctly you can even cook eggs on your pan without any sticking.<br />- ALWAYS preheat the pan before cooking. This will minimize the any sticking and will help the heat distribution.<br />- NEVER wash with dish soap. This will remove any seasoning you have done to the pan. When you are done cooking let the pan cool (DO NOT PUT FROM STOVE DIRECTLY INTO WATER this may warp the pan) then with a spatula or wooden spoon run any excess material off the bottom. If there is any stubborn residue you can add a little warm water or oil…heat until warm and then gently rub the material off.<br />- GET Barkeepers Friend. This is a great way to restore your stainless steel to looking brand new.ble to cook everything in one pan.<br /><br />4.

461,4,We had an Old Hollywood Glam/Red Carpet themed birthday party for my Grandma and I ordered these wrappers for the popcorn style cupcakes. They were so cute! I wish they were a tiny bit longer but I think my cup cakes were a little larger than normal but I did have to use tape to secure them which I planned on doing anyway for added security. I would definitely recommend these and I think the price is pretty good too :) So glad I found these!
462,5,It looks fabulous but I havent used it yet.  It's heavy as expected since its cast iron.  I love the<br />size for a small family.
463,5,It peels oranges. What more could ask for?
464,4,"This is a well designed separator which is easy to clean.  However, it is much larger than the typical separator.  It is 10&#34; long, measuring from the tip of the spout to the edge of the handle, and 5.5&#34; wide. It has markings for up to 4cups (or 1000ml).  This thing is a bit of a space hog."
465,5,"We have had this Hamilton Beach model for about 10 years and it's still working great. We used it about 4 times per week. Just bought another one for our son. The Panini marks are on the top and bottom. It's compact, easy to store and has ample press area. No big frills, does a great job and doesn't have to cost  you a fortune. Don't spend a ton of money, this is a super model."
466,5,I really needed this. It is easier to manage on a hot handle than a pot holder and looks great.
467,5,Eliminates the need for several separate units - simple to use and very easy to clean!
468,5,This timer does exactly what I want it to do.
469,5,"Its good but the heat is bit low , not for big cooking"
470,5,It's so nice to have the ends of the bacon cooked and edible. I would recommend it.
471,5,So much cheaper if you buy in bulk!  Love them.
472,5,love it
473,5,They fit perfectly and do the job.
474,2,I purchased this to ice my forearm. It fits but melts way too fast as the frozen portion is thin. If you like your white wine chilled only moderately for a short time then this is for you.
475,5,Nice champagne bucket stand.
476,5,Works great!
477,5,"Nice one, but I have found it very useful yet."
478,3,"It's alright. Came with the screws loose. Perfect for a novelty item, but that's about it."
479,5,Great color and size. I am very happy with my purchase.
480,5,These are great grinders and the price was right.<br />I don't like the battery operated grinders because they are heavy and drain batteries pretty fast.<br />I don't like the single fill grinders either because it seems wasteful to throw away after it is empty.<br />These are exactly what I wanted.  Good refillable manually operated grinders.
481,2,"They are huge pieces, I might have to return them."
482,5,Love it. I would recommend to others
483,5,"I love this mug.  It it's my coffee hot, it has a wonderful grip on the handle, fits well in my cup holder and it looks greAt"
484,5,Bought it for my housemates (they went to ASU and one of them is from there) and they loved it!
485,5,I bought my mini salt and pepper grinder set last week and am delighted with it. It is so easy to use and swaps from coarse grinding for cooking to very finely ground seasoning in one movement. it feels really nice and solid and is very easy to fill either with coarse ground pepper or peppercorns. I am thinking of getting another set for gifting. Much recommended for people who are looking for Grinder set.
486,5,So far so good
487,1,"I really wanted to love this great sized convection toaster oven.  I read the reviews on Amazon and had high hopes since the price was right.  I love the look - perfect upgrade to match my stainless appliances, and I have always had good luck with Cuisinart. I use it at least once per day.  BUT - I have only had it for 3 weeks and am already having issues with burning foods/over toasting.  I have used the exact same settings with results all over the board - one day items are cooked perfectly, next day - undercooked, next day - burnt to a crisp.  The backlit display light also seems to be possessed.  It comes on and blinks randomly throughout the day - not a huge issue - just weird.  Thought it might have some sort of motion sensor - but, no.  No mention of it anywhere in the information that shipped with the item, no way to turn it off completely.  After researching reviews outside of Amazon, it seems I am not the only one experiencing random heat fluctuations/foods burning and light possession.  I am returning the Cuisinart and going with the Breville BOV800XL."
488,5,These are PERFECT!  Great size and SO easy to clean!
489,3,It wasnt what I expected  But It will do.
490,4,Great scale.  The food guide is not categorized for ease of use.
491,1,"I put the hot water into it, it became cold quickly, just for about 4 hours."
492,5,Nice everyday wine glasses. Arrived in perfect condition.
493,5,excellent quality.  it's small for sandwich or Pasta.  be aware it's for Japanese lunch.<br />  google  &#34;お弁当&#34;  it means lunch.  you will see why it is small.
494,3,The top and bottom fit a bit sloppy but other than that I like it.
495,5,Just as pictured and depicted. Enough room for 2 loaves of bread. Sandwich size.
496,5,I love the ring so that my brown sugar doesn't clump. The size is perfect for a 2lb bag of sugar. It's a great quality product with a tight seal.
497,5,Works great. Arrived on time.
498,5,Really does work!!?
499,5,love love love - great gift and huge!  perfect for parties and large families
500,5,It is what it is. Shipped quickly.
501,4,"They seem to work as well as the food saver brand. Not quite as heavy duty, but close."
502,5,Love it
503,5,best ever
504,5,Great product to store your loose blades and disks. Highly recommended!
505,5,Good price.  Fast service.  Exactly what I needed!
506,5,Good Quality
507,5,You can't go wrong with one of these if you love the meat!!!
508,5,The kettle is everything I expected at a reasonable price.
509,5,"I've been making coffee using a French Press for years, but have always had problems with either the glass breaking or constantly having to tighten the nuts holding the filter/plunger assembly together. The nuts tend to loosen frequently and I've even lost parts down the kitchen sink.<br /><br />Not a problem with this French Press! The quality and design are impressive. No constantly tightening the filter assembly or worrying about tapping the thin glass other French Presses use against the kitchen faucet or dropping it.<br /><br />The double walled stainless steel design keeps the coffee hot for well over an hour. Double bonus!<br /><br />At just under $30, including free shipping, this is a true bargain! Unlike a few past relationships, this is a lifetime commitment I'm glad I made!"
510,5,"Gets the corkscrew off the edge of the counter! Very heavy and balances well, no tipping or unsteadiness at all."
511,5,Excellent value for the exact part that I needed. Shipped very quickly too.
512,3,"Wonderful for as long as it lasted. Eventually the plastic handle broke off. I replaced it with the professional model and immediately discovered that the coarse version of the pro model is far more coarser. This model does not come with a guard or plastic cover like the pro model has, making it a bit of a menace in the drawer. I kept the paper cover for the ten years it lasted. I was surprised it broke. Never washed in a dishwasher.  The plastic simply failed."
513,5,Good quality. Would like the 16 oz however.
514,5,Works perfect for baking. Just what I needed
515,5,Item arrived in excellent condition. A+
516,5,"Works as advertised; keeps liquids as hot or as cold as you want all day long.  I have a Contigo that I also use, but that really only keeps liquids hot for a couple hours.  This Thermos is much better.  The only &#34;issue&#34; I had with it is that the rubber stopper thing under the lid smells chemically and as a result makes your liquids taste funny since smell contributes a large part to taste.  You might want to pop that off and give a good wash before using."
517,3,"The product is pretty standard and good quality. I purchased this product as a gift. However, we received a broken casserole. Needless to say, the return process was very easy. But it was a hassle to return it on behalf of the friends we gifted it to."
518,5,"This blender is awesome. The only flaw is that high impact with concrete surfaces, say a drop off the top of the refrigerator, invariably proves fatal to the blending unit."
519,3,The shells are a lot smaller than expected.
520,5,A wonderful piece of equipment. I recommend it to everyone
521,1,cheaply made
522,5,Great garlic press!!<br />Very convenient to use and most importantly very convenient to clean.<br />I was looking for a garlic press that can press large garlic cloves as well as easy to clean.<br />This press addresses my 2 requirements and works perfectly.<br />I have it for 2 years not and it still works.<br />The blue cleaning brush is very very useful to clean it.<br />Highly recommended!!
523,5,Not sure if theses work they always look the same before and after use but 5 stars for peace of mind
524,5,This is a must have for mixing powdered meds and supplements.
525,5,I have a counter-top flat grill and these hold everything in place nicely. I use them all the time.
526,5,This is our 2nd Flex Brew.  The first didn't work properly so we returned it & bought this one. Right out of the box this unit worked as expected.  Coffee is good & the Kcup side works perfectly!  My family loves this machine.  Only had it for a few days but we are very happy!
527,5,Perfect for boiled eggs.
528,1,The first one I had leaked.  The second one leaked after a long time.  The most recent one leaked out of the box.  Too bad.  I like the microwave-ability.
529,5,Product works wonderfully.  I have cut my K cup cost from .65 cent a cup to only .05 cents!!!!  There is absolutedly no coffee grounds in my cup.
530,5,We have a garden and fruit trees every year to can from. Love to can. These ball lids are great. I can remember my Mother using them
531,2,Very hard to use.  I should have gone for a sturdier one.  I would not buy it again
532,5,Better than spray. Use them in place of parchment paper. Great size to cover the entire cookie sheet. Food doesn’t pick up any off flavors from the silicon. Easy clean up rise and your done. A must have product to add for anyone who bakes.
533,5,"I had a pan from Amazon, I forget the name but it was pink and within days it looked horrible, everything stuck and it was impossible to clean. This pan is awesome. Nothing sticks to it months later. The bottoms looks almost brand new.  I have this in 2 sizes and may get a saucepan."
534,5,"Great product, particularly for nonstick pan surfaces, where you need to protect the coating.  Arrived a day early."
535,5,"I have two now, one under the coffee maker and one under my blender.  They push back so easily so they are not in the way.  I just recommended one to my sister."
536,5,Heats water super quick. Takes up very little counter space. Seems to be quality construction.
537,5,"I received this water bottle as a gift during my chemotherapy treatments this fall and I have not spent a day without it.  Heavy-duty and sweat-free, the hydracentials water bottle makes staying hydrated (and staying ahead of my constant thirst) simple.  I just fill the bottle in the evening, toss it in the fridge overnight, and I have ice cold water all day long.  It was a God-send for me and still is.<br /><br />My only complaint comes in the form of the spout.  Within days of having it, the plastic tab on the spout broke off making opening the bottle a little trickier, however it hasn't impaired my use in the least.  Since it's leak proof as well, I can just toss the bottle in my go bag and I don't have to worry about all of my supplies getting soaked in the process."
538,5,"Present for my niece and she loved it~!  Great quality, arrived with no problems and fast shipping!<br />Brandi N."
539,5,these are the best
540,5,I just love these glass fused plates.  The colours are great and I use mine to serve food on or display Valentine wax tarts or the best to put cookies on.  Love it!
541,4,"Each year I try to do a themed Christmas and this past year was &#34;family heritage&#34;, which went so well that it will be repeated.  My son will enjoy this lovely stein for years to come."
542,5,I used my porcelain souffle and was very pleased with the results.  The souffle was evenly baked and came out just the way the souffle looked on the recipe picture.  The cleanup of the porcelain souffle was very quick and very easy.  I am pleased with this purchase from Amazon.
543,5,Works very well and is very pretty.
544,5,"Works really well. Even the &#34;orange&#34; size isn't very large. I had trouble with larger size, but not huge, oranges. it does do a great job getting the most juice out & leaving seeds behind."
545,5,They feel really nice.
546,5,Bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter. she absolutely loves it. It holds a full turkey carcass. Nice weight and size. Thinking of ordering one for myself.
547,5,Exactly what we were looking for.
548,5,GREAT!  USE IT A LOT!
549,1,This product did not work at all. It didn't count down and was flimsy and poorly made. We returned it.
550,5,Worked great! Better than buying a new one. We have had our vitamix for 12 years and use it daily! This is the first thing I have ever had to fix with it.
551,5,On a scale of 1 to 10...it's a scale of 1 to 10....
552,5,great
553,5,Looks great in person! Everyone was pleased with the look and feel.
554,4,"Don't put the glass in the dishwasher, it removes the printing on it."
555,5,Good customer service and as advertised!  Great little kettle.
556,5,These were so cute. Picture was detailed on them and they were heavy. Very nice!
557,5,Perfect disposable bathroom cups. Very pretty and strong enough to be used more than once - they actually last awhile when used just for rinsing after toothbrushing! Very happy with the purchase.
558,5,"I guess since I knew ahead of time (from reading reviews) that the paint on the plate would start rubbing off, I wasn't too disappointed about this when it happened. I did notice the weird slight burning smell during the first few uses, but it never affected the taste of my coffee/tea. And it has gone away. The main thing I was concerned with was whether it would keep my drink warm and it does. And of course, the lower your drink goes, the hotter it gets."
559,5,"best deal i made on amazon so far, its a steal"
560,5,The best cheese slicer I have ever owned.  Slices all kinds of cheese with ease.
561,2,"Great coffee but cleaning/reassembly is not the easiest. And I also almost lost the small piece down my disposal as I have read in some of these reviews. There ought to be a warning about small parts and a diagram how to reassemble the filter and parts. I am a first time presser and when I disassembled to clean for the first time...did not take note of what went where. Tried to figure it out from the picture on the box but not sure. I think I will exchange this for a Bodum. A friend has one of those. Easier to clean. And the top covers the liquid fully while steeping so the heat does not escape (I saw a reviewer who resorted to foil to cover this one while the coffee brewed). Oh...and for the life of me, I cannot get the beaker out of the metal frame so I expect that will rust soon. Its in there real tight! For me, the cleaning process on the SterlingPro is too much work for a cup of coffee."
562,5,Love the color and the size is perfect. Glad I chose this brand. Hefty feel to it. Will wear well I think.
563,5,"This is a very well made French press. All the parts are machined precisely to fit perfectly.  The top has a beveled indentation on the underside to line up with the spout so pouring proceeds perfectly.  Once water is poured over the grounds, it remains hot in the double-walled canister.  The company also includes extra screens.  It make great coffee.  My one suggestion: allow the coffee to steep for 4 minutes rather than the recommended 3."
564,1,"I never write reviews but was compelled to after buying this little toaster for a surprise Valentines Day lunch. I am not sure what kind of taco standards the other reviewer has but this made the worst taco shells ever. There really needs to be an element inside of the shell cookers because no matter what we did, we could not get the inside crisp. We were using corn tortillas and it recommends cooking at 4-5 minutes. At 5 minutes the top of the shell is black with the inside still soft. We tried every cooking time combination possible and just could not get anything edible out of it. Finally with lunch getting cold, we threw in the towel and put flour tortillas in instead for the recommended amount of time. The flour certainly faired better then the corn tortillas but still, the inside was soft and the top was burnt. Living in San Antonio, we hold tacos to a high regard and although cute, this thing failed miserably. Needless to say, it's going back."
565,5,"I use my ultimate chopper all the time. So when it accidentally broke. I WAS VERY GLAD TO FIND THE REPLACEMENT ON aMAZON. GOOD PRICE, TOO."
566,5,I love it. It makes the plastic wrap easy to cut. Has little rubber feet on the bottom that keeps it from slipping on the counter.
567,5,Unbelievable how easy this slicer is to use.  And saute with olive oil the veggetti is the bomb!
568,5,I use in my kids lunches. Don't bake with them. Still like new.
569,5,"Great cooking utinsil, great pricr"
570,2,"It works exactly as advertised, but after using it I found that I very much prefer cutting it myself with a knife. It's a pain to clean and the core was very difficult to remove from the metal tube. Had to use a knife and break it up before I could pull it out. Not sure if it was the pineapple or the tool. I also find that there's a lot of wasted meat compared to doing it by hand with a knife."
571,5,Very good product would by again
572,1,Rusted after one use
573,5,"They work, they have not broken, they were not overpriced.  What more can you ask for?"
574,3,The coffee cups get stocks in the drawers sometimes. Other than that it's perfect.
575,5,the best toaster we've had yet
576,5,I'm fairly confident I'm unable to live without this now.  Marinating things has never been so quick and easy.
577,5,"Purchased as a gift. It's sturdy, and the printing on it is durable. My friend handwashes it, so I can't say how it holds up in the dishwasher."
578,4,"This is a sharpener for knives and scissors. It has a nice comfortable non-slip grip.  There are pictures on the device which slot is for the scissors and which one is for knives (The middle is for knives and both ends are for scissors).  Alas there is no instruction on how to use it with the blades, I am particularly confused on how to use it for the scissors.  I do not know which part of the blade should be touching which part of the sharpener wheel.  In the end I just went through my gut feeling.<br /><br />Sharpening knives is easier. You pull the blade in between the sharpening wheels. I did a couple of pairing knives and a longer knife.  It worked out very well. I tested it to cut some meats and fruits.  I tried it on the back of my nail and it did the job well.<br /><br />Made in Italy.<br /><br />Sample item was provided to me for evaluation and review."
579,5,Pretty good!!
580,5,"Does what it says, opens cans with ease. I've used this style of opener for several years and would never go back to the conventional style. My favorite feature of this opener is that the batteries load from the top. Believe me, if the batteries die mid-opening you'll love this feature!"
581,5,Love it for zucchini noodles. Cleans easily
582,5,"Arrived on time, was the color I expected and my daughter loved them!"
583,3,"I am not sure what the max temp is but it doesn't seem very hot, especially when you have such a tiny fryer. It takes a long time to reheat for a second batch and it is very small, enough for one portion of french fry and a small portion at that. I'm looking for similar style with more heating power and bigger size."
584,5,"This is a great quality box grater. The 6 different are perfect for making your food and vegetables look amazing for food trays at get togethers or just for fun at home. I love that I can do everything with 1 tool. It's a great size to work with so there's no fumbling around with it or fighting to fit certain foids on it like potatoes. I love making homemade potatoe chips, pickles and shredding carrots for salads. The zester is perfect for adding lemon or lime zest for salsas and chicken. It cuts very easily and smooth. It makes doing tgese things fast and painless. I am very excited to have recieved this for my review. It's definitely a high quality box grater and makes meal preperation so much faster. It's super easy to clean too! I definitely recommend this product."
585,5,"How could these be any better.  They are stirring spoons, they are long, and they work in my bar.  Great price for the pair, and they solved a complaint of a guest bartender with prime shipping.  Oh yeah, they are very effective at turning unmixed drinks into mixed drinks."
586,4,excellent!
587,4,"kinda big, otherwise what I expected"
588,4,"Small, works just like you expect from a scale.  No complaints."
589,3,"Like it but it is only for lightweight things.  The clip part isn't strong enough and even with just dishtowels and cloth placemats, it sags a little.  But works well enough for my needs."
590,5,"I have had a red one for more than 5 years. I just replaced it with a nice black one and I'm pleased. I've only used it a few times but I know what to expect; it does show cut marks and it does warp in the dishwasher, but not so bad that I didn't use it. With the new one I will exclusively hand wash it, but I was impressed with how long my old one held up through hundreds of runs through the dishwasher. These things are incredibly durable! They do fade over time. I'm not sure about germs as we tried not to cut meat on this board, just fruits and veggies. I hope this one lasts as long; it appears to be the same build and quality; I love the grip and the hand hold too!"
591,1,bought two in less than a year and they both stop working.  Ugh!  Such an inconvenience
592,5,The bag is wonderful to drain cheeses. Draining is much faster than with cotton bags.
593,5,"Lovely shape which feels nice your hand. Great for cold drinks since condensation doesn't form on the outside. Although they feel light and slightly brittle, they are holding up well."
594,3,"First, let me say that this is a set of FIVE molds, not six as advertised-minus a star for that.<br /><br />Second, 4 are tiny. If you want to do solid chocolates or truffles with minimal filling, these are your molds. If you wanted to do normal sized ones with an abundance of filling (like I do), then you get exactly one decent mold.<br /><br />Third, the smaller four do not have that nice glossy finish to them, which is noticeable in the finished chocolates. Minus a star for that.<br /><br />If I weren't in a pinch for molds, I would return these and buy different ones. As it stands, I'm stuck with these...at least they were only $20!"
595,5,Broke our carafe at work had the perfect replacement within two days of my order customer service and quality exceptional.
596,5,Wicked sharp
597,5,"Product arrived early, cover fits snug over the bowl, it will not fit over the flour cover.  Very happy."
598,1,"The machine is convenient, but the waste, potential mold issues, greedy play to lock out competitors, and flat out average coffee make this system one that may have hit it's peak.  We put our brewing system in the closet and are now using a simple aeroPress that runs about $25. It makes unbelievable coffee in about the same time with less expense & waste. Plus you get to pick out any coffee beans you want. Remember, the best coffee comes from great beans and good water with heat and pressure. No need for another electric gadget on the counter with below average coffee that you pay too much for. Invest your money in a water filter (& a cheap electic kettle to boil it), and quality coffee."
599,4,"in general its quality is good and with reasonable price, however it can only keep warm around 2 hours."
600,5,Awesome item
601,5,Exactly what I wanted. I have recommended this item to others.
602,1,Bags were too small for bread.
603,5,So pleased to find. Already have several other pieces from this collection. Lovely addition to my &#34;strawberry kitchen.&#34; Well made.<br />d.
604,5,Best purchase!  Bought one a year ago and used almost daily.  Motor burned out after a year of pretty heavy use.  Very easy to use and has become such a useful kitchen item I had to buy another one.  Highly recommend for basic smoothie single serve blending.  Love it for breakfast smoothies.
605,5,I don't use anything else but my Duxtop!  Love it!!!
606,5,delivered too my door on time in perfect condition. every one that bakes should have one of these. will last for many generations!
607,5,This replaced an older one I'd had for years. Works well
608,5,"Best &#34;egg&#34; slicer around. I had one years ago and lost it in a move and every other one I've tried has broken or the wires have stretched out. It works great with fresh mushrooms, avocado, strawberries, small balls of fresh mozzarella and of course hard-boiled eggs. Perfect even slices every time with minimal effort."
609,5,"I purchased this set of spoons because it included a 3/4 teaspoon measure, a size that is pretty hard to find in other sets.  I also needed a 1/8 teaspoon measure that was stainless steel so I could measure an essential oil (which can corrode plastic spoons).<br /><br />The spoons, which are 18/10 stainless steel, come shrink-wrapped with the Manufacturer's Guarantee (a product tag that contains the UPC code for the set and lists the manufacturer's website).<br /><br />So far, I'm happy with them.  They're sturdy and don't feel cheap, and I can tell that the narrow, rectangular heads are going to make getting to the bottom of my spice jars a lot easier.  The handles are long (about 4 1/2 inches), but not long enough to make measuring awkward.  The spoons nest well and don't take up a lot of drawer space.<br /><br />My only complaint has to do with the metal chain that holds the spoons together.  While it is \\""flexible,\\"" as stated in the product description, it is not easily removable - unless it is severed with a pair of pliers (and once broken, it does not link back together).  I had to do just that, because I found the spoons harder to use when linked together (due to the combined weight of each spoon).<br /><br />With that said, I'm still giving this set of spoons 5 stars because of its inclusion of a 3/4 teaspoon measure, which eliminates a lot of unnecessary measuring compared to using other standard spoons (like a single 1/4 teaspoon or 1/4 teaspoon + 1/2 teaspoon).<br /><br />If you're looking for a 3/4 teaspoon measure or want a sturdy, well-made stainless steel set, go for it!  I did, and I don't regret my purchase."
610,5,cleans fast  very thoroughly
611,5,Butter Keeper is great! I love that it keeps my butter fresh and soft - ready to spread on a piece of toast.
612,5,This knife sharpener works very nicely.  It leaves the blade very sharp.  I'm happy with the results.
613,5,I love them! It is very convenient how they are magnetic and stack so they do not get lost. I do wish they came in more measurements though.
614,5,Loved them Loved them. Made very well and came in on time. My man loved his. Will buy again
615,5,Perfect
616,3,It works for the size that it is.
617,5,"Very easy to use and clean.  I had tried a handheld spiralizer that was a nightmare to use before this one, and it was a night-and-day difference.  I highly recommend."
618,5,Love my Spiralizer!  Works great
619,5,I searched far and wide for a convection toaster oven. this one is perfect I love it. It is accurate and easy to keep clean. I just wish I could find a baking tray that would fit in it.
620,5,Works great. Less time running to the microwave to reheat my tea.
621,4,"In all, the unit does it's job and I like it.    I struggled with whether or not I should give it 3 stars instead of 4. There are several simple quality control issues that can be addressed but the bottom line is... It's not a basic white wire rack and the price is right. You shouldn't expect perfection if you are not willing to pay for it. If you consider the following, it is well worth the money paid: (you just have to be smarter than what you are working with)    Where will it be hung? The jars do not fit as \\""snugly\\"" in the shelves as shown in the picture. So if you are mounting the rack on a door, keep in mind that the jars will shift. (Mounting the rack off center closer to the hinge side of the door will definitely reduce the amount of shifting.) Mine is mounted on the inside of my pantry door, close to the inner hinges, and although the jars do shift it is not enough to make me nervous. Everything seems to be safely restrained, but I'm NOT in the habit of slamming my pantry door either.    If you plan to mount the rack in-sight on a wall, I highly recommend leveling the rack by the shelves rather than screw/hole placement. I purchased 2 of these at the same time. With he first rack I hung, I made sure the holes for the screws were level. Once the unit was in place I noticed the shelves were not level. (Just enough to make it visually disconcerting for those that expect perfection, NOT enough to impair the effectiveness of the unit in any way.) With the second unit I leveled it via the shelves and got a much better, eye pleasing outcome.    You should also note that whereas the shelves are deeper than your basic (Target brand) square spice jar, they are NOT quite deep enough to hold the larger quantity containers you might purchase for things like garlic salt or dried minced onions."
622,5,I love this mug.  The best I have every had.  So easy to clean and you can get at everything to clean thoroughly. Ordered 3 more liked it so much.
623,4,it was a gift
624,5,works exactly the way I expected it to
625,1,useless.
626,5,Works great

628,5,"Love it!  The clear, clean look accentuates the contents of the diffuser, which has enough slitting to diffuse any fruits, herbs, or vegetables that I place in it.  Easy to clean, easy to hold."
629,5,Great little griddle!
630,5,Nice product
631,4,"Works fine.  Not exactly heavy duty, but the extra screens were a bonus."
632,5,works great.
633,5,Works like a water bottle should!
634,4,Given as a gift and they really like it.
635,5,Great bread maker machine.
636,5,We loved these cups!!!  We want more!  When will you have them again!?
637,5,hands down the best made and best performing garlic press that I have ever purchased.  what a great value.  I love my Propresser.
638,5,Love it!  Big difference than other brands I had.
639,3,"smaller than I expected,  the bottom portion of it turned a different color after I wash them in the dishwasher"
640,3,Gets most of the splatter grease.
641,5,Big hit on christmas gift for my step father he loved it the family all got a kick out of it!
642,4,I used them and they worked well but they did stick so next time I will also spray them with oil as well.
643,5,Does everything I need. Works perfectly and looks beautiful.
644,5,Arrived excellent and quick!!
645,3,"Smaller than expected. I guess I previously had the XL one and didn't know it.<br /><br />You can only really fit two larger cloves of garlic in this guy.  But those two pieces will come out nicely minced.  I wish they sold the little paddle to scoop the garlic out.  It's a pain in the ass getting garlic pieces out of this smaller one.  Half the time I have to disassemble.<br /><br />But, if you use a lot of garlic in your cooking like I do, this is a great tool.  Quickly minces it without loosing and quality like it seems you do with a traditional press.<br /><br />Oh, and it's a lot of fun to use."
646,5,Love using my box at the beach each weekend!  Keeps my wine cold even on a nice warm day.
647,5,"If you are still using papers liners....time to stop. Have you not had enough of having the paper liners stick to your cupcakes, or fold over while pouring in the batter? Chelsydale's Silicone Baking Cups are the way to go. You will be able to bake with confidence that your cupcakes will come out perfect every time!<br /><br />No need to use a cupcake or muffin pan, just arrange them on a cookie stick and pour the batter in. Once your cupcakes are completely baked, let them cool for at least 15 minutes. Then gently push up the bottom of the cupcake liner as you carefully peel the sides away, turning the cupcake liner inside out.<br /><br />Using silicone molds leaves the cupcake edges glossy rather than crumbly which makes it so much easier to frost. However, they will tend to dry out quicker so make sure to store them in an air tight container.<br /><br />Bright colorful color, dishwasher safe, and comes in a convenient storage container.<br /><br />Besides cupcakes, freeze your kids favorite juices for a refreshing treat, caramel custards, or how about some jumbo jello shots? There are a ton of uses - the possibilities are endless.<br /><br />Product sample."
648,4,"Good bags, they hold about 3 cups popped corn, I saw another review that said a cup and a half but that must have been a pretty loose fill. I used a large coffee mug as a scoop for this and was able to get three of them into this by fully expanding the bag. The only downside as some have pointed out is that you can't sit this bag down as the bottom doesn't flatten out."
649,5,"Excellent quality, my daughter loves it. It was a nice stocking stuffer."
650,5,This is a must have item. Makes grilling steaks or fish very easy.
651,5,"Works great, looks nice.  I would buy again."
652,5,"I love this mixer, the blades are off center a little so it ends up scraping the bowl while it mixes"
653,5,"as described,"
654,5,A geat inexpensive set of cordial glasses
655,5,"I love love love this coffee maker. I will never go back to any other kind. It's NOT made in China, which is hard to find! It's made in The Netherlands. It's easy to operate, easy to put together out of the box, easy to clean. Expensive but worth every cent. Coffee is HOT!"
656,4,Works really well and seems sturdy so far.  Could be a bit larger for big strawberries.
657,5,Great for any Marilyn fan
658,5,Looks crazy good on my counter!  Works great too.  Very pleased with purchase. Quality product!!
659,5,weighs my flowers NICE
660,1,I bought this for college seeing the high rating and boy was I wrong doing that. Within 3 weeks of us in it the spring in the handle had broken and had caused it to make me physically hold down the button in order to use the water heater. I have a rubber band and pen contraption that does it now but that doesn't change the dissapintment I had in this product.
661,5,"Noisy, but works a charm!"
662,5,I like it very much.
663,5,Have used these stoppers for years and they work better than others we have tried..
664,4,perfect
665,5,"Awesome gift bag, specifically for the saying and really great quality. Sturdy and thick bag, not cheap."
666,5,Gave as a gift to my mother and I'm jealous!!!  I have one but it is not as nice as this French press is and it looks great.  Thank you!!
667,4,it should bring replacement for the tips.
668,4,It was a christmas present and was a huge success.
669,5,"I watched my wife cut up a chicken and I shuddered. That could have been my fingers or toes. It's very sharp and powerful, be careful."
670,5,excellent coffee maker it was a  Christmas gift
671,5,Bought them for my wife. She absolutely loves them. Already buying her more items from RR's line. High quality (so far).
672,5,Nice size for smaller meals.  Extremely well designed and no problems so far.  Very pleased with every aspect of the Cooker.
673,5,Great bottle for a germaphobe! The cap keeps the straw covered.
674,4,"My husband's favorite Christmas gift this year! Quick, easy and fun for any hot dog lover. Didn't give it 5 stars because buns were hard to fit in and parts of the bun that touched the walls burned. Was not easy to clean. But all in all I would buy it again and would definitely recommend.  A tip for customers:: don't use natural casing franks. They split"
675,5,Love these silicone lids. I use them for microwaving and they really seal tightly. The price is excellent and they nest inside each other for compact storage.
676,5,Great idea.  Redoing all my recipe cards and covering with this plastic since my old ones are a mess!  Works great!!
677,5,it works great.
678,5,"best sliding razor knife I have ever owned, strong, light weight, thin."
679,5,It was wonderful to have a Cookie Press and Icing Decorating Kit all in one.<br />It was also wonderful to clean up. Very simple!!!!!  Loved it .  that why I ordered 3 of them.<br />Jackie O
680,5,Love it! Water tastes great and I can finally stop lugging around the 10 gallon PLASTIC bottles and just get straight from my apt.
681,5,"I recently purchased the starter kit after seeing a youtube explain how to use the vacu-seal unit with the foodsaver jar sealer.  So I bought both the starter kit and the jar sealer and I'm very, very pleased.  The vacu-seal seals the mason jars perfectly.  I've also experimented with using the vacu-seal bag, and so far after 24 hours, it's holding its seal just fine in the freezer.  However, the bags are way too expensive for me, so I experimented with using the vacu-seal bag as a chamber to seal other much less expensive ziploc bags.  I only received the medium size bags, so the quart bags have to be pushed in to fit.  Of course I don't have the ziploc bags full -- I use them to seal single-servings of meals I prepare for the freezer.  I started the zipper a bit, and after using the vacu-seal to get out as much air as possible, and while the vacu-seal bag is still sealed, I run my fingers along the ziploc in the ziploc bag.  Then I remove the ziploc bag and quickly make sure it's tightly sealed.  I've gotten some pretty good vacuums that way.  However, I think it would work much better if I had the larger bag to use for the vacuum, so I found a bag of 7 on eBay and ordered them tonite.  Expensive for 7 bags, but I will only use them as chambers to seal other much less expensive bags.  I've sealed about a dozen jars and about a dozen bags so far and am very, very pleased that I do not have to buy an expensive vacuum sealer.  Thank you Packmate."
682,5,Amazing quality!
683,5,Seem like good quality. Just right for soup.
684,5,Came just as described. So many for so little price! Put them to work right away and they did great!
685,4,Be warned it is very heavy but will last forever
686,2,"I like the soda machine but I got it because we love ginger ale. Guess what, no store carries regular ginger ale. So if you like the rest of the soda options you may like it."
687,5,"Excellent quality. Solid wood, nice size for toddlers, rolls very well."
688,5,My husband's favorite Christmas gift!!! He loves it so much I am jealous. I am off to order my own!
689,3,"It works....ok? I wish that you could set a temp/time(like a toaster) and just press the button. I bought this specifically for toasting english muffins. The toasting is always different each time and I usually need to watch it to make sure it doesn't burn. &#34;Ain't nobody got time fo' that!&#34; I am a busy mother of three and I can barely function before breakfast. I don't want to dial and babysit! LOL! While I am wishing... my last one had a cooking tray, great for tuna melts! Happy shopping friends! &#60;3 &#60;3 &#60;3"
690,5,Great Buy-was a gift-recipient was pleased.
691,2,"Arrived in shatters, had to send back."
692,5,What a great product. We used it on a sirloin steak and London broil. Both came out very tender. We tenderize all meats and some fish like haddock and swordfish. It's dishwasher safe to keep it germ free and it is priced right. Friends have more expensive 60 or more blades and the results are the same. Save yourself the money to buy a steak.
693,4,Obviously great quality flatware. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because they spot because they're so shiny.
694,5,It went into a Christmas stocking and the receiver laughed big time.
695,5,thanks!
696,5,Love it! Great design and options.
697,2,"Color is not depicted well.  If you fill too high, leaks from around lid.  Maybe spout is not placed correctly.  Very disappointed for the price."
698,5,Quick delivery. Item exactly as I had hoped. 5 star!
699,5,I like options!.....  Like the option to cook at what temperature I want in the oven and not restricted to 350 degrees or less with the black knob that comes with these pans. It's not like these pans are cheap!  That said the knob fixes the problem.  Shame on you Le Creuset!
700,5,Great stacking mugs.<br />Nice fit in the hand to drink with.
701,1,Didn't work with veu
702,2,"I like the timer but it completely died after 7 months. Didn't drop it and it didn't have contact with water, just stopped working."
703,5,Product worked exceptionally.  It was all that I expected.  It is very powerful and easy to clean.  Extremely satisfied with the purchase of this product.
704,5,I got this item for our home and my parents love it and use it more than I even get to use it. The motor is strong enough to do vegetables like broccoli! Smoothies and drinks are a staple in our home now.
705,5,"Item arrived as stated and they were as described.  Packaged well, none broken upon deliverly."
706,5,"Who can resist a flushing toilet on the fridge? It's solid plastic, it's not flimsy or cheap feeling.  I found the magnet on the back to be strong, so it sticks when you walk away. The sound is loud and realistic. What more can you ask for in a flushing toilet magnet?"
707,5,daughter-in-law asked for one for christmas-she loved it
708,4,Have only made about 20 snow cones so far.  Works great with standard ice cubes.  Can't wait for summertime margaritas!
709,5,It is just whati expected
710,5,cute
711,2,Did work for ours.
712,5,"i love it  it  makes my day. you don't  have  to move it  to  put water in it  and it  is  so  easy to  tend  to. it was  just  what i was  looking  for, i got  tired of  moving  the  pot  all  the  time.. it  makes  good  coffee, and  is  not  noisy. best i have  found.again  i love  it.i had  bought  3 pots before  this  one  ,  but  no more coffee makers  for  me  this  one  is  the best."
713,4,"This was a replacement for the same model we had for about 4 years.<br />Old model was still working but the display light for about a year would not go above dim, then finally no display.<br />Made it tough on setting the timer for brew when day light savings time comes and goes.<br /><br />New machine is great, only the top cover for the reservoir is no longer attached, by design I guess."
714,5,Excellent product and service!
715,5,Works really well for cutting out clay for Christmas ornaments.
716,3,"Quality not up to par. I received this as a Christmas gift. The porcelain was cracked on the inside and glazed over, terrible quality control. I have read lots of reviews about several Bonavita products though and I guess I am not surprised, they are not know for their high quality standards. I sent it back and have another on the way. I will update the review after receiving and using for awhile. I am already more than a little leery of the plastic handle/stopper assembly breaking as it is know to do.    1/7/15  I have received a new dripper. While this one is not cracked for the price paid the quality is still poor. Imperfections in the glaze flecks of color/dirt that were glazed over, the porcelain is not smooth in spots. The functionality however is amazing it makes an excellent cup of coffee. I do not follow Bonavita's guide to make it though as I found it to turn out to weak for my taste. I use a 14 to 1 ratio with a similar grind for a Hario. Preinfuse for 30 sec, add rest of water stir 6 times and cover for 4 min and drain."
717,5,Love it!!
718,5,Easy to use. Coffee taste amazing.
719,5,Very durable and easy to use.  I love the way it screws the cork right out of the bottle.
720,4,Bought for my bf's relatives and they loved them !Good quality and they come well packaged!
721,5,This is an excellent water bottle! Ice has remained in the bottle after almost 24 hours. No other water bottle has ever come close. Easy to hold as well. Highly recommended.
722,5,"I love this teapot, it's exactly what I ordered perfect size doesn't drip and overall beautiful.  I have been looking for a really long time and I'm glad I took my time and found this it's perfect!"
723,5,Great storage!
724,1,It breaks at the same on all of them don't buy avoid this product .Very short warranty !
725,5,Great product and arrived quick!
726,4,Work well
727,5,Bought for a Christmas present for my wife and she loves them.Now she has the full set.Fast delivery
728,5,Everything was perfect
729,5,No water bottles compare. You get SO MUCH more volume for the time spent drinking. I'm able to drink way more water every day because I don't have to suck the water through a straw. It also makes them much easier to wash because you don't have to &#34;reassemble&#34; them every morning. I'm never going back!
730,5,I tried this for the first time over the holidays and love it.  It's easy to use and clean and you don't have a dirty cookie sheet to wash.  My cookies slide right off.
731,5,"Makes thinner waffles, not really belgian."
732,5,"Awesome, fast shipping"
733,5,"Update for people who complain about stains and pitting from salt: It's NOT the pan's fault! Follow these instructions, and you won't have any problems. [...]  I have two of these now, and I'm getting ready to order a third and I have no issues with mine!<br /><br />Very impressed! I have only used this once so far, but I was happily surprised at how quickly and evenly my food heated, and how easy it was to clean. Almost all my other cookware was Calphalon with some sort of Teflon or other non-stick coating. I planned to replace all those with stainless steel cookware based on the purported toxicity of Teflon that I have read about. I had no idea how much of a difference it would make with simply heating my food. I'm just really impressed with this pan, and I'm going to look for more of the same when it's time to replace my other cookware!!!"
734,4,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son-in-law. It came when it was supposed to. After he opened it he brought it to me and showed me how it worked. He is an avid user of his pepper mill and he was thrilled with all but the small reservoir. He said the electric mills are hard to come by at a reasonable price. I hope this one works well for him.
735,5,Bought it as a gift.
736,5,Love it! Works awesome
737,5,Awesome!
738,5,It works like its suppose to.
739,5,received order on time.  It was a gift.  Good value for money.
740,1,"Ordered cup with Dala Horse pattern; received cup with only colored squares, no horse image at all."
741,5,"No question these are the best wine glasses at the best price. Forget about Reidel and other high priced wine glasses.<br />Beautiful on the table and a perfect shape for most wines. The glass formulation makes them extra bright and sturdy. They will break of course, but it takes a good knock to do so. Giving them as a gift is ALWAYS appreciated."
742,4,Lots of special recipes available.  The delay cooking is special
743,5,"Got this for Christmas along with a gorgeous maple john boos cutting board! I have several globals, this one might become my favorite quickly, diced potatoes just to see if it's equalled my veg. Knife, the blade glides through like butter. I could slice and chop all day with this one, have to get a whole chicken to butcher and see how it does! All in all, I am thrilled with all my globals and this one in particular!"
744,5,Wonderful product.  Looks good and preforms wonderfully.
745,1,garbage... cheaply made and does not properly function.  Black & Decker continues to produce crap.  Unfortunate for a once great American Company.
746,5,"We think this may be the best of the gadgets of this kind on the market. Plus, Amazon had a great price on it, so that it wasn't as expensive as one of the models that I thought looked too rickety.  This has been a GREAT buy.<br /><br />We had a Sharper Image version and loved it, but it stopped working about a year after we got it. This Secura oven feels more substantial, heavier, in its top where the cooking elements are, so we hope it will last longer. Superior to the Sharper Image model:  the Secura oven's tray/base is metal, as opposed to plastic, so the heavy glass pot rests more securely; the glass parts seem to me to be thicker glass than I remember the Sharper Image oven to have been, and the glass-rimmed top fits into a deeper ridge in the pot/base than I remember of the Sharper Image model, so that it feels to me as if the top is less likely to slide off accidentally.  The Secura top fits down inside the pot, while if I recall correctly, the Sharper Image top  had a ridge in it that the pot's top-edge fitted into.<br /><br />I notice that some brands are making it sort of upside-down, where the pot becomes the top that fits over a shallow base that contains the rack, etc. Just FWIW, I can't imagine this construction would work as well as this Secura construction, where you have a full-sized pot or bowl to contain your food and one or more racks (or none), with the heating element/fan gadget embedded into a glass top that fits securely into the top.  Also, if another brand isn't heavy glass, then I wouldn't advise buying it.  The food comes out so tasty in this unit because it closes so tightly, and no steam or anything escapes while the cooking is taking place.  The fewer places where something might go wrong, the better, in my opinion.<br /><br />This Secura convection oven makes the BEST whole chicken or turkey that one could possibly hope for.  It seals in the juices under the skin, while it cooks from the inside and the outside, so that the finished product is the juiciest roasted fowl I've ever had.  We bought an especially large turkey for Christmas this year, so it didn't fit into the Secura-- even with the extender ring-- but that didn't deter us!  My husband took a big cleaver and cut the turkey down the middle, laterally, and roasted it, half at a time, in the Secura.  Even roasting it TWICE like that, it still didn't take anywhere near the time it would have taken to have roasted the whole turkey in our regular range oven.  Plus, the juicy tenderness of the meat just can't be beat.<br /><br />Once you get used to cooking with one of these, I believe you'll find-- as we have-- that you can't cook without it.roduct is the juiciest roasted fowl I've ever had.

747,5,Bought the keurig reusable kcup filter and it works great. Husband is happy and I didn't dish out too much for his gift lol
748,5,I ve ordered thermometers before and they've all been good quality and reliable.
749,5,Good size and nice picture.
750,5,"Nothing exciting to say.  I just like these glasses very much.  I have been using them for years, and of course I break one from time to time, but can always order more.  Very happy they keep making them."
751,1,"I'm sure it's a nice machine once you can get a blade that fits so that it'll work. For now, we just pakcked it up as best we could and tomorrow I'm bringing it back to Target.<br />Very disappointing ;-("
752,5,Great!!!!!!
753,5,Quick delivery. Good product. All parts work perfectly. Great storage piece.
754,4,"We like are Corelli, we had an older pattern that we could not find in retail stores so it was nice to be able to match it up. The only problem with it is the coffee mugs are very heavy to pick up which is surprising because the dishes and easy to use."
755,1,Kind of expensive for a plastic cup and the one I got didn't have a straw oh well too late to exchange in time for Christmas
756,4,"During the four weeks that the unit worked, it was outstanding.  Cooked everything to perfection. Subtracted one star due to poor quality from this manufacturer, as the fryer quit working altogether. Purchased this item from BJ's Wholesale club for $99, rather than Amazon, as their price was better. I have since returned it to the store. Would have purchased another one thinking that maybe I just got a lemon, but the fryer is nowhere to be found anymore other than from Amazon with a high shipping rate.  You can't even find the fryer from the manufacturer's web site (kalorik.com); guess they have discontinued it due to poor quality."
757,5,"these are the best sharpening steels around. A truly superior product, and US made to boot. Enough said."
758,3,"This item is well made but the function it perform is not worth the expensive price being charged for this item. My bad for knowing better, yet spending so much money for this item. Would not recommend."
759,5,"omg i love these so much.<br /><br />you can feed a small country if you make soup in this thing.<br /><br />super easy to clean, light and thin enough so it doesnt take forever to boil."
760,5,Love the kettle!
761,5,Met my expectations
762,1,Ally Oops<br />The Precise Heat 3 1/2 - Quart Surgical Steel Oil Core electric skillet is a pleasure to use and easy to clean.  I fry beef steak and hamburgers on a regular basis as well as shredded fried potatoes.  Besides that it is a real beauty on the kitchen counter.
763,5,"Great pressure cooker.  I have Futura as well as Presto which is probably the highest selling pressure cooker.  I prefer Futura as it cooks twice as fast as Presto! It is easy to clean, pressure release is a snap and it is good looking.  I encourage you to try it."
764,5,This is ann excellent way to keep my bananas in good shape. Well made. I am pleased
765,5,This is perfect for a friend who set up all of the trash and recycle receptacles at an event.
766,5,Love my juicer.  Had it a long while before I had to replace this one little part.
767,1,Broke on third use.  First couple of cans cut great!! Then got jammed on a thicker can. Won't catch the am correctly now
768,5,Perfect &#34;diner&#34; style drinking cups.
769,5,It was  perfect for our church group.
770,5,Love this item. Good quality and it even came with the spout.Sometimes they dont come with one. It was shipped to the wrong address but good people hand delivered it too me that was accidentally sent to them. It was the mailman fault.
771,5,This mat really helps my feet when standing for too long.  It feels like I'm standing in a firm cloud.  I have it in my kitchen.  Great for my back and reduces fatigue.
772,5,"shipped quickly, cool mug! thanks!"
773,5,Love this looks great in my Coke kitchen!
774,4,"Works well. Grinds a little slow, so take off one star. I have used with both pepper and sea salt."
775,1,"Full of scratches right out of the box. Was able to get the glue from the labels off using Goo Gone, but the scratches made them unusable. The price made it not worth it to return."
776,5,"This peeler is by far the best one I have ever used.  It is comfortable in the hand, light and very sharp."
777,5,It is all I expected it to be.....my favorite small appliance!
778,5,I've had it for about 6 months and the coating is sturdy so no rust and it requires almost no cleaning. There's very little space for water to collect and mold.
779,5,This pint glass is perfect for my collection of GL shot glasses and coffee mugs. The logo's are centered just right and the glass is sturdy and heavy enough to not worry about it sitting right. Feels good in the hand and overall I'm very happy with this glass. And to make it better it's made in the USA!
780,2,"At the end of the day, this bag was $9.99 so I can't really be upset at the purchase. It's cheaply made, looks like it has been sewn and re-sewn in a couple of spots due to manufacture error, and the zipper is about as cheap as they come. I am pretty sure the zipper is going to break within the first 5 uses. It would have cost me $7 to return this, so I didn't bother. I have a Hamilton Beach 7 Quart Stay or Go slow cooker and it just fits in this carrier."
781,5,I got this for my son. We both love the movie. Can't go wrong.
782,5,Colors are bright and perky.  It is a wonderful teapot.
783,5,"Excellent Item, Happy with customer Service provided."
784,4,Great for carbonating beverages. I like that I can make it as carbonated as I want. I usually don't like much carbonation.
785,5,Works like a charm.  I also bought the upgrade package for the motor & usb charger.  I use it daily for mixing my protein shakes for the gym.
786,4,"The product is far sturdier than any plastic double walled cup. Unfortunately, the lid starts to cross thread and or fails to seal properly without close attention paid to the process, after about a month of use... Perhaps it needs a new gasket?"
787,1,Cheap quality. Not worth the price.
788,5,"Our first coffee grinder, Proctor Silex, was a re-gift we received about 2005 or 2006.  It finally gave out Oct 2014.  We had purchased a back-up grinder (another brand from a local store) that we just couldn't get use to.  Found the same Proctor Silex on Amazon and placed the order immediately!  We especially love the retractable cord...which is what the back-up grinder was missing!  We love our Proctor Silex, the awesome grinds, and especially that we can tuck it neatly away in our cabinet."
789,5,Works very well with all sizes bagels.
790,5,"Perfect for using a salt holder for all your essential go-to finishing salts.  Very nicely made and pretty, too.  It isn't an eyesore in the kitchen like some can be."
791,4,"Good brewer. Heats up quick, love all the features, especially now that you can make a big pot of coffee. Then only thing I really hate about it is that it doesn't accept non Keurig K cups or K cups made before a certain date."
792,5,I can't begin to tell you how amazing this thermos is. I definitely recommend this product.
793,5,I recommend this pouch to everyone who love taco and burrito shell!  Wished I would have known about them 20 years ago.  Lov'em
794,4,"I like it and the price was right. I'm pretty new to juicing and consider myself a minor juicer. I don't live off the stuff. I can see how some hardcore juicers might not appreciate this machine as it doesn't seem strong enough to take a beating. If you juice multiple times a day every day then this is definitely not for you. But if you are like me and enjoy a glass of fresh veggies every now and then, this juicer is a pretty cost effective alternative to other insanely priced products out there."
795,4,"Magnet often drops lid, but nice that it is tall for big cans."
796,5,"I love these bowl! They are the perfect size for sing,e portion desserts. I also use them to serve dips. They are weighted perfectly so you don't feel like you will break them. They add class to any dinner table. I would definitely record these beautiful bowls!"
797,5,"Fits easily under the Keurig coffee machine, convenient, and a great way to see your coffee or tea inventory."
798,5,Love this!!!  Need another.  Will buy soon
799,5,"Really neat way to oil drumsticks! I used this with an oil/garlic mixture and made awesome chicken legs. Very easy to use and clean, my hands didn't get oily at all."
800,5,Keeps my stuff cold for such a long time!  LOVE having cold water!!!!
801,4,fits and works
802,5,Bought to decorate some wedding cakes.  Love it!
803,5,The delivery was extremely quick and the item was just what I wanted.
804,5,Great
805,5,Works very well with my top bar and langstroth hives
806,1,"I would not recommend this product. It does not allow you to use your own brand of coffee.  In fact, it has been said that a camera inside the unit identifies whether a Keurig authorized cup is being used.  Additionally, settings only goes up to a10 ounce cup of coffee.  There is no element to the keep the carafe warm.  Too bad about this product.  We have two other 1.0 models.  One has worked fine while the other one clogs all of the time, which prompted the new purchase. Thankful we purchased it from Costco and it will be easy to return with no intent to buy another."
807,2,Don't believe that the bolt that holds the adjustable grinder is stainless steel as the grinding nut fused to it after couple of years use and broke off when trying to adjust grind.
808,5,"I am so pleased with this pan. It not only lives up to expectations as a cooking tool, it is very attractive."
809,5,It's great.cook's food well. Cools down fast also. Cleaning is easy to. My aunt loves it alot. We use it about two to three times a week.
810,1,"I used it 3 times and it is already rusting.  I know it was cheap but gee, it should last a week!!"
811,5,This product is very usefull I enjoy very much
812,5,Nice
813,5,Absolutely brilliant! I've been using this kettle for almost 1 year now without any problem. It's simple and practical.
814,5,"Product exactly as described. Stainless steel, measures in 1/8 tsp, 1/4 tsp, 1/2 tsp, 1 tsp, 1 tbsp. Mine were made in India.<br />Sturdy and a little bit on the heavy side. They come tied together, but do not come in a box or a bag"
815,5,A lovely tray for the price! Can be used to serve or as a decoration! Good value for money!
816,5,"I bought these for Thanksgiving, it took me awhile to center properly but used the practice pages."
817,5,I purchased these as enclosed environments for the Fleishe method of cactus seeds starting.  The results have been fantastic.
818,5,Its small but exactly what I needed
819,5,The bread toasts very evenly.  The Keep Warm feature is especially nice when all the food isn't ready at the same time.  Plus it looks nice with my stainless steel appliances.
820,5,I love this thing.
821,5,"Nothing more satisfying than making your own jerky for friends to share.  Have got great feedback from everything that has come out of this dehydrator.  Fruits take quite a bit longer than jerky, but it also goes at a much lower temperature.  With the 5 trays, this will accommodate around 2lbs of beef in slices of about 1/4&#34;.  Freeze your beef for about 5 hours before slicing to get even slices.  Marinate it for a day, and then dehydrate it for 4-6 hours(depending on how you like your jerky)."
822,5,Got it as a gift for my boyfriend. He loved it! Very durable!
823,5,no issues.  Great pancakes
824,5,Looks great on my table with my &#34;grape theme&#34;!
825,5,Perfect.  Exactly what I wanted at a great price.
826,5,Beautiful!
827,5,Did the job intended! Very Pleased
828,5,I have about 4 of these and I love them. They make mixing protein shake quick and easy.
829,4,Does a great job keeping the coffee hot and preventing spills.<br /><br />Could be easier to clean thoroughly. It is not made for complete disassmbly.
830,5,"This coffee filter is AWESOME!  I was kind of skeptical at first, mainly due to the fact that it wouldn't filter the coffee as well, but it filtered just as well as the paper filter.  And in terms of taste, it's much better than the standard paper filter, as it allows oils from the coffee to go through, rather than being absorbed by the standard paper filter.  Another plus is you get to keep reusing the filter over and over, so you don't need to worry about running out/buying new filters.  So for all of my fellow aeropress users who are considering getting this filter, GET IT!"
831,3,"This is the part that I needed for my 3-cup Bialetti.  It solved the sporadic steam leak and extended brew time problem, however this item is a bit pricey."
832,5,"I use these for storing handmade body butters, which I givr as gifts. I'm sure the jars are cheaper somewhere else, but I appreciate not having to go out and get them."
833,5,"This is our third Bunn coffee maker in eleven years so the anticipated life expectancy is about three and a half years.  They quickly brew your coffee with consistent quality.  Because they keep the water hot all the time, they are also great for making tea and hot chocolate.  When this one quits working, I will definitely buy another Bunn coffee maker."
834,5,I like this size to work smaller dinners with.
835,5,My daughter and son-in-law had their own restaurant and used this bowl.  They loved it.
836,4,"I bought this to put sugar in, I really like it except the hole above the spout for air when pouring sugar.  Other than that its great!"
837,5,Great item.  Quick delivery.
838,4,"I immediately used it when I got it. The surface is very solid and seems to last for a long time. Unfortunately the wok is not round, and one place was dent due to transportation? I really don't want to bother returning, and will live with it. Otherwise I would have given it five starts."
839,4,"Perfect little silicone set!  Has a spoon,  spatula,  and whisk!  The basic essential for everyday coming and baking.  Heat resistant.  Easy to clean.  A little small,  but makes it easy to store away."
840,4,good one!
841,5,"Love this and the salsa I made in a short amount of time.  The chopper is exactly as described and was very inexpensive.  The top is sturdy and I expect it will last a long time.  The blades are very sharp.  The whole thing comes apart for easy cleaning.  The rubber grippers on the bottom keep it from sliding around.  At this price, even if the blades get dull with use, replacing it would be easy to do. The only possible improvement I could think of would be a recipe booklet of other things to create with it."
842,5,I love this peeler.  It is easy to hold while peeling vegetables.  I had another peeler which would slip while peeling items and I would often cut my fingers.  I don't have this problem with this one.  It does a great job peeling all types of vegetables.
843,2,The filters are not what I expected. They are two long for the cups.
844,5,"Holds nicely to the blade, just like it should"
845,5,Love these sayings!
846,5,"I concur with my fellow reviewers - this is an excellent set of entry-level pots and pans. Le Creuset they are not, but they're also about ten times cheaper as well! The vast majority of my pots and pans are hand-me-downs from relatives and friends, so I was excited to get some brand new cookware.    Upon unboxing - My initial impressions of this set were very favorable. The red color is great - very vibrant - and the pots and pans feel fairly substantial for aluminum-made. They're not super heavy duty like cast iron, of course, but they don't feel cheap either. I also was happy with the glass lids. Sure, a simple feature that is readily available now, but my old pots don't have them and I appreciate these!    Ease of use - I really like the ceramic nonstick coating, and prefer it to Teflon. Cooking without oil is easy (I sauteed some veggies without oil and had no problems), and cleaning up is a cinch (especially nice since I don't own a dishwasher!).  It will be interesting to see whether the nonstick coating lasts, as some people claim that ceramic coating is more delicate than Teflon. I plan on religiously using non-metal utensils on these so as not to mar the finish (and probably not the ones that came with the set - these Prestige utensils are not so prestige), but will update my review if I notice any chipping.  I like the rubberized handles and love that I don't have to mess with potholders. I also really love that these are oven safe to 350 degrees! Anything that cuts down on the dishes in my dishwasher-less apartment gets an A+ from me.     Overall, a really nice set of cookware that I anticipate using for years to come. I would recommend this set, especially given it's low price. Even though I received this set through Amazon Vine, I try extremely hard to write my reviews as if I had paid the full purchase price, for I feel that is only fair for those who read and rely on reviews."
847,5,same other one I got  . agt.
848,5,"After using the Tea Leaf Infuser daily, I've come to appreciate its subtle qualities.<br />It is very easy to use.  The insulated top and drip tray means it is safe and not messy.<br />The stainless steel base nicely detaches and attaches to add or remove the tea leaves.<br />I like the way it floats with the infused tea wafting down from the infuser.<br />It is a great product and a pleasure to use."
849,3,"Some of the words on the dice (fie on him) we didn't understand, but we were drunk so it didn't really matter. We had fun with them."
850,1,"Filled with rust in the buttom, I urge you to check yours also!"
851,5,"Great machine would recommend it.  Real easy to use, quick and taste is great."
852,5,"I do like to drink wine occasionally.  Especially Merlot.  Shipping was swift. It comes with instructions and nice bag. I poured a glass of wine and then poured a glass thru the aerator.  Then I tasted both.  The regular glass of wine was a little tart and not as airy.  The wine that had been thru the aerator was light tasting, airy with no bitterness and more of a fruity taste.  So much better than a regular glass of wine.  I liked that you can use any spirit in the aerator.  Love things that can be used more ways than one.  Also, you have no leaks or spills when using it. Clean up only takes a few seconds.  No stains from the wine either.  I could definitely see taking this to parties with me very portable.  This would definitely be a great gift for a family member or friend."
853,4,"This is a thin steel pan.  It's OK,  but the DeBuyer mineral B is a whole lot better pan, unless you just want a thin pan.  The 6 1/4 dimension is the outside dimension of the pan, so this is fairly tiny.  It's thin, but not flimsy thin, in fact if I were still  backpacking, I would have no problem taking this pan to cook over a fire."
854,4,worked as expected
855,3,"no cleaning liquid, need to find some for clean process, the machine is no problem, work properly good"
856,4,The best household kitchen ever you can smash garlic with cilantro and put in your favorite meals. I love it.
857,3,"Can't be overstated how difficult it is to fill this unit  with the overflow holes if you want to make 12 cups!!  After reading the other comments, I thought I could do it.  But I use the Brita filtered water, and even though I am fairly mechanical and not stupid, I find it a real challenge to keep from getting water all over the counter.  And unfortunately, it falls right on the cord, which makes it extremely dangerous, as well!  There is LOTS of room in the pot if you fill clear to the holes and brew, and lots more room in the water reservoir above the holes.  I found this unit too tall to fit where I want it, because they made the reservoir so tall.  Stupidity designed this unit!!  It works fine other than flooding & possibly electrocuting me, but I wish I had ordered another brand.  I wish they had kept the old design, and just engineered the unit to last longer.  Pffffft."
858,5,"Not wanting to be obligated to always have to use the expensive k-pods, we decided to go with the FlexBrew coffeemaker.  It is really nice to be able to have a single cup when desired and the regular use of the full size coffee pot.  It also comes with the small brass coffee filter in the event you don't want to purchase the k-pods. The only disadvantage is if you fill the coffee maker with water then decide you want a single cup it won't work.  This works okay for us, we plan accordingly.  We have had ours for several months and find it to be a good quality coffee maker and a good alternative to the Keurig.  We have even added the Hamilton Beach matching toaster and that has been great too."
859,5,Gift - person loved it.
860,5,Awsome.  Now I can enjoy my restaurant type chopped salads.
861,1,"These filters do NOT fit the Keurig Water Replacement Kit (for single K-cup models sold after 2007... sold seperately). They are smaller than the Keurig Six Water Filters (model 5073, see Amazon link http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JV8ZUS/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=A23RG8A7MD8G7S), so they are going back to the seller."
862,4,it will be better if the lid can be locked...
863,5,Helps keep my Moroccan tangine from cracking.  Love the product.
864,2,I should have read the other reviews and the description more fully.  The pic makes these look like they would hold a typical 5 or 6 ounces but they definitely hold less than half that.  These are a gift so I'm not going to test it but I can see what everyone is saying about these being tipsy.  Very fragile and not well balanced.<br />But I can't say anything bad about the seller.  Decent ship time and product is as described.  I just didn't do my due diligence to read the description thoroughly.  My bad!
865,1,It's to stiff
866,4,The molds are pretty deep- so expect to use a lot of chocolate/candy melts when making these!
867,5,"Here are my stats:<br />100 corks received - all natural cork, no synthetic & all used but in good condition.<br />9 are 1.5&#34; long<br />68 are 1.75&#34; long<br />22 are 2&#34; long<br />1 is a random champagne style.<br />About 75% of them have a wine stain on the end.<br />Product arrived as described and I'm very happy with my purchase, will order again if needed."
868,5,LOVE THIS MUG
869,3,"It works well, but best suited for just a regular 6 oz coffee mug. I use a 16 oz travel mug which is tedious to fill.  Add water to the brim and wait for it to drain, repeat, repeat.  Requires attention for big cups.<br />That said, design is great, the coffee brews to a good strength and the opening at the bottom allows you to view the cup contents to determine when it is sufficiently filled. The top edge has a lip to hold onto to avoid burning your fingers.  A ridge on the under side keeps it centered on the cup so it doesn't slide off.  As long as you use it on a stable surface, the fact that it is a little &#34;tippy&#34; is not a problem."
870,2,Ok
871,5,Does a great job with squashes !  A++++++++++
872,5,"Love my new kitchen scissors!  These are a nice heavy duty pair of scissors. I used them so far to cut through pet food bag, opening plastic wrapped containers, and trimming fish.  I like that these fit nicely in a case and I was able to place the case on the side of my fridge.  The case and scissors are holding well to the fridge. Other scissors I have had are usually placed in a draw, and I am always fishing them out.  I like the idea of having it in a magnetic case for easy access."
873,5,"This is my first ever review, so, know I am serious about how happy I am with this frother. I love this thing! I have been a barista in the past and I am serious about how creamy and thick my latte foam is. I have owned several of these hand held frothers, paying as much as $25.00 for one thinking it would be great. NOT! Just purchased this frother and it's the BEST! It is quiet, speedy and the foam is worthy of a cappacino foam. I am sad as I tried to buy 2 more for friends and both Amazon and company were out of them. I had to by different kinds..boo! So please Epare, let me know when you are back in stock as they are perfect Christmas gifts.....Cheers!"
874,5,Perfect!!!!!
875,2,I have used this for several years now. The point of weakness and failure is the plastic handle on the lever. The replacement knob has been discontinued.
876,5,great-thanks
877,5,I have used this many times to bake on but especially as a handy kitchen tool with the measurements on the front!
878,5,"The Ball 125th Anniversary Collector's Jar 1-gallon can be used for many things and occasions.  I will use it at Easter for Beet-Pickled Eggs.  Try it as a terrarium, to hold coffee pods, filled with ornaments and lights, use your imagination.  It is a great jar, the seller shipped it immediately without any problems.  Go for it!"
879,5,"I just want to say that as soon as I pulleD this out of the box, I fell in love with it! My fiancé (who does a lot of cooking, as well) and my father (who doesn't usually cook) both loved this, too! This strainer is light, easy to use, and feels great in my hands! I really enjoy that it stores flat- we already have 2 strainers that take up a lot of room and are a pain! This will be perfect for when I'm steaming vegetables for my 9 month old, among many other things!"
880,5,"I have only had this for a few days, but used it 3 times already.  I like how solid and sturdy it feels in my hand, and the finger guard is a nice touch.  It cuts food well, and hopefully it will hold up well.  The only thing I didn't like about it was that it did not come with a sturdy plastic case for the wheel blade."
881,5,The best set! Durable and pretty nice.
882,5,"I love this, and I'm so glad I bought it. I've had no trouble with butter falling out. It keeps our butter nice and fresh; so much better than margarine! It also looks great (I got the Sea Spray)."
883,5,"I love this! It has a great spot to keep the infused fruit without getting to the straw, and it cleans nicely! I use it daily."
884,5,We used these as our topper for our little wedding cake! We got tons of complements. You can't tell they're s&p shakers at all.
885,5,My kid loves it.
886,5,I use this to keep earrings and rings neat on my dresser and it works great and looks stylish. Saw a similar item at Anthropologie for three times the price.
887,5,I have used probably 4 times in the short time I bought it and it has worked great! Family loves it!
888,5,jk
889,3,"It's important that, when turning on this scale, the scale is on some flat surface and has nothing weighed on it.  The nice thing I like about this scale is that there's a &#34;tare&#34; button (&#34;T&#34;).  That means, if I want to measure some food in a bowl, I can weigh the bowl first, press the Tare button, and have the scale reset to 0.  When I pour my food in, it measures the mass of the food rather than the bowl and the food.  It saves some mental arithmetic.<br /><br />The scale doesn't come with the needed 2 AAA batteries, but that's to be expected from such an inexpensive product."
890,5,Very cute bag to carry your bottle of wine out of the house to go to a party!  Keeps it cold and it is sturdier than carrying in a grocery bag.
891,5,good
892,5,Dr. Oz said that whipped butter is the best but it's hard to dig out this scoop is perfect for that.
893,5,"Pretty good for a cheap little scale.  More accurate than I thought it would be.  Used for weighing mountain bikes, demonstrating block and tackle advantage to cub scouts....and general tension scale duties.  Stays in the toolbox.<br /><br />Keep the box, it helps protect it."
894,1,My macarons stick to this miserable mat NO MATTER WHAT and it's impossible to clean!!!
895,5,Be careful these knives are very sharp!! They look wonderful as well.  Very happy with the set
896,5,Works great. Pulls the cork right out.
897,5,"Really handy and works well, especially for the price"
898,5,I love it. Do recommend the seller. Received on 2nd day.
899,5,"excelente producto, ya he realizados bastantes granizados y ha dado la talla. estoy encantada"
900,1,"Openers ok but Frost keeps sending me email, hence 1 star."
901,5,"I had a kitchen and it finally gave out. could not live without it. So wonderful for mixing cookies, cakes, meatloaf, etc. This one is so sleek and modern looking in the metallic looking blue. Totally satisfied with purchase."
902,5,"Arrived quickly and packaged adequately. The drainer is a little larger than I expected, but it works for left or right hand and on just about any pot."
903,5,"Great knife from Victorinox. Very Sharp.The Fibrox handle has such a nice feel. I didn't realize how large the 10in knife was, though. I would have probably opted for just the 8in."
904,5,Love these square cookie and biscuit cutters.
905,5,This is perfect for what I have in mind for a party.  I really like the appearance and look forward to using these.
906,5,The tempered glass is incredibly strong. I love this blue color. I have purchased for myself and my daughter and her family. Stacking saves cabinet space. I recommend Picardie Duralex to anyone. The marine blue color is very special.
907,4,"Reasonably accurate sometimes off by a .1 or so, just check with a nickel to make sure it reads .5, or a dollar bill being 1 gram, came calibrated"
908,5,Great price. Great product.
909,3,Returned did not fit my Krups
910,3,It gets the job done but within about two months the &#34;hi&#34; setting stopped working.
911,5,"Fantastic, just as expected. I have relatively low cabinets; the under-machine drawer organizer I was using in a different apartment no longer worked in my new space so I had to look for alternatives. Very sturdy and clean looking. Would recommend."
912,5,I have a love hate relationship with my glass stove top.. Works great but cleanup is 20 minutes.. The nuwave works faster.. Cleanup is a snap.. All my cast iron pans work great.. I'm thinking about getting another nuwave and using them instead of my stove top..
913,5,"I use this for my bread baking.  Pizza bread, etc...  I really like it."
914,3,"I only use this skillet for a few things; one being french toast. If bread slices were the size that they were 5-10 years ago there probably wouldn't be a problem. However, as I'm sure you have noticed, bread has become, like many other edible items, &#34;super-sized&#34;. I try to buy the smallest sized bread I can, with mixed success. Unfortunately, when I tried to make french toast using the loaf I last bought it created a problem. To get 4 slices in the pan I had to resort in &#34;shoe-horning&#34;, with the slices totally filling the pan in all 4 dimensions. This became a particular problem when it came time to turn the slices, which tend to be fragile. I would characterize these bread slices as medium sized by today's standards, so it would be easy to buy (commercial) bread that would only allow a single slice to fit in the pan.<br /><br />The skillet may be fine for most applications, but not french toast or grilled sandwiches unless you are very careful about the size of the bread that you buy."
915,5,nice little scale. It is helping me keep track of how much protein I am eating daily
916,3,"The double walled glass is wonderful, but the lid ruins the potential of this product.  The lid is cheap plastic and it defeats the purpose of the insulating properties of double walled glass.  It reminds me of the cheap plastic lids that come on Italian dressing carafes.  The white flip-top is made of rubber that will likely absorb odors.  The glass portion is actually very nice...but the lid is a let-down."
917,3,Works well with standard knives but struggles to hold my meat clever sometimes.
918,1,"My initial impressions of this cutter were very favorable. It has a big, sharp wheel and comfortable grip, and cuts pizza very well - while it lasts.    And that's the problem: This thing is not very well made at all. I got it to replace an old pizza cutter that I'd had for years, which was getting dull and rusty and the wheel was no longer completely round. I went with OXO because I'd had good experiences with some of their other products, but this may be the last thing I get from them, ever. The rivet through the wheel became loose within about 6 months, causing the wheel to wobble, and it came apart completely after less than a year, and so far I haven't found a way to get it back together and tight again. Very poor quality product; the much cheaper pizza wheel that it replaced had lasted for at least 10 or 15 years, but I got less than a year out of this supposedly superior and definitely more expensive product. OXO quality appears to have taken a nose dive in recent years.    Avoid this product. Probably just about every other pizza wheel on the market is better."
919,5,Wonderful scale that works as advertised. Clear on white top with LCD screen. Thanks for the useful product for in the kitchen.
920,5,"the best hot/cold cup I have ever used!!! Especially nice for cold water....it stays cold for the day. Coffee stays pretty hot too, so you have to be careful when taking your first few sips.<br />Of course, the only drawback is that the twist off top rubber seal can slip off & then you have spilled hot coffee on your lap. I have not yet replaced that seal, because I don't use the cup that often.....but I would think that needs to be done more often if used daily."
921,4,Cute and nice napkins
922,5,it  friends and family. As I said I could not say enough good things about this product. Other than wish I had room for another one.would take me hours they all the good things about this product. I found it to be one of the greatest products ever purchased it adds a second oven to my at home.
923,5,Simply The Best Ice Cream You Will Ever Taste.
924,5,I purchased this item and am pleased.  I wanted to get away from plastic to reduce the toxins and this has been a perfect fit.
925,1,"I am so disappointed with this sealer I'm pissed. It fails out nearly every time. It wont seal anything that has any moisture. Why is it doing this?<br /><br />My Food saver is much better and I have resorted back to it, but I don't like it either.  I don't feel I should pay for return shipping and I want a refund. If you stand behind the products you sell, you should also offer a no hassle refund which includes free return shipping."
926,1,"After working wonderfully for several weeks, now half of the waffle sticks to the pan and is impossible to remove."
927,5,"This is a nice juicer for the money. I loved juicing with it, I just hated the clean up. Would def recommend this to someone looking to buy a nice juicer"
928,5,Is very nice.  Fits perfectly.
929,5,"Was given this set as a gift, and will definitely be getting some as gifts for my Harley rider friends! Awesome quality. Using one now and my beer is ice cold and my hand is toasty and dry! Looking forward to using them on the upcoming chilly winter nights while hanging out with friends ;*) And next summer to keep mine and my friends' beers cold! Cute and different gift idea for the harley rider, camper, hunter, or beer aficionado in your life."
930,5,"My kids are totally crazy about these, they love to drink from Mason Jars. Now their Mason Jar glasses are Sippy Cups."
931,4,"It does the job, doesn't exactly shake my world, but I don't expect that it should.  It doesn't feel like the most durable strainer ever, but I'm content with it, and for the price I'll keep an extra in the cupboard for future.  I like it better than the bulky OXO strainer I had previously, which ended up coming apart long before it should have shown signs of wear."
932,5,I always wanted measuring spoons that were specific to my recipes now I have them and they are awesome. ..
933,5,"The Spode Harvest Turkey Tureen is absolutely beautiful!  It is large, yet very elegant.  I presently have the tureen as decoration on my sofa table until Thanksgiving where it will grace my table."
934,5,"My wife loves it and in my mind that is all the recommendation I will ever need as I bought this for her primary use. Having said that I also tried it and found it to be as nice and easy to use as she did, so I have to add I like it alot as well. Nice unit, heats water quickly, and is easy to pour and handle, I like the placement of the off/on switch on the handle, very easy to use. It would be hard to beat for the price."
935,5,I bought this for my son.  He loves it.  He is always making rice and steaming his vegetables on top while the rice is cooking.  It has been about 9 months and it is still working fine.
936,3,"On the plus side is the price,  control for how brown you want the waffle and it get hot very quickly.  The waffles are very thin and small.  My initial opinion is that they are too thin to have a decent taste.  I will try to update this in a couple of weeks after the second use."
937,4,"The mug is beautiful. The only thing I dislike about it was that it is a little too big. I missed the 17 ounce size in the description when I purchased it for my mom. She drinks coffee all day, but only a little bit at a time. If this were a 10 ounce or 12 ounce cup, it would be perfect! The 17 ounce is just a bit heavy for her. However, if you are a person who loves larger sized mugs...then this is a perfect mug for you! (Assuming your a mom... of course! LOL)"
938,5,Worked better than I expected!
939,5,"I got these to replace a set of poultry scissors I misplaced and cannot find. I’d had that other pair for decades. Now, I’m happy I lost them. These new Culina poultry shears are actually a lot easier for me to use than my old shears. That’s important because I’m getting older and my grip is not what it used to be.<br /><br />They are well-engineered with a comfortable gripping handle and a latch to secure the blades when storing them. They are titanium-coated which provides corrosion resistance and antibacterial protection. That titanium coating also makes them very easy to clean.<br /><br />These poultry shears are also designed to work well at cracking whole lobsters and crab shells., but I doubt I’ll be preparing any of those foods at home anymore so I won’t be able to test that function.<br /><br />I’m positively delighted with these new shears! I’m going to be cooking a lot more whole chickens in the future now that I have an effective pair of poultry shears that work well in my aging grip. And now as an added bonus, when my husband brings home long-stemmed red roses for me, I won’t have to go out to the garden shed to get garden shears to clip the ends before arranging them in a vase…I’ll have these poultry shears already handy in the kitchen. Hmmm? Maybe I should look in the garden shed for that old pair of missing poultry shears.<br /><br />I’m going to make sure I don’t loose these…or they don’t end up migrating to the garden shed."
940,5,Nice quality paper liners for the pour over coffee water! Thanks
941,5,"These no-spill travel mugs are great!  I can trust it in my workbag even if it falls over.  If I had realized in advance that the silver ones could go into the dishwasher but not the other ones, I may have only bought the silver ones.  But I have to admit I really like how the colors looks. I had a blue one previously and now I like the green one."
942,5,"The Rosle Egg Cracker is my saving grace at the English breakfast ritual. It cleanly punctures and scores the egg, precisely as it is supposed to in one or two \\""whacks\\"". Well done!"
943,5,works great!
944,5,I love the different colors and love how easy they were to fill and then pop out of the silicone balls. MY daughter loved filling them and making colorful!
945,5,Keep drinks gold for long time
946,5,It was perfect for the retirement luncheon.
947,5,"Length of use so far: 2 months, holding up as if it were brand new.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Large enough to hold 1 medium and 1 small tupperware and a milk box - very big<br />- Seems to hold cold very well<br />- Colors are very bright<br />- Very sturdy - zipper is reliable, stitching is done very well.<br /><br />Cons<br />- Would be nice to have a name tag area, but that's easy to remedy with a small luggage tag"
948,5,Pretty color and works wonderfully. Very pleased with this purchase.
949,2,"The inner piece that is to be used as a stopper is a bit cumbersome. It is mostly in the way because it isn't attached to the strainer. You have to keep it in the strainer because if you remove it, the strainer holes are too wide and will let food and debris pass through and down into your drain---making it useless. So, you leave it in, but then it fits so snug that the running water takes a bit longer to drain down the sink, causing a large collection in the sink basin."
950,1,"I am filled with rage against this machine! I have other Keurig's at my vacation houses, so I bought this one for my own home. Being from Louisiana, I was thrilled that Community coffee makes capsules for Keurig use. Only, not THIS Keurig! Only coffees with a K inside of a circle and a check mark work in this computerized coffee machine.i called the company and was told that I could drive to a Bed, Bath and Beyond to find over 200 approved coffee brands, all of which taste horrible.:Gloria Jeans, Tullys, Donut Shoppe, GAG! So, I promised them that I would spread the word about Keurig and their licensing agreements with companies, designing a machine especially made to force you into buying their approved coffees, at an almost 200 dollar price tag, to boot! DO NOT BUY THIS COFFEEMAKER!"
951,4,replaced an egg cooker we had for 46 yrs with this model.  Nice and compact;  fits into a small place in my cupboard.  Eggs came out perfectly!  Good buy.
952,4,Works really well. Wish it held a little more but it's kinda heavy for it's size already.
953,5,Love it and it hold the shell in place perfectly.
954,5,It is a bit smaller than I thought but I was not paying attention to be measurement. But everything else is good:) very shoot with my purchase
955,5,"Excellent pan, excellent results"
956,5,"Probably the easiest griddle/crepe iron I have ever used, I dont think you could get a crepe to stick to it if you tried and mind you this is without any oil or butter.  We use it to make pancakes as well.  I did try doing sunnyside up eggs on it but without success.  Buy one and enjoy the crepes!"
957,4,Very nice! Will order more.
958,3,Smells like burning plastic but made my black rice okay. Had to add 3 of the cups to one half cup of rice.
959,1,I love the concept but this thing is not well made. I got through about 5 apples before the little plastic teeth started breaking off of the gears. Now it won't turn at all. Maybe I got a defective one? I regret buying this product and wish that I had spent an extra $15 for a metal apple peeler.
960,4,Ok
961,5,Works as described.  No longer fighting coffee filters.
962,5,Love the canning set
963,5,Perfect match for the Golden Harvest Mason Jar mug.
964,5,My father in law loved this and said it was the best travel mug he has ever received.
965,4,"Good product. It came in very handy to spiral my carrots into a fresh salad last night.  It is a little awkward to hold, and that is the only reason I am giving it four stars instead of five. Although I am hopeful that with more practice it will be come much easier for me to hold onto.  It is very easy to clean and the little brush that comes with it makes it even that much easier for a quick clean up.  I like that it is not a huge accessory that I have to find a place for in my already stuffed cupboards.  I am super excited to try on squash and make noodles for some yummy fresh spaghetti sauce that I have made from the harvest of my garden.  All in all a good product for the price and I would recommend it."
966,5,I love baking muffins but the cupcake liners I use always stick to the muffins which leads to unattractive muffins.  This pan is amazing.  The muffins literally just pop out.  I never thought I would be able to make a cupcake or muffin without a liner.  Best purchase I have made in a long time.
967,5,Well worth having.  Get several if you intend to use locking bucket lids on your buckets and drums.
968,4,"It feels great on my feet. I think the value is ok. I'm using it for my standing desk at work and it's eased soreness from standing in my feet most of the working day. My only issue is that it moves around too much, but that could be due to placing it on carpet."
969,1,Cheap returning
970,5,"I love this little drainer. Before this i had one that stood on the counter but since our child showed interest in it, i knew its time to remove it while he still hasnt got his little hands on it. This drainer sits low in our sink so he cant pull it, i still try not to leave glass dishes and cups inside for long period but it does the job perfectly. Its small but still large enough to keep our dishes, i also like the utensils holder because i switch and put it in the far back so it cant be reached. Its adjustable so it will fit most sinks. And i havent had rust problem so far.<br /><br />Overall -- i like this product a lot and i recommend it if you like something that doesnt stick out in ur kitchen and still gets the job done"
971,5,very cute
972,1,round item not handy with storage. larger bottles do not fit.
973,5,thank you!
974,5,"Surprised by their GREAT quality!! We blew these balloons up (to test how long and how well they held air) and attached them to balloon cups (instead of simply tying them) ... they lost no air ... 2 weeks and counting!! By doing the test run, checking their air-retention, we knew we would be able to blow up -what seemed to be- a zillion balloons, previous to the actual birthday party. I ordered several shades of green and am THRILLED with the product! =D"
975,5,"This is a great decorative mug, but I've never drank out of it and don't plan to."
976,5,"I didn't even have to read directions... it's that easy to use, and makes cooking veggies a breeze.  Great stocking stuffer too!!"
977,5,product as expected
978,5,Great product with multiple section.
979,5,Very useful to have at home. Sharpens knives in a jiffy! Passes my tomato cutting test :-P
980,5,I ordered two of these tubs. They were exactly what I was looking for - perfect size and shape. They also arrived very quickly!
981,4,"Nice box and it packs flat to fit in most bags. It does not seal fully though, the container inside seals ok but the box itself is very loose when shut. The design is nice but product needs improvement in its construction."
982,5,"A little shaky if you're using for anything very heavy,  but this stand makes a pretty statement!"
983,5,This is the cutest set of measuring spoons ever!! They are very cheerful and I love them! I shared them on facebook! They work very nicely and are just adorable!! LOVE!!!
984,5,"I recently became aware of Rada Cutlery and think it's the best cutlery bargain around. Knives are very sharp, well made, easy to sharpen, feel well balanced, and made in USA.. I bought these as a gift and the recipient is extremely happy with them. I have the same set, use them all the time, and will continue to purchase Rada Cutlery based on the performance of all the Rada Cutlery I have. Note: buy the black handle if you don't like the idea of the aluminum handle not looking brand new, especially if you put it in the dishwasher."
985,5,You can chop up meat and chicken with this.
986,5,"i like it , order second at a gift for my sister"
987,5,"I am more of a hobby chef and chose this after lots of research. This is my first piece of Japanese Steel.<br /><br />Seriously the best knife at this price point. Was scarily sharp. Recommend this for someone just starting into the high quality knives.<br /><br />Not as difficult to maintain as high carbon ones, but now I need to get the waterstone to keep it honed.<br /><br />Do plan to get one if you are buying this."
988,5,Great quality mug!
989,2,Did not work very well for me. cannot recommend it.
990,4,Really enjoy this coffee maker it really keeps the coffee hot which is why we bought it.
991,5,"Love this ice cream maker.  Can't believe how easy it is to use.  Perfect for 2 people.  I make a dairy free, sugar free frozen dessert and it turns out great everytime.<br />."
992,5,I already have the Fasta Pasta and love it.  I bought 3 more for Christmas gifts.  The order arrived promptly and items were new as promised.
993,5,"I ordered this for my husband who is a teppanyaki chef, someone stole his first one made by Dexter, and he could not settle with any other. After searching forever here it is and its same quality as the one bought from restaurant supply store. I was very satisfied with my purchase and will buy again if needed."
994,5,looks really good
995,5,Great birthday gift for my friend.  She loved it!
996,5,Great product! Easy to use.
997,5,"Solid piece of equipment. Surprisingly heavy. Upper milk chamber has a non-stick surface. Makes a good froth from whole milk in less than a minute. For one cup of coffee I have been filling the upper chamber with just enough milk to cover the circular whisk. Depending on how long you let it run, the milk will vary from a rich cream-like consistency to an airy froth. It is almost noiseless. Using the heating element produces milk at just the right temperature. Excellent product."
998,5,I actually purchased this popcorn popper to roast coffee and it does a real good job at it.  I'm new to roasting coffee and had read many reviews on how people are using popcorn poppers to roast coffee.  Other stores are selling this same popper for $10-$20 higher and calling it a coffee roaster.  The heavier pot in this version is nice and it feels substantial in the hand.  My only complaint with the popper/roaster is the handle.  The handle is connected to the pot by what appears to be a small piece of aluminum.  The weight of the stainless steel pot alone makes the aluminum bend when picking the pot up off of the stove by the wood handle.  I am glad a purchased the pot and have already roasted eight batches of coffee beans.
999,5,This item was delivered super fast and is working above my expectations. I love this thing!  Definately will buy from these guys again!
1000,5,"This nut bag is large, 12\\"" x 12\\"". It's strong, made from food grade, commercial,  BPA free nylon. It has strong seams & a drawstring to hang for sprouting and quick drying.<br /><br />I used this bag a few times to make cold brewed coffee.  I used recipes & procedures I found online. I thought I would really like cold brewed coffee, but wasn't overly impressed. I need to tweak the  coffee/water ratio.  Ellie's Nut Milk Bag made the process simple for me & straining the grounds was easy. No coffee grounds escaped the nut milk bag. When I was finished, I washed the bag by hand, did not use bleach only dishwashing liquid.  The coffee stained the bag, but that's okay with me.<br /><br />My hubby used to drink 1/2 gallon of milk a day.  Now he's gluten & dairy intolerant.  He drinks Vanilla Almond Milk now.  I plan on making some for him when I get some almonds.<br /><br />This nut milk bag is versatile.<br />Uses:<br />Sprouting...Soak sprouting seeds for desired time and hang to dry in the bag.<br />Steeping loose leaf tea<br />Making cheeses<br />Almond milk, etc<br />Making cold brew coffee<br />Juicing<br />As a fine mesh strainer<br />and more<br /><br />Be sure to download Ellie's free e-book for recipes.

1001,5,"This aerator is wonderful!!  Purchased it approximately 2 weeks ago after returning from our vacation to Sonoma and touring our share of vineyards.  I haven't poured a glass of wine here at home without it!  It most definitely enhances the bouquet and wine tasting experience!  The packaging is elegant as well.  I purchased a 2nd one to give as a birthday gift to my brother-in-law, a real wine connoisseur !  (Btw, we even brought it with us to one of our favorite BYOB restaurants last weekend.  Easy to slip into the pouch and it was set on the table in It's holder for our friends to pour and enjoy as well.  I gave this product 5 stars!"
1002,5,Perfect office mate. Excellent for storing yogurt and Illy caffe espresso.
1003,4,"I'd have given this a five star rating if it wasn't broken on the rim of the lid. I like it so much I'm going to super glue the piece back in even though the seal seats without the missing piece. I got the last one, at least for now. If they get more in stock I'll probably buy a few more. I'm getting started in low carb baking and that calls for a number of ingredients."
1004,5,Great pot.
1005,3,good
1006,4,"The best small/medium hand-held citrus juicer I have found so far.  Heavy!  Good handle length for good leverage to make easy squeezing. We go through about a half dozen lemons and limes a week then was run through the dishwasher on the pots and pans cycle almost every day since we got it and it still looks brand new.    It's not stamped from a cheap sheet of metal but seems to be molded/cast which was surprising for stainless steel.    My eighty year-old mother says it is *too* heavy, but uses it all of the time adding that it will definitely outlast her and probably me too!  My only slight issue is that the lower handle of mine has a very shallow dent in it but it doesn't affect its usability. (Good grief! I cannot imagine how they could have dented this thing!  I don't think running over the handle with a HumVee would dent it.)    I was very hesitant to detract a star for its weight and the dent so it's really just a half-star off.  (The weight component is a two-edged sword)    Would I buy this again or recommend it to a friend? Absolutely!  As long as I could still lift it!"
1007,1,Way too expensive for a LEAKY lunchbox! My kids were so upset when the juice from their grapes and oranges leaked all over their bread (who wants soggy bread?) They came home starving. You stink Rubbermaid!
1008,5,Perfect pasta fork!
1009,5,"I was shopping online for my boys and stumbled upon the the curious chef cooking items and I am in love!  They are better than what I use myself.  I have picky eaters and I am hoping that if they prepare their own food that they are more likely to eat it.  I ordered the 27 piece foundation set, the curious chef 6 piece fruit and veggie prep kit, additional mixing bowls in various sizes, and the knives.  The bowl looks to be very well made and sturdy.  We are going to get a lot of use out of our Curious Chef items.  Thank you for making such a great product!!!"
1010,5,Great
1011,5,Beautiful set
1012,5,Fabulous!!! Perfect eggs every time!
1013,4,"I used it for a pencil dispenser. I wish it had a larger opening because if erasers get bent, the pemcils get stuck. Also the lid frequently gets stuck. The track could be larger. All in all it was pretty much as advertised."
1014,5,"Very nice, keeps the grains from getting through.  Easy to just wash out and dispose of."
1015,5,Great pan!  It cooks very well.  I use it to make breakfast everyday.  I've had it for a while  and there's not even<br />a scratch on it yet!
1016,5,Very impressive ....I love it
1017,5,"Love this toaster, toast comes out evenly brown every time. The best thing is the little timer that tells you when the toast will be done."
1018,3,"I purchased this as a funny little gift for a friend, so it was disappointing to receive it without a the box that is shown in the description. Perhaps that was because I ordered it as an add-on item? I can still give it as a gift, but without the box it will be a lot less fun."
1019,5,"This pot works just as expected, reliable. Use it frequently, no comaints. Appreciate that the steam weight is removable. Gasket fits easy into groove and sime to remove and clean. I am a satisfied customer."
1020,5,"Perfect!  Great price, fast shipping, excellent product!"
1021,5,"Absolutely top quality!!  Very heavy-duty, will last for many years to come.  Looks cool, too."
1022,1,The figures specifically show that you can use two molds at the same time however the distance between the prongs on the tool you receive is too small to fit two molds at the same time.....even though it's shown.
1023,5,"I have only used the finer plate so far, and this works very well for making mashed potatoes.  I can't believe I've waited so long to buy one - huge difference.  Beating with your mixer makes gluey potatoes - ricing with this gadget makes light and fluffy potatoes!"
1024,5,Love them
1025,5,Does the job nicely.  Easy to use and kids can help with it!
1026,5,Wonderful!  I can open cans without &#34;missing&#34; spots.  Heavy duty and easy to use.
1027,5,"Excellent!!! I absolutely love it!! The package wrapping was done very nicely to keep the stein fully protected, I'm very satisfied with this purchase!"
1028,5,great product
1029,1,"not as heavily constructed as the others I bought in the past, but doable!"
1030,4,"Took a little while to receive,  but it's a sturdy little guy.  Would buy again."
1031,5,"Light, convenient, keeps the drink hot!"
1032,5,Satisfied😀
1033,1,Rarely penetrates the entire peel.
1034,5,"I really like this little tool.  I use it to make lemonade, and it is quick with zero mess or spills.  Very basic, no frills and gets the job done fast."
1035,5,Love this lunch container. Fits snugly in the PackIt Freezable lunch bag. Stays cool in the lunch bag. To divide food I also use silicone liners. A great container but I wouldn't put &#34;runny&#34; foods in it as it does not seem like it's leakproof. My daughter is 2 and this is a perfect size for a sandwich and fruit & veggies. Dishwasher top rack safe. Better than plastic!!!
1036,5,Right out of the box- I immediately used it to grind/strain a BUSHEL of tomatoes.  Wow - awesome!  So  much better than hand cranking for hours! I have a very very old Kitchenaid with an equally old meat grinder (which this attaches to).  This did not attach to the metal meat grinder - but my husband was able to make a few modifications and it worked perfectly (he had to grind a few notches off of this as well as a few parts from the meat grinder).
1037,5,"I don't use this mold for cookie houses, but for making Paper Crete fairy houses."
1038,4,"Nice size, does its duty. Overpriced."
1039,4,It is all they said it was. Enjoying that it takes less space on my cabinet.
1040,5,"It's so convenient to cook dishes and taste so good~~<br /><br />It's quite easy to clean, BTW."
1041,5,"It is just simple, high quality and extremely handy. Works great on my stovetop and gas. But what amazes me more, is its elegant italian design with the polished aluminum finish. And that's what makes it different from all others! Highly recommended."
1042,4,simple functional pan
1043,5,"One of my favorite pieces of cookware.  Nice size for 2 to 4 people.  Love the glass top, the side handles, and the pour spouts on the side.  Everything you could ask for in a hefty-weight stainless steel cookware item."
1044,1,"Ordered Yellow, received dark gray."
1045,5,"I have always been very happy with my Cuisinart products and this one did not disappoint. Well designed, high quality material. Easy to clean with simple cord storage on unit. Made great waffles. Once the waffle iron reached correct cooking temperature, the waffles cooked very quickly. Arrived on projected delivery date. Thank you Amazon and all parties involved."
1046,3,Makes a decent tasting cup of coffee.  I don't like the water fill or the design of the carafe.  The edge makes it difficult to poor the last of the coffee without spilling.  The water fill is too small.  I would also like the coffee to come out hotter.
1047,5,OK COOKER.
1048,5,It was the best gift for a person who LOVES the camel!  And her birthday was on a WEDNESDAY...Ha!
1049,5,We bought 2.  They work well.
1050,3,Smaller than I though
1051,5,Best mug ever! Perfect weight and feel! Keeps coffee nice and hot!
1052,1,"I agree with the other review.  These bags are VERY THIN.  80 microns= 4 mil, I don't think so.  I'm using conversion tables and I can't find one that gives those numbers, but, if someone can show me that conversion as a fact, I'd appreciate it. I got this:<br />80 mil =3.1496063 mil."
1053,5,"No problems from My K-cup Reusable, I will be ordering another one. Just for back-up."
1054,5,Perfect size for a child's (2 year old) hands.
1055,4,This is a terrific product for when you're having more than one and will probably forget who you are eventually.
1056,3,"As a skillet, it works pretty well.  Mine is domed a little so any liquid I add such as butter, oil, etc runs to the edges and stays there.  As a general rule, I try to NOT buy items made in China, and nowhere in the info on this site did it mention country of origin.  It was only when I received the merchandise that I saw it was Chinese.  I doubt I would buy it again just for that reason."
1057,5,"great product fast shipping had a big pot of beans ,cornbread and fried potatos nexted day"
1058,5,"Best water bottles I have purchased ever!  Easy to use for kids, easy to clean, spill free 100%, great price!  Love them! Have bought them twice already as my kids have lost them in school, don't mind paying for these as opposed to the double priced ones."
1059,5,Love these.  Large enough to hold a huge amount of ice and an entire can of coke but not so large that you can't keep a grip on them.  The straws are nice and sturdy too.  Packing was minimal but good enough to keep them intact.  Have ordered myself another set and a set for another family member.
1060,5,I like
1061,3,"I am giving this only 3 stars because the ladle I received was NOT 12 inches long, but barely nine inches long.  Having stated that, I am keeping it because it is well made and, as it turns out, I have a use for one this size.  Because of the quality, I would still like to order another one in a much larger size, but hesitant to try again."
1062,5,Great deal<br />Love it
1063,5,Love these glasses!  Just the right size for small drinks.  Wonderful quality.
1064,3,This is a good cup professional quality. It was recommended for purchase with the Breville BSB510XL but it does not work with that Immersion blender. The breville is too big to go to the bottom of the cup.
1065,5,I purchased the Rada peeler first and then decided to try the starter set.  I love it and use it all the time.  Just handle with care so you don't cut yourself!  Love this product!
1066,1,Not as pictured. Was a totally different item. Had to send it back for a refund. Amazon customer service did an excellent job.
1067,5,Beautiful and functional
1068,3,Appear to fit a little loose and come off easily.
1069,4,I used these air locks on a project and they worked perfect thanks  amazon.
1070,5,"I got 6 forks with my Fondue set , so why not get 6 more ( I don't like waiting )."
1071,5,LOVE this grinder. Love that the insert comes out.  Love the different speeds and timer.  What I especially love is that this grinder is powerfull enough to grind just about anything I want to turn into powder.  And....it lasted at least 10 years before finally giving out on me. I am totally buying this grinder again.
1072,5,"Love these pitchers! I've been using infuser bottles for several months now, but wanted something for my at-home days. This well-made pitcher is attractive enough to leave out on the counter during the day, and holds enough water that I don't have to add water with every cup I pour out."
1073,5,My granddaughter loves this tumbler and I like it because it never leaves a ring on my tables.
1074,5,I didn't realize how much I'd use these gallon bags. They're made really well so you can wash and reuse them.
1075,5,Really nice i always like glass tea kettles
1076,5,Great!
1077,5,thanks
1078,5,I love this and it really keeps my brown sugar soft.  It also holds a full bag so that is beneficial too.
1079,5,Loving it!
1080,5,"Seems comparable to other candy molds I have. I was able to fill, freeze and release chocolate without any problems."
1081,5,I use this all the time. It is a breeze to use and makes perfect tea every time. Love it.
1082,5,great great great great great
1083,4,"I had a smaller version of this product years ago. I am having a little trouble getting the hang of this one, but it produces the same delicious expresso when I follow some suggestions that I found on line."
1084,5,Perfect. Been used for half- sour pickles. Small enough to go  directly from counter to icebox.
1085,5,Everything I thought it would be
1086,5,"He looks pretty good . He does not have shoes but a bunch of Farm Folks may not be wearing shoes at the time they are impaled by a pitch fork. His feet move a bit so that is likely why the promo pic used shoes . Some tent stakes will work fine to secure him though from windy nights and old shoes could be used . He is pretty skinny but he is a rotting corpse after all . We can work with him and for the money spent , he is a good Halloween prop . If you want pro quality you would pay a whole lot more . He is good enough for a haunted house though and with good set design and lighting , he'll work great ."
1087,5,This is really cute and good quality for the price paid. A great bargin for a one time use. LOVE IT!
1088,5,"Ok so far I’ve been very happy with my purchase. The spatulas have a high quality feel, which is refreshing for a relatively low cost item.<br /><br />They are super easy to clean and I love the fact that there are two of the large spatulas. I find I use these ones significantly more than the rest and so it comes in handy having a spare when the other one’s in the dishwasher!<br /><br />For now they maintain their pristine look, but only time will tell whether they will stay looking this way! Overall would highly recommend these to anyone in the market for some new Spatulas."
1089,5,These knives are really great. Highly recommend
1090,1,Cheaply made. I wish I hadn't bought them a waste of my money I bought two sets I don't have one glass left!
1091,5,Wonderful little product and the seller was awesome. Quick delivery and a nice promotion.
1092,5,works great
1093,4,Comfortable enough. The bride wore it all night. She seemed to like it.
1094,5,The replacement made a big difference in the performance of my juicer.
1095,5,Perfect for outdoor Mexican Fiesta themed party
1096,5,Great grinds! Quiet! This is an expensive but wonderful grinder. Totally worth it.
1097,5,this is amazing! its a little heavy but burgers taste great on this! cleaning up is pretty easy too!
1098,3,Came with cracks and flakes of paint near the trigger.
1099,5,Great quality.
1100,5,Very easy to use.
1101,5,Just the right size for easy storage.  Love the ability to control temperatures on this model.  Very satisfied.
1102,5,Great for refrigerated items
1103,5,"Awesome! Love these. Items arrived quickly, packaged well, accurate description, would do business again A++"
1104,5,Good looking and easy to read measurements.
1105,5,The easiest way to prepare lasagna
1106,1,"Didn't cut my homemade bread evenly, ever"
1107,1,Did not do what I thought it would.
1108,5,"Looks nice, smooth at opening cans, just works."
1109,4,Works great.  Fits nicely in the 1.5 qt pan I use most but will also spread to fill a larger pan.  Only complain is that it's difficult to get ahold of the center ring.
1110,4,Have previously owned a bread machine years ago and decided to purchase this one because of the great reviews. Returned this one with Amazon's easy returns since it had scratches. Looked like a good bread machine and seemed sturdy.
1111,3,"I gave it as a gift, I have no idea whether it was good or bad."
1112,5,Bought this as a gift for my big brother and he loves it! It is a fun mug with bold colors. It is sturdy and was a good value.
1113,5,I really like the bowls.  The grip makes the bowl easier to use.  The color of the lids match my kitchen colors.
1114,5,I don't know why I waited so long to buy this thing. It's seriously amazing. Light years beyond any blender I've ever purchased previously.
1115,4,Perfect for my household needs. Ordered as a replacement after the original cracked. Fits the base I already had perfectly. No complaints.
1116,5,"I bought this for my husband for his birthday.  He has nearly dehydrated everything in our home but water.  Works great, great price and the only thing we need is to pick up a timer so it can turn off when done.  Zero complaints!!"
1117,4,Good quality steel mug for the price. Recommended.<br /><br />Henry
1118,5,Love it!
1119,4,This double grill pan works well.  It heats evenly ok and it is easy to clean.<br />I can cook a lot of meat in one batch and it cuts my cooking time in half.<br />The grill marks aren't that great but that is not important to me.
1120,3,"A bit more clunky and oversized than I had hoped they would be, but nicely smooth and pretty to look at.  Wish they had had a thinner edge on their design, and that their handles had been a bit shorter, but they look to be strong."
1121,5,"This arrived very quickly! Also, King Tritan is on the other side of the Little Mermaid so you're actually getting two photo props in one!"
1122,5,"Bought 2 & love them. Wide enough mouth to add ice, water stays cold for long period of time, dropped numerous times & didn't break like plastic does & love the built-in straw."
1123,5,"Wow. I could not be happier with this coffee maker. We purchased it after a great deal of research and found all of the positive assessments to be true: it is quiet, fast, and makes the best coffee we have had. We love having the thermal carafe instead of a heating plate, as we take the pot with us to the deck. It keeps coffee hot for hours. The large water reservoir is much easier to fill than other coffee makers I've owned.<br /><br />I was concerned by the reviews that said the glass carafe shattered, but having owned this maker for many months, I now am skeptical of those reviews. Although I initially treated the glass interior with great care, honestly, now I rinse it thoughtlessly and have had no problems whatsoever."
1124,2,Lets the coffee grains through!
1125,5,Great quality wok at very nice price.
1126,3,"This is an insulated metal thermos. I received a complimentary sample to test for my review.<br /><br />I actually didn't believe it was insulated - it felt like just metal to me - I filled it with very hot water. I was very surprised after a few minutes that there was no feel of heat in the area around the sides. I did notice it was warm at the top, so there was a heat loss there, but not a major one.<br /><br />There is a double mechanism to hold the top closed, a clip and a push button which ensures this won't come undone accidentally. Once you open the lid, it has two holes, an air and a pour hole. The liquid comes out into the area where you drink it. This permits you to allow it to cool slightly or sip it as it comes out.<br /><br />It is a nice concept, but I noticed a couple of issues in implementation. The first involved the carry clip on the top. Mine arrived in the box broken. A piece of the hinge was missing. It made me worry about the sturdiness of the other clip, the one that held it closed.<br /><br />The second involved the fact that I found drinking out of it awkward with the placement of the button and with the top folded back,<br />especially with the broken holding clip.<br /><br />This really needs to be hand washed in order to ensure that all of the areas are fully cleaned because of the construction.<br /><br />I have given this three stars - it is OK, because of these small issues."
1127,5,"the same quality as most other reuseable shopping bags.  Will last a while, but not a life-time."
1128,5,"makes good coffee in short time ,easy to clean  well made"
1129,5,I was worried about this product after reading the reviews about it being flimsy and easily broken. Mine arrived in good condition. The door is very light but I do not feel that it will break under normal usage.<br />It is nice looking and the top is study enough to hold our electric can opener and scentsy wax burner. All in all I would recommend this bread bin.
1130,5,"This is by far the best travel mug ever invented. This keeps coffee hot for hours and will never ever spill a drop. I actually placed this mug in my purse after filling with hot coffee and not one drop spilled or leaked out. I have had several other travel mugs  in the past that had to  be wrapped in plastic because it was a guarantee it would leak, which proved to be a waste of money, and a complete mess.This is one of the best purchses i have made ever. I can take my own delish coffee to work to enjoy. I have recommended this to several friends who are of the same opinion. Dont hesitate in purchasing this, you wont be disappointed."
1131,5,As described and fast delivery.
1132,5,"Been learning to smoke meats and doing some trussing, I have gone thru my last one of these same size same stuff. Works great"
1133,4,"Great for the price! Tends to get a little loud and starts to smell like the motor is running hard... But I've only used it for at most 2 smoothies in a row so I don't know how it holds up for constant use, but for personal use it's perfect!"
1134,4,It is a nice size and works well!
1135,5,What I expected
1136,5,Perfect!
1137,5,I lightly floured the surface and then put my pizza dough on it and topped my pizza.  It effortlessly transferred my pizza to the preheated pizza stone already in the oven.  Used a little water to clean the surface and lightly oiled it for storage.  I would recommend this to anyone that likes making their own pizza at home.
1138,5,These matched my kitchen decor perfect.Look great on my range.I am very pleased with these and am happy to say I could recommend this product to any one if it matches your decor.Great service thanks again Amazon.
1139,5,love it
1140,5,NOT YET RECEIVED.
1141,5,"I have used this quality pan for pizza for 7 years now. When last using it I pondered the fact that most of the cooking supplies(Amazon) that I have bought since then I really don't much use, but now this makes me an Italian mama who can make extraordinary pizza with the best of them. Have had no problems with the handles but is heavy (good) and can get super hot for a crisp crust. I just thought of another Amazon item, that is indespensible for pizza, the Zorirushi bread maker (2011) that turns out the dough. time to make pizza again to confirm my comments!"
1142,5,Works great!  Gets a fine grind.
1143,5,Neat look.
1144,2,Save your money!  Looks like something made in a boy's wood shop.  Does not press evenly or thin enough.  I've used this product twice.  I still had to use my rolling pin to even out the tortilla and make it thin enough.
1145,5,Fits in drawer right and holds all of my knives. Great way to organize them. Very nice product
1146,5,Perfect
1147,5,Best couple dollars I have ever spent! Makes a world of difference!
1148,5,big cooker just right for me.
1149,5,"I gave this as a baby shower gift.  She Loves It!!!  It was a unique gift that was not on her list, but she is very conscious of healthy foods and saving money.  It all came in a single box - easy to wrap."
1150,5,well made. You pay a bit more for the name and quality to find out Cuisinant  is the best. Hopefully it will last throughout my retirement and compliment all the Wushoff products I have
1151,5,Use this every day at work.  Keeps water cool for a while and I like the large size -- encourages drinking more water!
1152,5,Came sharp and was just what I was looking for.  Like this knife a lot and love the santoku blade.  Grip could look better but functions great.  Blade looks and functions great.
1153,5,"Was a little smaller than I was thinking, but that's my fault! Great quality and very nice design and colors. Goes very well in a rustic style kitchen, colors are represented well in the picture. Has small rubber feet underneath which make this cutting board impossible to slide, so it stays secure on your countertop."
1154,5,I love these because my grandson is learning to use real utensils. I hate those plastic kids forks that are easy to hold but don't pick up the food.
1155,5,"I've been using this cup for a few months now and it still doesn't leak and keeps beverages nice and hot(too hot actually, I usually leave the lid off for a little bit to cool my coffee down first, because if you put boiling hot coffee in this thing and slap the lid on it expect to burn your tongue off 20 minutes later).<br /><br />I'm not sure what else could be said, it's a cup after all. It's still shaped like a cup and holds liquids."
1156,5,"This set is just what I have been looking for in ceramic knives. First of all what I like is that it has three knives AND an also a attractive stand for kitchen counter display (how hand is this)!<br /><br />What I like about this set:<br /><br />1) All three of the knives serve the purpose I want them to serve: The paring knife does a fine job of paring apples and even peeling potatoes! The utility knife is perfect for slicing tomatoes and smaller onions with ease. The largest knife (smaller Chef knife) is just right for slicing, dicing medium to large onions, celery, carrots etc.<br /><br />2) Handles on these knifes are countoured to my fingers and they are easy to hold and I found them slip proof!<br /><br />3) Sharpness of these knives much sharper than my old steel set of knives and no sharpening needed!<br /><br />4) Easy to clean these knives – I sliced cheese and meats and the foods DID NOT STICK to these knives, so easy to clean!<br /><br />Highly recommend these knives to all!"
1157,1,"Its very inaccurate cherry pitter. I tested it yesterday and I was disappointed. On ten pitted sour cherries 8 - 9 cherries was with stones. I had to remove stones by hands, so this one is even slower than cheep manual cherry pitter witch I bought in ace hardware for 3$ 3years ago. I do not recommend it to others."
1158,2,Looks beautiful but..... RUSTED after 6 months of everyday use! I emptied water out everytime but still rusted.
1159,1,I didn't get the color I had chosen.
1160,5,"awesome carafe.  it fits perfect, and pours wonderfully  :)"
1161,5,&#60;3
1162,5,Got this for my boyfriend for christmas and he was so excited.  He had a 9&#34; already so when I got him this 12&#34; we was awed at how much more food he could fit in the pan now. He loves it!
1163,1,"One of the most important attributes of any tea pot is that it does not drip when pouring. Unfortunately, that attribute eludes this tea pot. No matter how steep of an angle, the tea pot leaks.<br /><br />Poor design.<br /><br />I would not recommend this tea pot."
1164,5,Great gift!
1165,5,Works great as a spatula and seems like it will last for a long time.
1166,3,"Not quite as full as pictured, and will add elastic to band so it doesn't stretch out."
1167,5,Great price for an excellent product. It serves the exact purpose for which it was purchased. I would buy it again from this seller and have already recommended it to others.
1168,5,Great durable pint glasses!!
1169,5,A great way to heat your water and serve .  It also heats quickly so it saves a lot of time. And you do not need other pot to serve your tea.
1170,5,"I've never owned a food scale before and now have a need for one.  I read the reviews of many scales and opted for this one based on the large readout and sleek design.  When it arrived, I followed the advice from others and used a nickel to see if it read 5 grams and it did.  Its very easy to use and I love its sleek and classy design.  I'm very happy with this purchase & would recommend it."
1171,5,"Works perfectly and fits so nicely on the countertop (not too big like a lot of coffee pots) yet it still makes 12 cups of coffee and in less than 10 mins too!  My last coffee pot took 45 mins for a pot, so this was a welcome addition to our kitchen :)"
1172,5,"These are just like using real Ice Cubes. except they don't water down your drink, which is great. I also like that there is no after taste or funny bitter flavor from the cubes when there in your drink."
1173,5,I bought this to replace my wife's broken old one.  This is twice the size and it makes it very convenient especially we cook a lot of soup bones and easy to separate the fat
1174,5,"We love it.  It cooks excellently, gets hot quickly, easy cleanup. great size and  price.  We have mainly grilled vegetables, they have been terrific."
1175,1,"Looks good when new. After a couple of uses starts turning yellowish. In 1 year food sticks hard, pot becomes unusable.<br />Extremely low quality item.<br />No response from the customer support."
1176,5,"The mini blender bottle is perfect for people who don't like to add a lot of liquid to their protein shakes. After all, the point is to get it into your body to do its work, not to savor the taste! The construction is sturdy and the lid is very secure so there is no leakage. I prefer this smaller bottle over the classic size and will only use the classic size when I make an &#34;iced coffee&#34; shake."
1177,4,"works very well. does prevent oil from going everywhere. it also lets out good amount of steam so food doesn't get boiled. however it is a pain to clean, especially because it's fairly large sized. i don't think there's any way around that."
1178,1,Several segments of the LCD display did not work right out of the package.  Useless.  Returned for credit and bought a Taylor brand - which works very nicely and has more features.
1179,5,This mini muffin pan provided great non-stick results for sourdough cupcakes.  I brushed the wells with coconut oil before loading the batter and baking.  Perfect results with no off-taste.  The cupcakes came right out of the pan with only a slight push on the bottom of one or two wells to dislodge the cakes.  The only slightly downside to any silicone pan is the requirement to put the pan on pan or cookie sheet for stability.  The pluses more than compensate for this minor downside.  I also have the 12 cup muffin pan from this company which also gives great results.
1180,4,"Have had this whisk for a few months now, and has proven to be a quality product as it holds up and washes well. I would recommend this product to anyone."
1181,5,I love this blender! It does the job making smoothies and margaritas just fine. The spout is a huge bonus! I would recommend this to a friend!
1182,5,This machine is amazing a quick! I also use it to make hot chocolate and every time it comes out perfect!!
1183,5,Great set for a great price!<br />Nice sharp knives that I've had for a fees months now with no problems.
1184,4,"Tongs are a kitchen essential for anything that can't be easily removed from a pot, pan or the grill with either a spatula or spoon.  A few of my pots and pans are Teflon coated, which means being very careful when using metal tongs as you don't want to scratch the surface.<br /><br />I've been slowly replacing many of my kitchen utensils with silicone products and this one was a good choice for me.  These are more comfortable to hold with a strip of silicone along the outside of each handle than my old metal ones.  The sliding lock allows you to close them completely for storage.<br /><br />But the best feature are the silicone grips.  1-1/2 inches wide with scalloped edges, these provide a firmer grip than what I'm used to; I haven't dropped anything since getting these.  Which leads me to one of the biggest uses I have for tongs; grabbing things--mostly jars and bottles--from the top shelf of my cabinets that I'd otherwise need to haul out a step stool to reach.  I actually use them more for reach than for cooking.<br /><br />Silicone means that these will withstand temperatures of up to 480 degrees.  I've never actually tested the temperature to see if that's true, but I've never had an issue with burning or charring.  Would love to get a longer one for the grill.<br /><br />."
1185,4,Very quality construction. My drinks are kept very very cold or very very warm. It is quite comfortable to drink from as well.<br /><br />The problem is cleaning. You need a small toothbrush or something to properly clean the top. The underside of the top can be taken apart and cleaned quite easily. I usually use this as a transporting container and pour the drink into another cup for drinking. This will avoid having to clean the top very much.
1186,4,"This makes the most amazing zoodles, sweet potato noodles, and fries, so easy to use and not so bad on the clean up... A little disappointed on the slicer tho, really this is MENT for only spiral cuts, I purchased another mandolin slicer... Because this one cut too thin, and also cores at the same time so you waste a little of your produce"
1187,5,"Great product, l Iove them, breakfast, soup, whatever, dishwasher safe.  Matches my kitchen an very durable.  Glad I purchased them"
1188,5,Nice alternative to buying bottled water. I like these because they are inexpensive and the water tastes a bit better.
1189,2,"I bought this about two seasons ago and it is dead! The fan just gave out.  When it did work, it did a great job.  I won't buy this brand again."
1190,5,"It is smooth, rich and very tasty.  Makes even &#34;Meh&#34; beans stand out.  Easy to clean, easy to use, easy to Love.<br /><br />The only coffee my mother-in-law will drink without cream in it.<br /><br />Yes, it really is that good."
1191,5,"Love these little fella's. Zipper is well made so it actually holds up over time. Easy to clean, reusable, what's not to like?"
1192,5,"I wasn't crazy about the picture on these but that was all they had at the time but the quality is really nice!  These are probably the best burner covers I have ever purchased in terms of quality - in the past I have had things stick to the covers, the pictures bubble or peel off etc - not with these!"
1193,4,"I've had this for over a year now and am over all very happy with it...but the handle on the lid gets hot. That is something that other glass lid skillets I have had did not do. The silicon buffers between the handle, lid and inside screws must not be up to snuff."
1194,5,great
1195,3,It is what it is. It worked. No complaints. Used it to replace melted camping pot. Now I can boil n the bush.
1196,1,I bought it because of the size.  My others are all from Pampered Chef and they don't offer one this big.  I used it on chilled cookie dough and by the time the dough was unchilled it wasn't even usable anymore on the softer dough.  The turn mechanism is much thinner metal/steel and it wouldn't hold up to the first or final scoopings at all.  Very disappointed!
1197,5,"Love these spoons, especially for the great price. Love that they are of different lengths and I can use them for cooking or for baking. The only thing (which is not a game changer for me at least) is that when I stirred a mixture of blueberries and blackberries, one of my spoons stained purple on the top. However it may come off over several washes so waiting to see."
1198,4,"Purchased this product to use in a well that has elevated iron. Put a couple of ounces in and it seeems to be helping my water quality. My wife is also using in the wash instead of bleach. Whites become dull in our water and after a couple of washings the white sheets seem to be looking better.<br /><br />Impressed with the packaging. Product is in a large zip lock bag, which is inside another one. Keeps things dry and harder to puncture. Four stars only because I am uncertain if this will be a good well solution."
1199,4,I had no idea this scale was this big but I love it. Too bad they failed to include the invoice in my box but it was sealed well.
1200,5,"This is the 2nd item i've purchased made by this company. Really high quality stuff.<br /><br />No sharp edges, very strong product. No flexing, hard to scratch.  Should last forever."
1201,4,"This is my fault for not reading the description better, but these were small than I thought they would be. I knew they were for a toaster over (and that's what I wanted since the baking sheet that came with our toaster oven is completely shot), but I guess we must have a very large toaster since the baking sheet is only half the size of ours!<br /><br />Like I said, this is my fault for not reading the measurements and then measuring our own oven, but I figured I would leave this review in case anyone else may encounter the same problem.<br /><br />Other than that, I love having all three pieces. We use our toaster oven all the time, especially in the summer, so I know all three pieces of this set will be used quite a bit (despite their small size). They are easy to clean as well, being non-stick."
1202,4,I use this in all my drinks not just for my whisky. Just have to be a bit careful filling it up.
1203,2,i used this 3 times... it will not work anymore... worked well before it broke... i got it on clearance but it was a serious waste of money... i feel ripped off...
1204,4,it was very nice gift and  they seemed to like it . it was something that she could not find where she lived so we  got it for her.
1205,4,"The reviews posted by others indicated a variety of experiences, but so far we've had nothing but a positive one. We use ours at least twice a week and it heats evenly across the surface. And it's a breeze to clean!"
1206,4,I was very pleased with the quality of the snowflakes. They we sturdy and a great size to hang it place on the table.
1207,5,I've used it a couple of times and can't be more satisfied. It works well and the price was right..
1208,5,"looks exactly like the riedel decanter, that is much much more<br />epensive.  my husband loved it as it was a Christmas gift."
1209,4,"Perfect, just as it looks in pictures. Only wish there could've been some type of flip top or screw in top since I put oils in the bottles and I've dropped them a few times and had them spill a little bit"
1210,5,This is the first tortilla maker I've had the pleasure of buying and I have to say I'm glad I did. It's easy to use and clean. I haven't had any problems with the handle breaking but I am mindful about the pressure I apply to it. It works great. I'm just not the best at making tortillas but that's not the presses' fault. All in all I'm very happy with it.
1211,5,"Works as it should, easy to clean, owned aluminum model previously but feel the stainless option is better for health."
1212,5,We have 10 people in our family when we get together for events and it was really hard to cut cakes or pies in even slices to ensure everyone got a piece.  This solves the problem!  All of the reviews state that it is sharp and that is correct.  I kept the box it came in and put it back after it is washed and dried.
1213,5,Easier to clean and less likely to break than an glass carboy and you can see what is going on with the beer. Love the better bottle Carboy.
1214,5,These work really well in my new non stick pans.<br />I can now stir my scrambled eggs without worrying about scratching the finish.
1215,4,"This little food processor has taken alot of &#34;work&#34;out of dinner prep. It works wonderfully for onions, mixing sauces, grating zucchini. It didnt work that well for garlic cloves. It mixes oils into dressing, chops herbs. This is a keeper!"
1216,2,"I bought this water bottle just before I took a trip to Vegas. I hand washed it, and threw it in my carry on bag. After getting through airport security, I filled the bottle with about 24 oz of water at a water fountain.<br />While waiting on my plane, I drank from the bottle without any problems. About a hour into my plane ride I got thirsty and drank from my bottle. The minute I pressed the button to drink, water squirted out of the bottle like a water hose onto the fellow passenger behind me. As I was closing the spout, my iPad, shirt, and pants also got wet with water. About 8 oz of water shot out of the bottle in seconds.  I apologized for several minutes and calmed the &#34;guy with the wet shirt&#34;, down  as best as I could after explaining it was just water and I was sorry. A hour later, the same thing happened to my mom who was also on the plane. She bought the exact bottle before we left for Vegas.<br /><br />Since, I squired myself in the face after leaving the bottle in my car (it was only 55 degrees out) and once while sitting at my desk in the office.<br /><br />I like the bottle itself, but they need to do something about the spout. Every time I open it now, I open it slowly. I look weird doing after paying $16 for a &#34;leak proof&#34; water bottle. It;'s leak proof but not squirt proof!!<br /><br />Please fix!!"
1217,5,"This is our second Moccamaster.  The first lasted about 7 years.  We are admitted &#34;coffee snobs&#34; and really enjoy the coffee this produces.  We recently traveled and the rental unit had only a standard drip into glass carafe that heated the coffee from the bottom hot plate.  In comparison, the rental unit's machine took too long to brew and burnt the coffee from the bottom.<br /><br />If I could make one change to the Moccamaster - it would be to be able to buy a replacement machine without the carafe.  The stainless steel carafe from our first is perfectly functional; now we have two.  It does come in handy when we have guests.<br /><br />We were disappointed in the price increase, however."
1218,5,"I love these cups for my 3-year old. They don't spill at all. He struggled a bit to get them to work with his little fingers, but once he practiced he drinks out of them with no problem. I recommend them."
1219,5,The pitter actually works quite well. Haven't used the slicer yet as sometimes the avocado is too soft to slice.
1220,5,"delighted to make my cakes ponques and wife, no tie to wear your oven cooking, these few minutes and come ready. thanks"
1221,5,It opens cans.  It does it well.  It does it fast.  It seems durable.  It is not ugly.  Nuff said.
1222,1,we are using it each Sunday for a church breakfast and it is very handy to use and works well.
1223,5,"I'm not very wordy this morning, but it is a great little countertop composter.  I highly recommend it.  Thank you."
1224,5,"I received the ice cream maker and immediately made the raspberry sorbet, DELICIOUS! Cant wait to try some other recipes."
1225,5,I lived in Argentina for 2 years and wished I had bought something like this.<br /> This is a wonderful memory of this great country and their cluture
1226,4,I like the mat and the color.  The only problem is that it does have a tendency to slide around on the floor.
1227,5,Using this item for years now. Holding up very well. It will probably last forever. Easy to clean and stores away with ease.
1228,4,"Everything is fine about this EXCEPT you cannot put it in the dishwasher.  If you could do that, it would easily be a 5 star."
1229,1,"Despite the other poor reviews, being a Bunn Guy, I purchased this anyway.  Worked for a couple of weeks.  Now spits water and coffee all over the place.  I've cleaned it, disassembled, reassembled, wasted a lot of time and coffee.  A huge disappointment."
1230,5,This is perfect! Exactly what I was looking for... I plan on buying a couple more!  I highly recommend to any tea enthusiast.
1231,5,This product was well worth the money I paid for it. The quality of this product exceeded my expectations for my son's 21st Birthday Bash.
1232,1,"after 2 months i used it fine, then it does not heat it makes this clicking sound then again and again w t f? !! people who make it they bad, am returning it better take it broken!!!"
1233,2,"I just received this item and needed to call to have a replacement sent. I am keeping my fingers crossed that the replacement is in perfect shape- I definitely should have checked the other review! The chalkboard area was scratched to the point that the glass was visible, and the spigot does not seem strong at all."
1234,3,Who is Helen Chen? The only thing different about these scissors is a shorter blade. The branding makes no sense.
1235,5,I LOVE my cookie cutters.  You can use them for just about everything to measure your food out right good.
1236,5,I wish the lid closed more tightly but it is a very convenient carrier for one or two bottles. The strap makes it easy to tote. It is an ideal carrier for BYOB or for reds to a picnic but I do not think it will keep a chilled bottle cold for too long since it does not close tightly.
1237,3,"It is effective at grading, but so are most other graders.  The problem is its size.  Much bigger than it needs to be and therefore takes up way to much storage space in drawer."
1238,5,"I have a Brothers label maker and purchased the silver tape (black letters.)  I have beautiful Waterford decanters and they don't always hold the same liquor so these work well.  Devil's Cut Whiskey isn't something that comes standard, making your own lables works great.  Considering the cost for custom labels, this is the best alternative especially if you have a labelmaker."
1239,5,"I got sick of paying full price for these in the store.  These work great and fit properly.  Came in one box (not individually boxed) so that was nice too, not having to deal with all of the extra boxes."
1240,5,"When I received this product in the mail, I was amazed of the size. It is very spacious and very sturdy."
1241,5,"this works exactly as expected and Ive filled my co2 tank 4 times now, works a charm, I dont hesitate adding a little more co2 now."
1242,5,"My mom had me order this for her, she is in love with it! Gotta love no sharp edges. :)"
1243,5,"Since return from Key West, we have been searching for a way to make our Cuban coffee &#34;properly&#34;. This is it. Great finish, look, and performs awesome. Only down fall is it only makes four cups (shots)."
1244,5,I realize this crockpot doesn't have all the bells and whistle of some of the more technologically advanced versions. But it is functional (lid holder is extremely handy) and consistent. Something I can't say about the self-timed versions. Amazing price!
1245,5,I you haven't ordered something from the elevate line you should. These knives nicely complement other elevate items I own.
1246,5,The friend who I bought this for has said that it was one of the most perfect gifts ever. And it really does look just like a regular red s**o cup
1247,5,These charcoal filters are in a clear plastic bag rather than a carton so there is no extra advertising and packaging waste. They seem to work as well as the name brand and the price is better.
1248,5,"Cheap, good insulation, everyone should have one, you deserve to buy. I hope I can help to you thanks end."
1249,5,"All aspects of this product met my needs.  I needed something that held a good variety of pods, was up off my counter and was easy to clean both the product and underneath.  The tray pulls out very easily to access my pods.  It is perfect to me and I would recommend it to others looking for a great Coffee Storage Drawer Holder for Keurig Pods and their Keurig  Coffee Maker."
1250,3,"The sprayer lid worked well, but the bottom part was broken. I kept it because my old lid was broken, but the bottom still worked.  So be the 2, I have one whole. The Misto is not great, bit works better than any others I've tried. My old one worked well for 4 years."
1251,4,"I love Corelle and the colors on this were beautiful; however, the bowls are WAY too big to use as dinnerware and too small to use as serveware. If I could, I'd return the set and just order the dinner and lunch plates."
1252,5,"I own one and bought this as the second one because we wanted one in our bedroom as well as our kitchen.  We used a decorative cabinet in our bedroom and created our own mini-kitchen in our master suite area and knew that we would get another one of these Electric Kettles for it.  It heats quickly and quietly, shuts off automatically.  There's a clear window to tell you how high the water level is and it is marked to tell you not to fill above a certain line.  There is a temperature control knob.  Easy to clean.  Nice grip.  Really like everything about it.  Cord is designed to be close to an outlet."
1253,3,"The picture of the cake plate looks like a deep rich fuchsia color on my computer, but in person it is actually a lighter fuchsia color with some pale pink mixed in.  Also, you can really only use about 7.5-8&#34; of the centered space if you want your cake to be flat - the petals slant upward.  It would have been nice to see this cake plate pictured with an actual cake on it.  Regardless, I will keep it for cookies or a little girl's birthday cake."
1254,5,"Love it, great that I got all six shapes, instructions were easy to understand and these are fun to make.  Co-workers were surprised when I brought out my snack of a star shaped egg.  I would recommend"
1255,4,I got this lid for my lidless nonstick skillets.  I wanted a glass lid for making naan since one needs to be able to see when it bubbles.  The lid works well though it fits a bit low on the 12&#34; skillet.  I wash it by hand so I can't comment on how it does in a dishwasher.
1256,4,"It was time for a better set of knives and after much research I settled on these. I am very happy with them and as posted by others, these knives are sharp."
1257,5,"They came a day early, super sharp, great quality knives if you have a budget and are wanting a good set"
1258,5,This bread keeper works great.  I put the homemade bread in it after it has cooled down and place in the refrigerator and it is always fresh.
1259,5,"Love it!  Use it for squash, carrots, whatever I can find,  The zucchini and yellow squash taste just like pasta, thus, less carbs.  Worth every penny!"
1260,2,"I ordered the wok and three skillets with textured bottoms, they stick. I do not own metal utensils yet surface already flaking off. This is definitely not a replacement for non stick pans. Followed the directions exactly and found them to be totally wrong. These pans do not get hotter or cook faster and other non stick pans. Oiling them before use does not prevent sticking. Over all these pans are not worth the cost of shipping much less what I paid for them."
1261,5,Nice form and function. Easy to fill and fit in our fridge perfectly. I have run 30 gallons through it already and I am still getting o reading.
1262,4,"I conducted a blind taste test with a friend. I told them that I found a different coke and wanted to see if they could tell the difference if one was better. I filled the coke halfway just at the waist of the glass. They felt that the coke in the Riedel glass tasted sweeter than the coke in a typical coffee mug. It was pretty awesome when I revealed that they were from the same coke can.<br /><br />That being said, I believe there are very small subtleties in tasting with this glass. If you're just planning to gulp down some coke along with your burger and fries, this probably won't make much of a difference in taste. So far I've experiment with two different pour levels: one at the waist of the glass, one filled to the top with 1 can of coke. If I let the coke sit a few minutes when poured to the waist, I can really get a refined fragrance from the coke. The glass really facilitates in condensing the aroma into the bulbous top half.<br /><br />I still need to do some more testing with this glass to determine the best way to drink coke from this glass. Some variances I'll be testing include<br />- Pour level<br />- Pour down the center, pour to the side of the glass (to experiment with differences in carbonation)<br />- Ice cubes (One review I read about this emphasized how different the coke tastes with ice)<br />- Temperature (room, refrigerated)<br /><br />As one reviewer mentions, the real question that needs to be asked is if it's really the glass that makes the difference in taste or if it's the way the coke is served. I'll follow up with my findings at a later point. For now, I really do enjoy how the glass can accumulate the fragrance of the coke and allow me to smell more subtle notes."
1263,5,"These wonderful salt and pepper shakers are just what I need.  I don't have a problem with the size, and they match my kitchen."
1264,1,"I have one of the Lekue larger steamers that I use with vegetables and I LOVE it (highly recommend). Hubby and I eat a lot of poached eggs so I thought I'd give these a try. Like other reviewers, I followed the directions and the egg exploded in the microwave while still cooking. I then popped out what was left to find it VERY unevenly cooked; both the white and the yolk were fully cooked in some spots and raw in others. When I split it open with a fork, it had a second, less violent explosion. Combine all those factors and it is a complete, utter FAIL for me."
1265,4,What can I say--its a spoon rest--it does its job.  Perfectly matches a set of stove top salt and pepper shakers.
1266,5,"I've been looking to get some silicone mats for a while. This is a pretty good price for 2 mats. Others go for almost this price for 1 mat alone! Why would you want silicone mats? They can replace parchment paper for macarons. They are oven safe, dishwasher safe, and great to use for baking as they truly make my pan non stick. Great price for the two mats."
1267,5,Bought this for my son who is in college and loves the game.  He absolutely loves the mug! Highly recommend.
1268,4,"for some odd reason I thought these would be bigger, so not really usable for the home as they are so small  but they do look very nice."
1269,4,"Haven't had a chance to use this yet, but it looks like it will be fine.  I will probably not use it all that often"
1270,5,"This spice and coffee grinder from Epica has a 3 5/8 in. footprint, with a low center of gravity, and is very stable on the four non-slip feet.  The 24 in. polarized electric cord winds underneath for storage.<br /><br />The stainless-steel reservoir is easily removed to empty the contents or for cleaning.  The transparent cover locks the reservoir in place.  For safety, the grinder can only be operated with the cover in place.<br /><br />The stainless steel blade does an excellent job of evenly grinding coffee beans to the desired fineness.  I have also used it with Sichuan pepper and cardamom and it does an excellent job with them, as well.  It also easily converts granulated sugar into powdered sugar and a snip of vanilla bean added to the reservoir will give the sugar a nice flavor, as well.<br /><br />It is best to use bursts vs. a long continuous grind, because it does work fast and it is always possible to continue the process to obtain finer particles.<br /><br />This grinder is more stable than some similar ones I have used and it is easier to operate.  It is also obvious which way the cap goes on because the power button aligns with a metal strip on the body of the grinder.  Having a removable reservoir is also a big convenience, compared to machines that do not have one.  The 250 watt motor is more powerful than many and is fairly quiet, too.<br /><br />A sample was provided for testing and evaluation."
1271,5,We've had this for 2 months now. It is a great size and super cute. My 2 year old loves it and hasn't managed to destroy it yet.
1272,1,Use this unit and eggs were getting out underneath. It seem like it is not that flat or even. I use theother brands and shapes that I bought and they were good. This one is a junk.
1273,5,Love these cute cocktail napkins! Living in Hawaii everyone always comments on the napkins under their paradise cocktails. Will order more as soon as I get close to running out!
1274,5,This thermometer is great.  Gets to the temperature fast.  It came perfectly in cal and I really like that you can recal it.  Bought it for the waterproof nature for brewing.  Haven't had to test how waterproof it is yet.
1275,5,"I'm a homebrewer and baker, so I use scales a lot to measure out ingredients. It's nice to be able to do small quantities (oz) for hops and yeast, as well as larger ones (lbs) for grains and flour. Plus, the low profile makes it easy to store. My older digital scale was quite bulky."
1276,5,Been looking for these for a while and was happy to find them at a good price. Received them quickly after purchase. Very happy with the product.
1277,3,"Just got my Turbo Fry Oven. Honestly, I expected something better. I am not sure if I will keep it. first of all, it is a huge oven, it takes a lot of place on your counter. Second, as people already mentioned, the noise is like the microwave noise during the time of cooking. Cleaning - ugh -  the cleaning is the big issue; It is a huge bowl hard to clean after cooking. You will have to wait until it gets cold , like for an hour,  to clean it., it is not a self-cleaning machine..... Ugh, I see more negatives than positives. I made frys that came not crispy at all. It came like dry potato. nobody was impressed with the frys. I made chicken breast, wasn't bad, I like how all greases go on the bottom and meat done healthy. I think the process of baking meat without greases is the only thing that is good about this machine. I am not sure about others secura ovens, but this one has a huge hole on the bottom that prevent you from many options of cooking. I saw on youtube how the older model works, and I think it should be better choice to buy it. Honestly, I don't like it at all."
1278,1,Nearly impossible to get ice cubes out without breaking them. When filling then up you end spilling then everywhere because of the flexible design. Great idea. Poor execution.
1279,1,"I don't know about \\""sides icing up\\"".  That's not my experience at all.<br /><br />I bought this thing for my bar.  I used to (still do) put bottles of liquor that are normally consumed chilled in the refrigerator, but Vinotemp sells this device claiming to chill liquor to -5 F.  What a great idea, I could take our most popular liquors, serve them even colder, and at the ready.  It's \\""NSF\\"" rated for commercial use.  That used to mean something.  The \\""lowest\\"" temp I've recorded is 22.5 F in the well after being plugged in over three days.  The shots are not really that icy at 22.5 F.  That sounds really cold, but it's not -5 F, and after coming out of the spout and into a shot glass it's a lot higher.<br /><br />NSF, right...  I don't know how they achieved this certification.  I can only assume the NSF rating wasn't for being able to maintain -5 degrees.  Liquor doesn't need to be refrigerated so I don't know what they're basing the NSF rating on.  It doesn't have a heavy duty feel to it.  The machine itself is very light. Seriously, this thing does not have any commercial stainless and the top is cheap plastic.  The adapters to hold liquor bottles are ok, but because of the range of liquor bottle styles it's a little tricky getting some bottles to stand inverted, and protrude 1/2 below the adapter.<br /><br />If you start with liquor frozen from the freezer that's the coldest it will ever be because this machine will eventually allow it to warm up (22.5 degrees in my case).  I have the double shot \\""two well\\"" chiller.  Each well has a separate transformer and refrigeration components so I am doubtful that I received a physically defective unit.  I suspect it's not engineered to truly do what they say it does as it's ability to chill is weak.<br /><br />Additionally, the first shot poured will be considerably warmer because the plastic spout is room temp and the first liquor to pass through it is warmed as well.  Additional shots are colder, but only marginally.  Theyshould include a drip tray because it does drip a couple drops after pouring, but the bottom line is this this does not work as advertised.<br /><br />I contacted the company a few days ago and I've received no response so far.  Hopefully they will take this unit back and send me one that does chill to -5 F."
1280,5,"I like the size, thickness, and look of these cards -- much better than the 3&#34; x 5&#34; cards.  They were very reasonably priced, as well."
1281,5,"Sometimes you never get around to buying yourself new glasses after a few have broken. Gave as gift and she said they were perfect, hardy and very stylish."
1282,5,"Yes, As always KitchenAid stuff is amazing...this included! You won't regret this one (unless you choose to not use it)."
1283,4,These straws are slightly shorter than the alternative rainbow colored replacement acrylic straw set. I found they work better in the standard 12 -16oz glasses.
1284,4,"I don't use functionally, just as a decoration, but it fits perfectly into my Italian restaurant setting in my kitchen"
1285,1,Both of these leaked constantly. I had to return them.  I have other Contigo travel mugs that work great. I'm not sure what the problem was with these but definitely not leak proof.
1286,5,Had one before and loved it. Lost in moving but now I have another one....YAY!!! Would highlt recommend to others. Makes the job much easier.
1287,5,"Box is of substantial size, sturdy and looks good.  I purchased this not certain what the quality would be since the price was so right.  It was better than expected and happy I purchased it."
1288,5,"THE RICE COOKER IS PERFECT FOR ME. I REALLY ENJOYED IT . NOW I CAN HAVE A BOWL OF FRESH COOKED<br />RICE AT DINNER, AND DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT LEFTOVER. THE COOKER COOKS RICE FAST, AND EASY<br />TO CLEAN."
1289,5,"I bought one of this at Overstock.com about eight years ago. The pan has served me well until now, since the teflon coating seems to have worn out. I will buy more of these if they ever become available again,"
1290,5,"We sometimes have lots of labels to remove in the used books store at our library. Nothing can do the job that these scrapers can, and they save your nails and fingers from pain. The plastic ones are not as efficient as the one with the thin metal blade, but they work for less sticky labels."
1291,5,BerryBreeze is BerryGood!!!!!  After nearly three weeks my grapes are little soft but perfectly tasty...........no mold!!!!  Great product........thanks!!!!!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!
1292,5,"Used it the second day and love it. Everything I hoped for. Takes a little bit of strength for denser foods like carrots, but it does work wonderfully. I had borrowed one from a co-worker and could hardly wait to get my own.  I would buy this again and again. It would make the perfect gift as well."
1293,5,Beautiful PERFECT construction.  Wife loves it.  It is just like the picture.<br />There is NO shoddy workmanship here.  Thank you!
1294,5,Wife with arthritis was getting very frustrated with lids and caps at work or when out and about. This device has given her some of her freedom back by not having to ask someone for help or by allowing her to have the products she had to avoid before. Thanks for returning some of her abilities.
1295,5,So simple yet so great. Perfect for anyone who bakes their own bread or buys unsliced fresh loaves of bread. A perfect slice every time! Best thing since sliced bread... :-P
1296,5,"Super cute mug! Reminds me of the beach in the winter cold. Perfect size if you want a bigger cup of tea, hot chocolate, or whatever. It's also nice and sturdy. I hope mine lasts forever but if I see another one on here I'm definitely going to buy it, just in case!"
1297,5,We are updating our kitchen so I wanted to buy trivets that would match the countertop. The quality is much better than I expected. They are very well made and almost too beautiful to use. The bottom has sturdy plastic feet to keep them stable. I'm going to order a second set to gift to my friend. Great value!
1298,5,A bit pricey but makes a great pot of coffee.  Only weird attribute is the clearance between the hot water output nozzles and the filter basket is very tight - I've adapted to this by trimming 1/4&#34; off the #4 filters so it doesn't get hung up when sliding the pot into position.
1299,1,"the second time i went to use it.  no go.  pugged and un-plugged it. changed electricl outlets.  still, dead in the water."
1300,5,So excited to receive my Charming Trays!!! Can't wait to use them at my next Jewelry Bar coming up soon!!! -Leigh Ann
1301,5,"We have a taco truck, and I have been looking for something like this for a long time.  It has a lid, and is insulated.  Keeps the salsa cold between servings.  It pours and serves perfectly.  The customers love it.  I just ordered two.  Have only had them a week.  Will let you know how they hold up.<br /><br />Well we have been using these little pots every day for 4 months and they have held up amazingly well, as they do get some harsh treatment.  I am really amazed, and they clean  up so easily.  I would highly recommend them."
1302,5,This is the most awesome invention ever. I actually got this for my Aunt and Uncle and after 3 yeas it is still working as good as ever. Best for people with arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome.
1303,5,"I was so tired of the drips and leaks from my old-fashioned honey dispenser.  This little gem is easy to fill and dispenses beautifully.  When drips build up in the base, simply add hot water and brew some tea."
1304,4,I get sick of filling this thing and it seems like I have to crank it a lot to get enough salt out.
1305,5,"Easy to install. Nice place to keep knives, looks good, reasonable price and is organizes well too.  Would recommend to a friend."
1306,5,Does exactly what it's supposed to do. Makes 4&#34; pizzelles. I had no problems with the machine or with sticking or anything. It's perfect!
1307,4,"We decided a knife block took up valuable counter space, so stored our knives in a drawer. To avoid slashing ourselves when retrieving them we thought we would try this. Perfect. It's nicely made and holds quite a few knives, both large and small. Can't give it five stars only because it's a little silly to love a knife tray,"
1308,2,"It looked great out of the box and felt properly heavy for the purpose that it intended to fill.  The stainless steel surface appeared flawless, both inside and out.  Iv'e wanted a pan for some time that was thick enough to transfer heat well for use on electric stove top (after roasting) to make gravy from meat gravy.  This one won't due because after only one use a chip appeared in the bottom surface about a quarter inch across.  The only tool used in the process was a bamboo scraper for dislodging solids during deglazing, with white wine.  If this continues, the pan will become unusable after only few times.  I returned it for replacement in kind.  If the next one does the same I'll return it and swear off of Cuisinart cooking implements in the future.<br /><br />Lee_B"
1309,5,"Purchased this pressure cooker basted on reviews and it is great, I was not disappointed by this purchase. Cooked a roast beef meal and it was perfectly cooked and delicious. It has flexible options unlike a conventional pressure cooker and very easy to use. This appears to be a high quality product which should perform well in the long run."
1310,1,"This blender is not well made.  The buttons stick and when we used it once, the hi/low button never functioned at all.  The top plastic cup on the lid does not fit securely, so it is hard to open the lid at all.  I am returning it right away.  Sadly..."
1311,5,"I wanted a reusable container for my hubby to take his potato chips for lunch that would also protect them from getting crushed. We tried the snack bags, but after awhile even with washing in the dishwasher or washing machine, they felt greasy and smelled bad.  Most reusable containers are too big. (I wish lunchbots made the small size without the divider as it would be perfect, but I digress) This one works well.  I wasn't sure about the dimensions- one reviewer said it would work; another said it was too small.  But for us, it's the right size.  Fits easily in his bag, cleans up nicely, doesn't retain odors. Just as a disclaimer, I buy organic chips fried in olive oil, so they are not the monstrous-size mass market chips, so if you have a lot of extra large chips they may not fit."
1312,5,If you have the Lodge Carbon Skillet you need this pot handle. It's much thicker than I anticipated and works very well for those hot pans on the stovetop or when the pan is in the oven. The holder is easy to slip on the handle if your pan is in the oven.
1313,4,Follow the instructions. And know that the butter will eventually spoil - after about 30 days or so. I actually refrigerate and leave out before times when I want to serve it.
1314,5,"Received iMicrowave today ( On time )  And item was damaged out of the box, Seems as &#34;Cosmetic&#34; only but won't be used in the new house for some time... Amazon was quick to apply a partial refund instead of sending the unit back and fourth and all the drama with that... I did have to try the &#34;Popcorn&#34; setting on the counter and it cooked the whole bag in 2:30 with around 20-25 unpoped in the bag, Way better than what we have been using for the last 8 + years... So far so good... I will add/edit after we get the house wired and have a chance to really use it...Thanks Amazon for a quick response to our issue...M... (EVIL ZJ)"
1315,5,This is a new color for me. Hard to say what the color really is; the product is LeCreuset and I enjoy all their products I have ever purchased.
1316,5,"Goofy little wine glass, but was a big hit with my friend as a Christmas gift.  This guy will tell everyone your mood before you have to say a thing."
1317,2,But you have to treat it very gently. I'm ordering a new one since the old one cracked in half after a year or so of use.
1318,5,"Love this little mill! Doesn't leave a mess when placed on a surface, and the grind is adjustable. It's one of the many quality items recommended at Amazing Ribs.com."
1319,5,I've been looking for a smaller roaster/casserole for a couple months - this is just the right size for a two per on household.  Not a ton of leftovers and food is cooked evenly.  And you can't beat the price!
1320,5,"No mess, grind from the top salt & pepper grinders.  Just the right size and easy to use.  Very happy with the purchase."
1321,4,I wanted to give it a lower rating but after consideration I only took one star. Reason being these things are hard to work and you still have prepping to do before you cut bc the grate is so small. Not the sellers fault its the manufacturer.  I bought it for onions potatoes for potato soup & french fries.  For little pieces of potatoes slice potatoes first & save yourself headake. The product came on time & does work. Irs just a bit of a workout to use.
1322,5,This incredibly affordable skillet was top rated by Cooks Illustrated and their rating was recently confirmed with new testing. We use it all the time. Excellent food release and easy to handle.
1323,2,"I purposely ordered this one (based on photo & description) for my elderly mother. The one that arrived, was a different model that was not reviewed favorably on Amazon by other customers due to difficulties with the lid. Item was also received 'postage due' of several dollars for some unknown reason. Item returned."
1324,5,"This set it amazing. Very well detailed. My favorite thing is that the colored shot glasses arent painted green, red and blue. The glass is actually that color, that way you dont have to deal with chipping paint after a few uses. The glass is thick and strong. I very much enjoy using these."
1325,1,"I would love these containers if it wasn't for the fact that they came defective. The edges along the lip of the black container, where the lid attaches, have extra plastic flashing causing the lid not to attach well... If there's one thing I hate, it's to receive out of box defects!!!"
1326,5,"The instant pot makes great food and clean up is easy. I would recommend it for college students and small apartments if you have a fridge and a big enough sink for the 6 quart pot.<br /><br />I bought an Instant Pot because I'm remodeling the kitchen after flooding, and it was cheaper than eating out for a month. So far I've made rice, beans, chicken stew, chicken broth, baked apples, and steamed carrots. Everything came out very well except the carrots, which were my fault. In most cases it came out better than other cooking methods I have tried. Clean up was a breeze.<br /><br />I'm sure that all the taste benefits (perfect rice, tender and juicy meat, delicious beans) are just as achievable with a stovetop pressure cooker, but it's nice that the instant pot provides automatic settings for a lot of things, and they seem to work well. Also you don't need a stove to use it.<br /><br />One bad thing I have to say so far is it's too easy to make tasty rice. I have eaten more white rice this week than in the rest of the year combined.<br /><br />The other, and this is the only actual bad thing, is the beeping is pretty loud and there's no way (that I can tell) to turn it down or off. This would be a problem if you have a roommate, especially if you are on different schedules. (I remember college!) I guess that's the same as a microwave but the instant pot beeps when it starts cooking so you can't just watch it and hit cancel before it beeps. It also makes cute noises when you put the lid on and when you seal it, which is nice because you don't forget to seal the lid, but again, it'd be nice if the volume were adjustable. (I decided I can't really dock it a star for beeping because it really doesn't affect me, but it's something to be aware of)<br /><br />Rice: I have never used a fancy rice cooker like a Zojirushi, so I can only compare stove top and cheap rice cookers, but I love the rice this thing makes. I would say that if I can make good rice in this cooker then it's really foolproof because however hard I try I could never make good rice before.  Basmati rice cooked on the standard rice setting with no soaking was ready in 20 minutes. It came out better than stovetop or my $10 rice cooker. Rice was fluffy. Grains were separate, long and straight. The texture was smooth, tender and slightly chewy in a pleasant way (even though I usually like my grains cooked to death). No burning, only slight crusting at the bottom (the good kind). Rice did not stick to the bottom, clean up was easy. With soaking and the long natural release (because I got distracted writing this review) my second try came out very soft but still fluffy with nice long individual grains, so it seems like it does a good job at various textures and is pretty forgiving. Also you can make as little as one cup of rice at a time. Then you can finish that, look around shiftily, and make another cup. No one can stop me. I'm an adult.<br /><br />Beans: Soaked overnight, then cooked on the bean setting. We browned salt pork and onions using the saute setting, then added the beans and broth. Cooked using the standard bean setting. Beans were delicious, far better than any other cooking method I have tried. We ate some, then decided to cook the rest to almost a mash (like refried beans) on slow cook for two hours. Because we could I guess. That was delicious too. No burning on the bottom of the pot, clean up was easy.<br /><br />Chicken stew: I browned chicken drumsticks and onions, added liquids and vegetables, then cooked for 25 minutes on the manual pressure cook setting. The meat was very flavorful, and falling off the bone, with a really good texture. I removed the bones and set aside for stock. The stew was very good. The leftovers gelled in the fridge because so much collagen was extracted from the chicken. No clean up because I went straight into making chicken broth in the same pot.<br /><br />Chicken broth: After putting the stew leftovers in the fridge I added the chicken bones and skins from the stew, some aromatics, and water back to the pot and pressure cooked for 90 minutes on manual, getting a nice flavorful chicken broth. The broth did not gel in the fridge because much of the collagen already went into the stew. I think it would have gelled if I had used bones from a roast chicken.<br /><br />Baked apples: I put a chopped up apple with some sugar and spices in a coffee filter on top of the steamer tray and steamed for 1 minute with water in the bottom of the pot. The total cook time was around 9 minutes. The apple was mostly tender but crispy enough to retain its shape. There wasn't much clean up - I just had to rinse out the pot.<br /><br />Steamed carrots: This was the first thing I tried to cook and it didn't go well, but I think it was my fault. I put the carrots directly on the steamer tray and some of them fell into the water. You really need a basket on top of the tray. I also steamed for 4 minutes. That was way too long and the carrots were overdone. On the bright side the water in the bottom of the pot became an orange carrot flavored broth which I drank.<br /><br />So far I have not had to do any extensive clean up to the lid. Food hasn't splattered on it during cooking or anything. Clean up would be harder if it did given all the crevices but so far there has just been water condensation on the lid so I give it a rinse in very hot water and that's it.d the chicken bones and skins from the stew, some aromatics, and water back to the pot and pressure cooked for 90 minutes on manual, getting a nice flavorful chicken broth.

1327,3,"These are okay. They don't hold the temperature as much as we'd like but, they do the job for porting hot liquids. The cover is a little fussy to deal with but, overall we are pleased with the general function and look of these mugs."
1328,5,In my refrigerator I am luck to get 1 week from lettuce but with this I have been over 3 and the lettuce is still as crisp as new.
1329,1,"I just would not recommend this at all. We tried hanging it on the wall, as we live in a very small apartment. It looks cool and it was nice that spices and labels came with it. HOWEVER, the magnet was weak so if one of them feel - the entire display went tumbling. Just one little arm bump and they are all on the floor. So then we tried using the stand to rest it on the counter - before we could even fill the containers one magnet had already fallen from the container. I would say it would be EXCELLENT if they used a better magnet product, otherwise - for me, it was simply not functional."
1330,4,Only Wish the temp went a little higher. But I could not ask for more for the price I paid.
1331,5,Works well for my 7 year olds lunch box and keeps food warm until lunch time. She uses every day
1332,5,"Snap together well, easy to wash (non-stick), I use it for all of my baking and pancake/crepe/waffle making. The magnets are a star feature.  Minimizes drawer space needed."
1333,5,"I have to say I have not actually had time to use it much yet, but it is beautiful! The scale appears to be of excellent quality, works flawlessly and has so many useful functions! I believe this is the best scale I could have purchased and for such a great price! I also had prompt delivery. If you are thinking of purchasing a scale, just buy it and while you are at it, get a few more for gifts! FYI, I am in no way affiliated with this company; this is a great product and would make a great gift, but by all means - at least get one for yourself."
1334,3,"The good news - the can opener works.  As with the majority of new can openers, it does a relatively quiet, clean job of getting the lid off a standard sized can.  Somewhere in the Amazon reviews I read that it &#34;even opens Costco sized cans&#34;  I most definitely have to respectfully disagree.  Aging has taken its toll on my ability to use a manual can opener on the larger Costco cans (6 lbs 10 oz size).  Unfortunately, the Proctor Silex blade sits too high above the lid of the can.  As grade school children used to chant:  &#34;Too bad, so sad, your dad.&#34;  Never did know exactly what that meant but it just seemed appropriate for this review."
1335,5,"I bought these to compliment my dishes and what I like about them is that they can be used for cereal, soup, or small salads, plus they are microwave and dishwasher save ... a must at our house!  I also like the variety of designs and especially that the designs are on both sides of the bowl which I found hard to find when I was looking for bowls."
1336,4,"My only issue with this kettle is the short cord it has, however I understand the safety reasoning behind it."
1337,5,This is a great machine. I used it for both wet and dry settings and it worked quite well. I made my own bgs and the sealer was excellent.
1338,2,"I bought two of this particular mold.  I have the same trouble with both in that the cups do not come out cleanly.<br /><br />I am a professional chocolate maker; I know how to temper and I own dozens of professional polycarb molds -- this is not an issue of user error.  This is the only mold I have this trouble with, and the same problem occurs with both of them.<br /><br />I polish the molds in between uses but the tiny texture pattern on the bottom and within makes it quite difficult to get ALL of the cocoa butter out. It takes a VERY long time to polish this mold completely and polishing only helps a little -- they still stick.<br /><br />I only use it once per year when I make a special truffle, but I dread it every time because I need to produce hundreds and I am lucky to get 5-10 usable cups with each attempt.  Half of them break attempting to unmold because they stick to the bottom so badly.  I even tried using confectioner's coating which does not need tempered to try in them, which produced the same bad results.<br /><br />Not sure if I got two 'defective' molds or if it is this particular model, but I am definitely not happy with this purchase and wish I could still return them."
1339,3,I purchased this primarily to mix up my shakeology. If you need to fill the whole cup it doesn't work properly. I had to mix it with a spoon after I was shaking it for 10 minutes.
1340,5,My fashionista daughter loves her new water bottle. No problems with the cap or the seal. Easy to clean. Would definitely buy this style again.
1341,2,"I was so disappointed in this canister that I placed it right back in the box and drove to the UPS store within an hour of receiving it so that I could send it back ASAP.  My main complaint was that on the lid and on one side the stainless steel was oddly discolored.  I don't know if these were actual stains, or just some kind of leftover fabrication fluid that might have washed off with some effort on my part.  It was very noticeable and should have never made it past any kind of quality control check.  For this price, I expected better.<br /><br />The canister is smaller than I expected, but would hold a 12 oz bag of beans, and maybe a whole pound of beans.  The photo looks like it is round but it is oval in shape and the interior is divided - it has a narrow slot on the side of the coffee holding area to put the #4 size cone-shaped filters in.  If you are using the fluted filters this is not for you, and even if you use the cone filters you will not be able to put a whole box worth in here.  If I had kept it I think I would have been filling up the filter compartment weekly.  The inside is black plastic, with a thin sheet of stainless steel glued on the outside to give it the stainless look.  I think this is a sturdy canister and based on the reviews some people love it.  But I found the top difficult to open, the size a bit small, and the blotchy look off-putting."
1342,2,"Although it is advertised as a functional tea kettle, this kettle is more for looking at than making tea. The lid is very very difficult to put on, and if you manage to get it on, it is nearly impossible to get it back off. That, combined with the fact that it doesn't whistle when it reached boils makes using it more trouble than it is worth. For the money, buy a real tea kettle, not this wannabe."
1343,5,"I like it a lot! I haven't used it too often, but when I do I am not disappointed to get the shape from the rice I want to eat."
1344,2,"I haven't had any of the problems with the handle breaking or the lid coming off, but once you put the cupcakes in - that's it - they are IN!  Never to come out unless you destroy the cupcakes with a fork to get them out.<br /><br />Seriously flawed.  So disappointed."
1345,2,"When this works it is great, but don't expect more than 12-16 months use out of this.  I can't tell you how many of these Aeroccino's I've been through over the years.  The early ones just failed, then the next generation ones had the non-stick surface start to peel after 8-12 months.  In this generation milk starts to burn on the bottom after 12-16 months.  I've learned over the years to immediately pour cold water into the Aeroccino to flush it and cool it after use.  Never use abrasive cleaning products, this helps to preserve the non-stick surface.  After 16 months of use (I'm single so at most I use it once a day) it burns milk on every instance.  You know the milk is burned because the start button light flashes red.  Under normal use the light is solid red at startup and then turns off after finishing its frothing cycle. The next hint is when you pour your milk out and look at the brown crust on the bottom.  It seems a terrible waste to discard the Aeroccino after a year or so.  It is solidly built with a shell of chromed steel.  I'm going to try something else.  I have 3 Nespresso coffee makers that work well. One is 12 years old.  I can't understand why they can't develop a solid milk frother.  I can't tell you a better frother to use, but I'm going to try something else.  I've been burned too often."
1346,5,I had one of these for years and I loved it so much I was afraid I wouldn't find another one. Went on Amazon and there it was. I am delighted to have a new Apple Tea Pot! Thank you Amazon.
1347,5,"This is just the neatest thing, as I do a lot of pealing.  Even bought it for gifts.<br />Too many words required."
1348,1,Lids crack very easily and are hard to take off. Already threw 3 lids away. Save your Chinese take out containers. At least you DON'T have to BUY them. Skip these.
1349,1,"This is the most expensive piece of junk I've ever purchased.  First, their cup size is just over 4 ozs.  Next, not sure why, but several times I've had the overflow tray full of water/coffee several times.  I've had the unit less than 2 mos. and already the electronics are failing, the small cup button continually fails to start and on occasion the large cup button has failed.  The price on the unit has come down since I purchased mine, however, it is still not worth what they're asking.  My wife and I drink 1 to 2 pots a day (2 due to the size) and really wish we had purchased a standard brewer and put it on a timer.  Don't waste your money, and Krups . . . stop making coffee machines . . . especially one that doesn't work or deliver on any promise."
1350,5,Love these cutting board.  No more concerns about boards that can't be cleaned properly. Easy to store. Every cook needs these.
1351,4,"This works exactly as advertised , the only issue with it is it is a little bit small , I wish it wasn't , the height of it is a about 1 inch smaller than a iphone 5 , now you can imagine how big is it<br />the quality is good and color changing works perfectly<br /><br />Recommended but keep in mind the size :)"
1352,1,Not what I expected to get an oven thermometer with a plastic temperature probe cord. Now I must purchase a separate probe with a metal cord
1353,4,The pattern was very bright.  The thickness of the napkins were a lot better than I expected.  Napkins and matching plates were a big hit.
1354,5,Very durable non-stick pans. I hand was these after use. I don't put these in the dishwasher. Best pans I bought to date.
1355,5,Love these .  Great for pouring to measure when cooking or baking.  Would highly recommend these.  I am a fan of most good grip products.  I own quite a few.
1356,5,making pasta is so easy with the KitchenAid attachments!! Nothing like biting the bullet and using the pro equipment. Love em!
1357,1,Bad choice. The only thing this cookware set it good for is boiling water! Cooking...You must be kidding. It stains as soon as it hits fire and does not clean up. I am throwing it away!
1358,2,"Yes, you can get a full set of flatware for $65, but it really looks and feel like the cheapest available out there.<br /><br />One step above plastic."
1359,5,I've had these ice cubes for a while now and have had no problems with them!  I bought them to replace some older ones that were starting to bust at the seams - they are bigger than the regular square ones so keeps my drinks colder longer!
1360,4,"I scored this juicer even cheaper from a local store. It was on clearance for $20! I have a Nutribullet and that's what I generally use, but this juicer is pretty great for a sub-$50 machine.<br /><br />As others have said, YES, you need to pre-cut most of your fruits and veggies, and yes, it does make a good bit of pulp. Pulp bothers me the most coming from using a Nutribullet where there is literally no leftover waste. That being said, if you are also a drink blender you could use the pulp in smoothie or even feed it through the juicer once more to see if anymore juice can be extracted. The thing I noticed the most issue with was leafy greens, like kale and spinach. There were a few pieces that didn't even look touched in my pulp!<br /><br />It's not a perfect juicer, but it DOES juice pretty easily and is inexpensive. I would definitely suggest buying this if you're interested in juicing or need a cheap juicer to take with you somewhere."
1361,5,"This bottle is beautifully designed and executed with great craft. The lid is secure, the glass is durable and pretty thick, the design is beautiful to look at. This 12 oz (their smallest size of this line) fits well in my medium sized bag. It stands straight up inside the sides of the bag and it really does not take up much space at all. I love how much attention to detail went into the functionality of the design, especially how the silicon sleeve covers the bottom entirely, so that the bottle has grip when you set it down, and also reduces loud noises when setting down the glass bottle on hard surfaces. Really lovely bottle. Really recommend it if you want to steer away from plastic."
1362,2,This doesn't do the job of keeping your coffee hot or even warm for that matter. Very unhappy with this product for that reason alone!
1363,5,"The Fagor pressure cooker is great. I cook veggies and meats (chicken, meat loaf, beef roast) in the cooker in much less time than traditional methods. so little liquid is used that you don't lose all your nutrients as in other methods.  It's much safer and easier to use than the old cookers years ago. I liked it so much that I gave one to my daughter who is now cooking more from scratch. It's perfect for a busy young mom."
1364,5,"I have gone through purchasing three different kinds of these grinders until I finally stumbled across this one.  It is absolutely FABULOUS, is made extremely and the only one I found that actually had a lid over the compartment where you put beans or spices so they don't fly out while grinding them.......great idea that I haven't seen on any of the other ones."
1365,5,This is a cool design. I can use it for Christmas and also great when we go camping (using my camping oven). It's got the outdoor style too! Fun to decorate for a childs party. Just put some dwarfs and snow white then you're set!
1366,5,The secret in tenderizing meet with our adding lots of added salt.  I cook quite a bit of wild game and this takes some of tougher cuts to a new level.  I also use it before I sous vide many of my meat dishes.
1367,2,"I'm a retail GM and we use kitchen timers to remind us to check the bathrooms.  I have now ordered 4 of these in the last year and will order no more.  I thought my staff was destroying them, but it turns out they are just cheap junk.  None have lasted more than two weeks.  Spend a little more for a heavier, more useful timer."
1368,4,"I'm just getting into the vegetable steaming game and got this for my kitchen. Not complicated, does its job just fine.<br /><br />As some other reviews have mentioned, it's not super-sturdy (thin metal), which can make it a bit of a challenge to wash by hand as I sometimes fear too much heavy scrubbing will break it. Guess I'll just have to be careful."
1369,5,"Top rack dishwasher and microwave safe.  Beautiful, clean style and a nice, big size.  The fact that it has Snowy on it only makes it that much better."
1370,5,"Very easy to use and clean. Gets the maximum juice from all citrus. Tried grapefruit, lemon, orange and the cuties."
1371,5,"This is a very nice toaster oven.  Very easy to figure out and use.  It cooks food well, has visual and audio cues that are very useful.  It is also the perfect size for my counter."
1372,5,love these knives and would have no other as well as my son who also is a cook.  I have just about all the different sizes.
1373,4,this thing is sweet but might be easy to break?  i don't know what i did wrong but i put a split down the middle of the grater and now it's sharp and dangerous... i would probably buy another one BUT I LIKE TO LIVE ON THE EDGE
1374,3,UPDATE: The on button stopped working a while ago in terms of shutting the pot off. Now it doesn't even switch on. I'm going to try a different brand next.<br /><br />Two problems I thought might be addressed by now (second Bodum kettle I've owned)...it doesn't have an on/off switch (stays on until automatic shutoff kicks in) and it has to cool down before being able to boil a second pot of water.
1375,5,"I bought this at the same time I bought the Hoodia. I started counting callories and the ounces of meat I should have, lost 60 lbs., and am very happy!"
1376,5,"This Machine V600 is working great with no problems... I think most people don't read the manual first.. you filled the reservoir full of water. it heats up close to 3 minutes. ;put coffee cup in place. check settings for temp, than put the vue cup in , don't slam it , close it easy than select coffee , regular or strong, size cup ,I use 14 oz . than push the flashing Icon  Brew.  1 minute your coffee is done.. the coffee wont brew the same vue cup till you open and close the lid again... I think it resets itself to brew another cup.  I bought the adapter for it to use your own coffee, it worked great after 50 uses. I use k cups with the adapter removing the lid of the adapter so the K cup top is exposed . My Vue machine is still working after 90 days... I buy my coffee vue cups from Keurig.com.  register my coffee V600. buy 2 get 2 free. and I deal with starbucks and green mountain , it's more tasteful than other vue coffee's cups.it gets expensive but amazon will do deals on 54 cups for 27.99 on green mountain... have a great cup of coffee and enjoy.."
1377,5,"Can't beat the price, just what I expected for my mo bento box.  Works great to separate the food and microwave specific items."
1378,5,"Used these first at my sister's in Charlotte and LOVED these with indentation for thumb.  Super easy to grasp shatterproof glass. My niece gave me a set for Christmas.  I bought 4 sets for friends.  Excellent presents.<br /><br />B. Self<br />Jacksonville, FL"
1379,1,"Looked worn, not new, like it was supposed to be.  Would've returned, but ran out of time because of the holidays."
1380,4,"I just do not like the two swivel hooks. I purchased two additional non-swivel hooks, which meets all my needs for hanging five cast iron skillets, splatter screens and stainless spatulas. Of course I reinforced the rack with three large mounting hooks instead of just the two smaller hooks that come with the rack. Attached the mounting hooks into the ceiling joist. Cast iron skillets are very heavy. I see the price went up on both the rack and additional hooks after I purchased mine."
1381,5,"Arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  Works perfectly.  With this, I can use normal grind coffee in my percolator.  I'll also be saving money by not needing wasteful, throw-away paper filters anymore.  Trees like this."
1382,4,"Easy to whip up a quick meal, easy to clean up. It should be made clear that spraying before using will make a decided difference in handling and cleanup"
1383,5,"I've been through some higher-end knives and enjoy them for their feel.  This one is light but works beautifully, takes an edge very well and holds it.  Been using it a couple years and will replace it with another when the time comes, though that's not soon.  I steel my knives every few uses and sharped with Spyderco Tri-Angle Sharpmaker about once a month."
1384,5,Very easy to make cute little chocolate coffee bean decorations with this.  Easy clean-up and simple to use ... yeah !
1385,3,Got this for my mom and it is a little dispointed<br />some of the color print are off... as is not at the right place
1386,3,If you tryna make a nice icey pina coloda FORGET IT.<br /><br />But for fruit smoothies and milk shakes its perfect!
1387,5,"I love my lunchbag!  It carries a lot of items, folds flat when not in use, is lightweight and washes very well in the washing machine."
1388,4,"I was looking for coasters that would accommodate both drinking glasses and coffee mugs (with broad ctrcumference. Plus, they needed to absorb condensation. I did not want to overspend for this product. Second to the aforementioned, it would be nice if they included SW design, The Native American Rubber Coasters met all of the criteria . I use them daily, and would recommend them to my friends."
1389,5,"The subtle color, artful and user-friendly shape, and overall dimensions and weight don't need any refining.<br />This shape & size works better for us than the more short and squat &#34;Double Old Fashioned Glasses,&#34; which aren't as easy to hold, aren't quite as elegant, and take up more dishwasher space.<br />I wanted to order some more and was disappointed to see they aren't available any more."
1390,1,"Never even opened the package - the minute I picked it up you could hear the glass.  I imagine the entire lot of them were in small pieces.  I could blame the shipper, but some blame must go to the company that packaged the bowls!  No problem returning it though."
1391,5,"&#60;Insert Scary Outcome Here&#62;<br /><br />I was thrilled to finally find these adorable little silver balls that I remember from baking with my Grandmother when I was a young child. Now I can be the one to say 'Don't eat those!' and then tell scary stories about what might happen when they invariably get eaten. (In small quantities, these are harmless, but don't let any kids know that)<br /><br />The 2 oz. jar is generous, and will let me scare several kindergarten classes. Perfect for adding some punch to any decorating project.<br /><br />Can't wait to bake some more cookies and try them out."
1392,5,I bought a mug for my 9 year old who has a passion for anything Elephant and so I bought this and put in a Christmas box full of Elephant items.  He absolutely loved it!  The shape is different from other mugs and  being dishwasher safe was certainly a plus.
1393,5,I'm really pleased with this coffee maker.  It says &#34;5 cup&#34; but I only get 3 of my cups.  I'm still happy.  Makes good coffee and have had no problem with the coffee cone being in the pot.  Like the water well also.  Great product!
1394,5,"It is big enough, but shoving corks in it, it not the easiest thing to do, but it is a unique piece and I am glad I bought it."
1395,4,"Please make sure you FILL the bottle and SQUEEZE all the water and debris out before use! It says it on the label, but I had a friend who didnt read it.<br /><br />The color is spot on. I love that it filters the water as I drink it. The only thing I don't like, is that it can be a bit hard to drink the water. For lack of a better word, you really have to &#34;suck&#34; for it."
1396,5,Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend.  He had been wanting one for quite some time so it was the perfect Christmas present. Heats up quickly and holds heat well.  The rounded sides make it perfect for sauces as one can use a whisk and actually stir the entire sauce rather than missing what's down in the corner unless you use a spoon.  Sauces are easier for us to do using a whisk and the round sides make this the perfect pan for us.
1397,1,"So, we have a kitchen full of Cuisinart items. We really like them.... Except for this coffee pot.<br /><br />We had one that failed. It would randomly decide to turn off and stop brewing or the heater would stop working.<br /><br />We contacted Cuisinart and they sent us a replacement. PERFECT!!!<br /><br />The replacement lasted abound 9 months and started doing the same thing. We contacted Cuisinart and were told the warranty was only good for one replacement. I appealed to management and was told to go pound sand.<br /><br />We are done with Cuisinart."
1398,5,"I bought this one and the one hour timer. Only off by less than 30 seconds. Very sturdy, like a giant egg timer! Perfect for kids and if you want to time yourself practicing music."
1399,5,Love this product but very unhappy about it.  The screw broke off of the Wine opener and now it's garbage.
1400,5,This is exactly the size that I need for my Oster Toaster Oven as it fits perfectly.  I recomend this item highly
1401,4,Does what it says it will do. Heats up very quickly. My disappointment is that I thought it was cordless but it's not.
1402,4,it works great for the quick drip dry on dishes. and for those dishes on standby for the dishwasher.then toss it in the washer.
1403,5,"This banana hanger was better than I expected.  It holds the bananas well, goes well with my cabinets and countertops, and it is neither too big or too small."
1404,5,This item was better than I was expecting.  It is very high-quality and doesn't show any knife marks.  Will order another one soon.
1405,1,If I could give it -5 stars - I would have! This is the crappiest quality ever! Made in china! Huge sticker on the back! And arrived all neatly packaged... But the box must have cost more than the actual product! Shame on you DVF! Vomit on you and your terrible quality product!
1406,5,"With the extender ring, I was able to roast a little larger turkey giving me more meat that I usually freeze for future use."
1407,5,Gave it as a Christmas present they were very happy with it it cooks the hotdog The centers hot the rollsI done perfectly very pleased
1408,5,These tongs feel high quality and I have used them dozens of times already over high heat and they are still holding shape. I'm very impressed with these ultra-cheap tongs and several people have commented on the nice look and feel of them.
1409,5,I purchased these for the cook of the house and he loves them. We have had them about 2 months and have oiled them once they look great and no wear at all! I would highly recommend these cutting boards as excellent !
1410,4,"Good price, and it really helps make a great roux or gravy...  no lumps, this is my second one as I gave the other to a friend, I recommend this one.."
1411,5,"Ordered 10 of these for a Disney's \\""Frozen\\"" theme birthday party for my daughter.  They are better than I expected.  The price was great and they really create a beautiful effect hanging from the ceiling.  Thinking of ordering a few more!"
1412,4,"I really like this one. Food dries evenly and quickly. I agree with the other posters about the switch/timer issue. Old school here and I'm not fond of leaving things running out of my presence, and truly the mfg could easily add a simple timer or switch other than the user having to yank the plug or buying an additional timer, which seems kind of ridiculous in this day and age. Crock pots have timers and beeping alarms and flashing lights, this should too. However it works so well it's not a deal breaker and it hasn't given me heartburn to just unplug it. It's just archaic which makes it annoying, and has no affect on otherwise perfectly fine function."
1413,5,"The colors Fred... the colors. I'm color blind kid. Oh you bowls, you are different colored and bowl shaped. Just what I wanted."
1414,5,"Let me be honest, I didn't think this would work, but I figured that worst case I could say I tried.<br />It totally works.  It looks like I just cut it open.  I'm going to eat an Avocado from last Thursday for lunch today. (This is a Monday)<br /><br />After reading the one star reviews, I thought I would state that I strapped it in super tight and pushed it down to seal it in. (Air + Avocados = brown) I put it in the saver almost immediately after I sliced it open. I also recommend not peaking at it. I peaked last night (not thinking it would work and realized that it was perfect) and today for lunch when I opened It I noticed It did get a small itty bit brown when I opened my lunch today. I also refrigerated it. Otherwise I just ate a perfect avocado."
1415,5,Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my son & his new bride to add to their already growing Fiesta collection. The red color is absolutely beautiful & vibrant! They wanted Fiestaware because it is lead & cadmium  free.
1416,5,"I've owned several electric wine openers over the years but they don't seem to last. I bought this one as it was not made by the companies who sell lots of them but don't last very long.. I've only been using it for a short time, but i like the fact that it doesn't have a big base that takes up room on the counter since the charger plugs into the unit in the back. The built-in foil cutter on the top is very clever and works very well. The LED blue light built in is kind of cool when plugged in or when it is in use. The bottom of unit is very wide and stable for standing up on the counter and takes up very little space unlike the ones requiring a base. So far, so good. And delivery was very fast."
1417,5,I bought this for a close friend who collects Oz.  She loved it. People have commented on the witches face how it looks like the one from the movie.... very happy with this purchase
1418,3,"As far as comfort the mat is great, but the design is flawed because the diamond pattern it has is crooked."
1419,4,I like that this looks like a mini purse. It seems to insulate well so far. I just wish it had more room.
1420,5,"I have expensive knives, that I take very good care of. Knives are never thrown into a drawer to fend for themselves in this kitchen. This tray keeps my knives organized and the cutting edges sharp. I like this tray far better than a counter block."
1421,3,not something I will use very often  The recipes are so so.  The only thing  would mke in the thing are frozen bananas.
1422,5,I've never used silicone baking cups before so I was a bit skeptical!  First I tried them on homemade peanut butter cups.  They were the perfect size for a peanut butter cup mold!  Popped out easily.  Next I baked mini muffins in them and they turned out perfectly done.  I was impressed!<br /><br />Just turn them inside out and they are really easy to clean! I love that these are BPA free and also plan on using them for my next batch of homemade lotion bars.  They actually make a great mold for a lot of things and I'll be using them quite often in the future for sure!
1423,5,The product was well made and is just as the picture showed it. I would recommend this fun purchase for any Breaking Bad fan!
1424,1,"At the beginning, we were happy this pot is so light. However, we should realize it means it was not made of good quality glass and is not durable at all. In the first one month, the lid fell off when I cleaned it, and it broke since it was not attached to the tea pot body. Then, in the second month, the glass filter fell off when my fiance tried to clean it and glad it broke in the sink so she didn't get hurt by stepping on the broken glass...the tea pot is just so easy to get broken, both the tea pot body itself (the glass is rather thin!!), the lid and the filter. SO sad the return period has expired, otherwise it is totally a waste of money because you are going to break it sooner or later."
1425,5,"We liked the placement of the button you push to grind the pepper. It's on the front of the grinder, that's makes it easy to grind the pepper when your holding the grinder. Adjusting the grain of the pepper is too, just flip the grinder over and on the bottom you'll see a plus (+) sign and a minus (-) sign. all you have to do is turn the little knob in between the symbols to adjust.<br /><br />We've been using the Ozeri Artesio Electric Pepper Grinder for over a while now and it has worked every time we've used it, and it's still on the original batteries."
1426,5,"Great, making all my ground Peppers for my &#34;Red's Best Pure Beef Jerky&#34; in Louisville Kentucky. Some people want the really hot flavors and I can do them all now."
1427,2,"I was thrilled when I opened the box for this set.  On first look, it looked like a steal for the money.  It was a medium weight set with fairly thick bottoms.  I cooked a steak in the skillet--no problem.  The next day, I fixed bacon and found that the pieces on the edges cooked normally, but the center ones remained uncooked.  The grease also ran from the center over to the sides.  On closer look,  I noticed that the center of the pan had a raised area or bump. The pan was not apparently warped out the outside and sat level, so it looks like the inside of the pan was coming loose from the encapsulated base. I did not cook above low temperature at any time;  I am experienced on stainless steel cooking.  Another reviewer below had a similar experience, so I am afraid to continue using this set.  Maybe it was just one bad pan, but I don't want to take the chance."
1428,5,"This product was perfect for heaing water for hot drinks and for cooking ramen noodles.  The design is small so great for small spaces and the design is kinda of cool looking and not bulky. Great price, too!"
1429,5,"My wife does it.  It's quieter, smoother, faster.  And it was a lot less money. We had our last Cuisinart for 20 years"
1430,1,"This can opener is very cheaply made (cheap plastic) and design stinks to try to get can attached.  Sure enough due to the design it is very very hard to catch the can onto the blades so that it will run through.<br /><br />Not only that but it is also VERY loud.  I thought I'd get a better can opener than my old hamilton beach, which still works great but was dirty and won't come apart to clean due to age.<br /><br />I thought I could trust Black & Decker brand, I guess not. I bought this for 1/5th the price on Black Friday.  Not worth it.<br /><br />This can opener is sold elsewhere on this site and has very bad reviews."
1431,2,"I received this kettle as a Christmas present in December 2012.  I used it every day to heat up the water for my pour-over coffee, and up until yesterday, it worked great.  Heated up water quickly, worked like a charm every time.<br /><br />Yesterday, the lever on top that is used to open the lid....broke off.  You can only open the lid by basically tearing it open, which to me, renders it unusable.  I will be looking for a new, metallic kettle."
1432,5,These are awesome so far. We've been baking egg muffins in them and they are so much easier and healthier than spraying the pan and scrubbing it out. I want another set.
1433,5,"The Bundt brownies look professional.  About 20 minutes baking is enough. I melted chocolate, painted it in the well and attached different color M&M's after the brownies cooled.  I'm planning to use other cake batter too.  Love this!"
1434,2,These ended up being a lot larger than I thought they would be.  They really are not shot glasses.  Would not have bought if I understood the size.
1435,5,My husband loves this thermos! This is the best travel mug we have ever purchased. It keeps the coffee hot and fresh tasting for hours. I just bought him a second one and he takes both to work with him every day. We are in the middle of a polar vortex and yesterday one of these mugs sat in his work truck for an hour in 6 degree weather. He opened the lid to take a sip and the coffee was still very hot! Can't beat this travel mug and it doesn't leak!
1436,1,"on the third washing it cracked. Didn't do anything to cause it, I was very careful with it. Very disappointed in the quality."
1437,5,My son loooovd this Xmas gift. VERY easy to use. Only down side is cleaning. The seasoning for meats stick to the nooks and grooves. However with a scrub brush of some sort will make cleaning much easier. This machine is also very quiet. Great purchase!
1438,4,They were received on time.  I bought them because the butter knife I used the first time was very time consuming and messy. I have yet to use them but when I do I will update.
1439,4,These will definitely be easier to put them into water bottles! I love them and they're great for parties! WOOT
1440,5,"A great minimal, functional, durable bowl - aesthetically pleasing for any dinnerware set, and presents contents beautifully (for example: clear soups) - no problems with cracking or scratches. I'm a product designer, so I notice the smallest details about quality. Great buy."
1441,5,Pyrex is awesome all around. It is great to be excited about storage containers and dishes. I have had pyrex for about 2 years and it still looks brand new. There is no staining and the dishes look great too. I will never go back to plastic. I have even dropped a few pyrex dishes onto my tile floor and have yet to have any break or chip. Keep it up pyrex! :-)
1442,5,Husband loves them - (Christmas present).  Can't stop talking about them.  Recommends them to everyone in his Scotch group.  Just the right size.
1443,1,"While unpacking the item I noticed one of the turning wheels had the no stick layer peeling off, this is the second appliance I have purchased from Amazon with this problem and I can't imagine what the health risks are if these flakes mix with the food and then are ingested.  Additionally, the wheels do not turn smoothly rather they jump around and it's noisy.  I won't be purchasing cooking appliances from amazon anymore."
1444,1,"I liked the toaster oven until it stopped working today, seven months after I purchased it from amazon. It just won't go on."
1445,1,"I agree with the others! Velata is absolutely AMAZING! BUT do NOT pay more than $35-$40 for a warmer, (light bulb & 4 forks are included with warmers)  The price on this Amazon page is absolutely ridiculous! Go to [...] to get the correct prices! Note to owner.. you shouldn't scam people! Sad world these days!"
1446,5,"I am very elated I brought this product. I am a big tea drinker. It does keep my  tea hot for hours--6-9hrs. Also, I don't have to worry about the tea spilling in my bag. Great investment!!!!!"
1447,5,"loved the pan. Just remember that the hidden cost is in the lid that you will want to order after you receive this pan. I spent another $35 on the lid, but am very happy with the purchase. Excellent addition to any kitchen"
1448,5,High Quality and very sturdy grater - just what I was looking for! The only plastic piece is the top cover.
1449,2,I bought this several years ago and the motor burned out within 2 uses.. But called KitchenAid and they replaced it!
1450,4,"I ordered this because I was looking for  a pink cup that I had seen someone with for my daughter in law. I just liked the feminine look to it. It came in as a raspberry color, more like black raspberry ice cream. Almost like a purple. I am keeping it because it would be too hard to return it, which makes me think they do this on purpose.  My daughter in law was happy with it but it definitely is not pink as pictured."
1451,4,"Always liked corning ware.  This package was a deal by ordering the set.  Individually, they were much more expensive. Word"
1452,1,"I purchased this as an upgrade to the mini Keurig I had. Thinking it would be convenient to have a water reservoir, I spent the extra money.  From about the 8th use, it constantly tells me to add water even when the reservoir is full. It always tells me it needs to be rescaled even though I use purified water and make coffee about 2 times per week.  Basically, every time I use it, I need to unplug it and refill the water.  I'm really disappointed in this and hope that Amazon will replace even though purchased in October."
1453,5,I bought this for my BFF for Christmas and she loves it.  She initially only wanted one for pepper but now she says she loves it so much she is going to order one for salt.
1454,5,They are very nice and show the pictures clearly. Price is a bit higher for my proyect. I will use them in the future.
1455,5,Good quality fits perfect .  Daughter uses it all the time to bake cookiies and muffins .couldnt ask for  more for a toaster oven
1456,5,This freezer thermometer is working quite nicely in my chest freezer. It came when it was supposed to and looks as described.
1457,5,"Now that I have the Aerolatte frother, I can make a Latte at home or at work, and for far less than half the price of what I pay at the corner coffee joint. Thank You!"
1458,5,"I bought the 8&#34; 10&#34; and 12&#34; pans all with lids.They are a little expensive, but so far they're working good. Nothing sticks to them and when you want to wash. Just use a soft sponge with a little soap and  they're as clean as when you first bought them. It looks like they will last a long time......We'll see!!!"
1459,5,We previously owned non-stick cookware and were fairly happy with it but since we got this set and started using it we've been amazed at the ease of both cooking and cleanup. This cookware cleans up extremely well and there is no need to place them in the dishwasher and the food prepares extremely well. We would recommend this set for anyone who enjoys non-stick cooking with easy cleanups. We are extremely satisfied.
1460,5,"It's a bit ridiculous how hard it is to find a set of decently sized bowls with lids that are all dishwasher safe and not made with BPA or melamine, but I'm happy that my search led to this set. I didn't think I needed the colanders, but I've been surprised how much I've used them. And they all nest beautifully to take up a minimum of space. Great set!!!"
1461,5,"I got this for my girlfriend who absolutely is a Doctor who fanatic! Plus she collect Disney Mugs, so I figured I would put the two things together and it made a perfect gift. I would recommend it for any Doctor Who fan that drinks coffee and/or tear."
1462,5,"The only thing better would have been getting a new mixer.  Maybe for my birthday?  That's a hint, Ed & Sonshine!"
1463,5,"just the right size for my small oven and works great when I bake chicken, or warm up frozen chicken breats"
1464,5,This is a handy kitchen tool if you enjoy making pastries and desserts especially recipes calling for blending creme cheese and powdered sugar or other dry ingredients. Definitely can recommend this item!
1465,5,Great plastic coasters that serve their purpose. They look really nice and add color to my living room. I would recommend them.
1466,1,"Being old enough to remember rolling biscuit dough with an empty coca-cola bottle and cutting it with a glass, I have been dismayed to read the number of reviews that complain that a mixer is not also a bread machine, a food processor, a blender, and a mini-fridge. If I make bread, I knead the dough. As my mother taught me, when making cookies, I use a mixer only for the butter, sugar, eggs, and other wet ingredients. After adding the flour, I stir the dough with a spoon. I need my mixer to mix and that's what I expect it to do.<br /><br />I had for 15 or 16 years a small hand-held, Sunbeam mixer. It had no dough hooks. It was just a mixer and it worked beautifully. This Christmas 2013 my husband decided to bake his first batch of cookies ever while I was running errands. Though I told him he would have to mix the dough by hand after adding the flour, he opted to ignore me and burnt out the motor on my mixer.<br /><br />He replaced my mixer with this piece of cr@p.  There are no words adequate to express how much I despise this mixer. It is heavy and bulky. Those of you who actually know how to cook will want to know that this mixer will not mix! Ignore the reviews about how great the new design on the beaters is supposed to be. I am now convinced these are posted by individuals paid by the manufacturer or distributor. They are designed to skimp on metal in the beaters and save the manufacturer money on production. This sad fact became abundantly clear when I tried to make a cake. This mixer could not blend in the very soft butter. I was close to an emotional breakdown when I finally gave up and poured my butter-lumped batter into the pan.<br /><br />The manufacturer should be ashamed to sell this mixer. It is a disgrace. Do NOT Buy it."
1467,5,"I called Blendtec directly when my container broke.  The guy I spoke to was sooooo nice and friendly.  He asked me questions about the serial number, control numbers and dates in order to verify my item.  He said that they did not need me to send them the broken container but that they will send me a new container apparently at... get ready... NO CHARGE!  Ha!  How'do ya like that!<br /><br />I use the crap out of my Blendtec, but that's what it's for, right?  hehehe."
1468,1,"I bought this because the reviews were good and it was great, briefly, then it stopped working completely.  Waste of money!"
1469,5,"Spot on temperature measurement and a very fast reading time.  We've used this with pork, turkey, and chicken and it works really well."
1470,2,"If you purchase \\""stainless steel ice cubes\\"" like these, with the expectation that they can be used as a substitute for normal ice cubes, as is claimed by some sellers, you will be probably be greatly disappointed, as the metal cubes do a very poor job of cooling even very small volumes of liquid.<br /><br />Typically a generic product manufactured in Asia and sold by many different distributors, these 1\\"" square cubes have some kind of gel inside, which hardens when it gets cold.  When placed in a drink, the steel ice cubes are supposed to chill your drink, without diluting it.  In theory, this sounds like a good idea, however the ability of these metal cubes to effectively cool, is very limited.  While the steel ice does get nice and cold when frozen, for whatever reasons, that coldness doesn't seem to be transmitted to liquids very well.<br /><br />Sometimes called \\""whiskey stones\\"", it is often claimed that these metal cubes are effective with liquor, where smaller volumes are usually involved, and not having your drink diluted is usually desirable.  The standard 2 ounce shoot glass, can only hold one of these cubes.  I poured some liquor into a shot glass with one frozen cube, completely immersing the cube, and 5 minutes later, the results were disappointing, as the liquid was only slightly cooler.<br /><br />I put five of these cubes into a small glass, added 6 ounces of water at room temperature, and 5 minutes later, there was virtually no change in the temperature of the water.  The metal cubes add weight, and clinking them together in a thin-walled glass, could be dangerous.<br /><br />I also did some testing using a Contigo West Loop cup, which is a double insulated steel mug.  A container of this type is designed to keep hot liquids hot, and cold liquids cold.  Unfortunately, an insulated container didn't help much, as the metal ice cubes again did a poor job of cooling, even very small volumes of liquid.<br /><br />After conducting these tests, I got tired of lukewarm drinks, and went back to real ice.  The poor performance of these cubes, renders them practically useless.  I paid about $2 per 1\\"" cube, and unfortunately it was money completely wasted.of lukewarm drinks, and went back to real ice.  The poor performance of these cubes, renders them practically useless.  I paid about $2 per 1\\"" cube, and unfortunately it was money completely wasted."
1471,5,"Nothing broken, all parts were there.  I bought these for our upcoming wedding and this set was definitely the best deal on Amazon."
1472,5,"It's ergonomic, it firmly grabs a bottle cap and works perfectly, it's well made and just heavy enough so it does not feel cheap, it's made in the USA, it's attractive and it's very cool. Perfect trinket for the guy who has everything. This is the third &#34;From War to Peace&#34; product I've purchased and they all have met my expectations."
1473,5,"Looks great<br />Thick board very stable.<br />A pleasure to use.<br />Professional chef, certified meatcutter<br />This is expensive, but it is the real thing."
1474,5,My wife and I have sensitive stomachs to strong coffee often found in other countries. We usually throw a thermos and this filter holder and filters into our suitcase along with our favorite coffee and just make our own in the hotel room as so many in other countries have electric water kettles. It is sturdy and fits our thermos fine and we had no issues with it draining threw slowly.
1475,3,"Great little gift for the Bistro Chef lover in your life. It is a bit smaller than I expected, but fully functional."
1476,4,"Purchased this for a friend that loves owls.  Could not find exact dimensions online, but they were too cute to pass up.  They are smaller than I expected, but definitely a fun item for an owl lover to display."
1477,5,"These off brand flex sheets are very thin, and although they came in a tube, and were extremely hard to get out of that tube, they work very well. I purchased the excaliber D900S (stainless) and these fit fine. I haven't seen the excaliber parra flex so I can't really compare, but considering the price of $14 for 9, or $15 for one excaliber parra flex, these are great for me. I made a chicken,yogurt,apple leather for the dogs, and it peeled right off beautifully. The sheets just wiped right off clean. I will probably order an excaliber parra flex at some point in order to actually compare, but for now, I'm very happy with these."
1478,4,"I've used this tray for ice, homemade gummy snacks, and to freeze pesto and pureed vegetables. It has held up really well. It's fairly easy to remove the frozen pieces from the tray, although they need to be taken out individually (you can't &#34;pop&#34; them out as  with a rigid tray). When using it for ice, it's tricky to fill the compartments without leaving water beaded up on the flat top surface of the tray. I usually just put it in the freezer with droplets on it, and brush them off once they are frozen."
1479,5,I heard that this henkel knives set are very sharp and hard. I have not used this knives but im glad to buy it with cheap price. Yeah
1480,5,"I needed a second one of these for a different residence.  If you like to make apple pies, you HAVE to have one of these.  It makes peeling and slicing the apples so easy.  It is definitely worth the price.  When I retire and am only one home, then I'll have two and my husband and I can use them at the same time with our orchard apples.  Looking forward to that!"
1481,4,I havent used/washed these yet but they look just as pictured and are very pretty - I got them in both green and blue and am happy with both.
1482,5,This works so well I bought my son one for Christmas.  I will be saving a lot of money making my own Coffee Beverages.
1483,5,"We all know that air is what causes food to break down. The best way to keep your food fresh is to put it into a container with as little air as possible. That's where the Ozeri INSTAVAC Green Earth Food Storage Containers are unique! Once you fill your container with leftovers, or whatever you want to fill it with, you simply snap the sides of the lid down, and push down in the middle of the lid. You can actually hear the air being pushed out. The little silicone piece in the middle of the seal gets sucked down into the container to let you know the air is out. To open the lid, just pullup that green flap, then undo the flaps. If you decide to microwave your food, there is no reason to open the lid. Leave it closed so the food doesn't get sprayed all over your microwave if it happens to start popping. The valve keeps the container from blowing up, and keeps your microwave clean and safe."
1484,1,It lasted less than a week. The material is very brittle. It just cracked on the side in a weird way.
1485,4,"These are nice, deep casserole dishes.  The side handles are great, but the trade-off is you lose the 'topping' space of the shallower pans that have a larger footprint.  I didn't really think about it until I made macaroni and cheese in it - everyone always wants the crunchy topping, and there was considerably less of it available.  Not a deal-breaker, but I wouldn't use it again to bake something that has a stellar topping. They are probably going to see more action as serving pieces that oven-to-table, to that reason.<br /><br />Typical Pyrex quality - hefty, well made, glass covers fit nicely, more pleasing to the eye than the regular flat casserole dishes.  Overall, I'm pleased with this purchase."
1486,2,Absolutely not true. It sticks from day one. We tempered it exactly the way they said as well. It is a pretty good pan to have but if you think that it will work the way they show you on TV “forget it”. You always have to get under the food with a kitchen utensil for a bit and you definitely are not going to blow a piece of burnt cheese off it.
1487,5,"Not sure how well these work...a bottle of wine doesn't last long enough in my house for one of these to get use. They look great though, and are made solid!"
1488,5,I bought this for my son who is a Dallas Cowboys fan along with his 3 sons.  They like novelties like this so when I see something related to their sports team I'll buy it.
1489,5,I got these for a friend but of course we had to take them for a test spin.  The stone was soft so it didn't appear to harm the glass in any way and they chilled the bourbon we were drinking down a little bit.  If you are looking for a really cold drink I don't recommend these but they are not supposed to make your drink ice cold.  They also come with a nice carrying bag.
1490,5,"Nothing like a SUPER quick cup of perfectly brewed coffee or tea. I am in love with my new Keurig. I had bought an off-brand one-cupper prior to this and was sorely disappointed in its performance. Because of that experience I decided to bite the bullet and buy myself this model. This is perfect for me. It is easy to use, easy to fill, and easy to clean. No need to set up a pot of coffee the night before, count scoops of coffee, no need to set a timer of any kind any more. This baby gives me my morning &#34;brains in a cup&#34; in less than a minute....and then I am out the door."
1491,5,I'd support the makers of these GREEN pans on PRINCIPLE alone but these pans are terrific ~ light enough to handle but sturdy enough for all of your stove top needs.  I have the whole set :)
1492,1,Used these once is freezer & dishwasher. They are stained from food & bent after dishwasher. Dollar tree quality. Save your money. Buy ball freezer containers or snapware.
1493,1,I did not see any results with the It Works products.  The whole product line is a waste of money.
1494,3,The holes are too big and the coffee comes out weak. I am using it with a piece of cork plugging one of the two holes.
1495,5,"IN my opinion, this is the best Quesadilla Maker on the market.<br />Doesn't stick. Doesn't burn. YOu may buy one a tad cheaper but you<br />won't buy one any better. And you get what you pay for sometimes.<br />I bought one for my son and my daughter who are now grown and live<br />away from home. They use it to make breakfast sometimes, lunch sometimes,<br />and dinner sometimes. Even does dessert. Creative possibilties are endless."
1496,5,This made an excellent present for my friend who loves all appliances. She uses it all the time to make popcorn. Great for a family movie night.
1497,2,"They leak . . . wanted to use these in an RV for EVOO . . . filled them to about a half-inch below the lid . . . made sure they stayed upright and they leaked where the cap goes onto the bottle so be aware that every time you invert the bottle, you will have a mess."
1498,5,"I absolutely love this cooker! One pot spaghetti or chicken fettucini Alfredo?  How bad can that be? Wonderful time and dirty pot saver. Makes the best roast and most tender pork chops ever. My son actually eats pot roast now he just turned 13 and is a fairly picky eater. Hates pork too. Until now. And if you are on Facebook there is a wonderful page full of helpful individuals that are converting crock pot recipes to Ninja recipes. It's awesome. Look for Ninja 3-in-1 cooking system recipes. If I could afford it, I would buy a second one. I love it that much! Brown your meat and bake and slow cook in one pot. Awesome"
1499,4,"Nice pen, writes very well and it does the job when it comes to opening a bottle.  for the price, i would recommend it."
1500,5,The kids love to take a hot lunch to school on a cold day and these jars are perfect for that.
1501,4,"We make a lot of homemade yogurt, and I was excited to make yogurt cheese. The yogurt cheese turns out very well, and is easy and straightforward to make. Just dump the yogurt and whatever you would like to mix in into the mesh container, drop it into the outer container, seal the lid and stash it in the fridge. In just a few hours, you have yogurt cheese. My only complaint is that the mesh container can be difficult to clean."
1502,1,"You get what you pay for... these are very cheap, flimsy plastic.  The ends will not stay on, therefore, I threw them away."
1503,5,I was surprised at how quickly I received this.  Doughmakers Bakeware is great....someday I'm going to have to quit buying for gifts and buy more for me!  Easy cleanup and long lasting.
1504,2,I bought this to help me make awesome mashed potatoes and baby food. The results were nice but makes a huge mess! I feel like food gets everywhere. not impressed.
1505,5,"My wife had been making ham and egg muffins lately in our metal muffin pan, I washed it by hand twice and told her never again! I threw it in the garbage and ordered this, fantastic creation!  Cooks great and rinsed right out. And got a great price too"
1506,4,"This is a good quality grinder.  I hesitate to say it's excellent, because it's not a burr grinder (and does not purport to be) and hence it grinds the beans unevenly (which is not ideal for brewing via any method).  On the whole, though, it's well worth the price."
1507,4,"Overall a great unit.  Only disappointment is that the final drink is not very hot.  When I leave on a cold morning, the drink doesn't stay hot for long."
1508,5,Only used it to carve the turkey and prime rib for Thanksgiving but it worked great and was easy to clean.
1509,3,It is just okay. The strainer holes are way too big causing you to need to strain your tea before you can drink it.  Not good for on the go people.
1510,3,This set is beautiful and has been pretty good. The only problem is the mugs have cracked on us. One cracked while I was pouring hot coffee in it- split in 2 pieces. I am ordering more mugs because I like the set and replacing it all would be a pain. Buy it knowing you may have to add more pieces as they break.
1511,5,I love these covers. I have had mine for awhile now and they look great on my stove. I have regular burners on my stove so they hide my burners well and fit great. They seem pretty durable also. I have set hot stuff out of the oven on them and it doesn't seem to affect the paint on them or the finish.
1512,3,Cups arrived quickly and are perfect fit for my magic bullet.  I gave it theee stars though because one of my cups arrived cracked.
1513,4,"Grain Mill  Use<br /><br />As of now it is working great, but I find that on the coarse setting the screw tends to tighten up and it is hard to get  a granular type flour from the 7-grains I use.  All in all I am satisfied."
1514,5,Coffee taste great without chlorine. These also help slow the water to make the coffee maker function better. That is one reason I use them.
1515,5,Plenty of power & functions as advertised. Quality exceeds the other microwave ovens in the price range. Alert buzzers are very loud.
1516,5,"We have both this aerator and the often-mentioned Vinturi which costs $10 more.  This one is perhaps a little easier to use.... you just affix it to the bottle and pour, whereas the Vinturi you have to insert into a decanter or balance over a glass... so on convenience I give this little aerator a win.... on appearance, same thing, it sort of blends in and your guests likely won't comment on it... finally on performance... the Vinturi does seem to aerate more and I noticed a &#34;smoother&#34; taste but that's highly subjective.<br /><br />If you're looking for an economical alternative to the Vinturi or a more convenient alternative (great for a party) then this is a good buy!"
1517,4,"This is a good, middle-of-the-road blender.  We bought it mainly to make smoothies and it does that well. For the price, this is a very functional blender."
1518,5,Purchased two of these along with the &#34;Artisan (2 pk.) Non-Stick Silicon Baking Mat Set. 16 5/8&#34; x 11&#34; and the mats fit these PEFECTLY.  So pleased and these are great quality pans.
1519,5,"I like stainless steel cookware, like All Clad, but I like everything else in my kitchen to be white. I hate the cold, institutional look of stainless steel appliances. The grey color is depressing to me. There weren't many small, white toasters available. This fits the small space I have perfectly (my kitchen is very small, with a small counter) and it remains cool to the touch. On the down side, it toasts one side of your bread (or bagel) more than the other. This doesn't bother me at all, but thought I should mention it."
1520,5,"I have used all the attachments that came with the mixer. they work great, I love the steel bowl as well."
1521,4,Friend had 1 & was what I was looking for ! Had about 100 lbs of Walnuts & it does the trick in no time
1522,5,"This Frisper PRO-1000 Vacuum Sealer changed the way we handle leftovers! We own a small business that keeps us very busy and have very little time to cook regular meals, which can add a lot of stress and expense eating out. Now we (and by &#34;we&#34; I mean my wife) can cook additional portions and save the rest in vacuum sealed Frisper bags to us later in the week.<br /><br />Pros +<br />+ Easy to Use; took us a few minutes to figure out how to use the vacuum sealer and bags<br />+ Size; fits easily on the counter<br />+ Speed; works fast<br />+ Bags; these are thick and can be reused<br /><br />Cons -<br />- Expense; replacement bags are pricy<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good system that will save us a lot of money in the future!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH"
1523,3,"This 8-1/2 ounce MARINEX GLASS CUSTARD CUP is slightly larger than the small Pyrex custard cups that I've always used for baked custard.  However, it's still a very convenient size for single servings of custard, pudding, or ice cream.<br /><br />The Marinex brand is expensive, but superior to the present-day Pyrex brand, because Marinex glass cookware is made from borosilicate glass.  Borosilicate glass, which has a slight green tinge, is less susceptible to thermal shock than the tempered soda lime glass used by Pyrex.  (Years ago, Pyrex dishes were also made of borosilicate glass.)  I feel safer using glass cookware made with borosilicate glass, because some of my newer Pyrex dishes have shattered when they were removed from the oven and placed on a room-temperature, ceramic-tile countertop.  (Now I always place glass cookware on a hotpad or oven mitt.)<br /><br />When I ordered this item, I thought that the listing must be for four Marinex custard cups, because of the price (about $16).  In fact, I received just one custard cup, as the listing promises.  The single custard cup is a genuine Marinex custard cup, and it is identical to the ones in the four-cup set that I purchased from Amazon for about the same price (see [[ASIN:B008H07AQC Marinex Set of Four Glass Custard Cups, 8-1/2-Ounce]]).  Because this is a 5-star product with a 1-star price, I rate it at 3 stars (\\""It's okay\\"" on the official Amazon scale)."
1524,5,"Love these forks!  They are a great size for appetizers and I agree with other reviews, they are nice and heavy and I love their clean, simple design.  May have to buy the spoons now!"
1525,5,"Excellent quality. Good price. However, for my purposes, I'd prefer a 12 oz. size because it would fit perfectly in my purse."
1526,1,I replaced my old Krups with this machine and really regret it!  I've been using it every morning for about 6 months and it is very fussy.  As per others' comments the heating mechanism isn't accurate and it's constantly getting clogged.  I tried talking to Breville about it to see if I could return it or replace it but since there isn't anything technically wrong with the machine (other then poor design) they wouldn't help me.  The person I spoke with said it was essentially user error but the fact is I happily made espresso with my Krups for years and never had any problems!  Such a bummer to spend all that money and end up with a lame product.
1527,5,Makes great coffee without any additional taste. No need for paper filters and with regular cleaning it will last a few years.
1528,4,"I bought these to use in the base of some wine bottle coasters I'm turning from cherry to give as gifts.<br /><br />These are very nice and thick, dense with a refined curve along the side. The depression in the center isn't shown in the photo but is there.  Although that was a problem for my purpose, it's a well-finished detail, with no rough edges anywhere.<br /><br />Thick, good high quality.  Good price too."
1529,5,These dessert plates went really well with me Thanksgiving decorations on my dining room table.  They are so unique and cute.
1530,4,"I bought years ago and have moved & crusher keeps doing it's job!!! Make sure hit studs when installing - be careful for sharp can edges after crushing them, especially if stuck as does once & while. Over good product for good price to do good thing - recycling lots easier with this!!"
1531,4,"Love my steamer! I can steam a bunch of one type of food, or a few different types at once. When it is done steaming it beeps and then keeps the food kind of steamy until you are able to take it out, so you don't have to rush to take it out right away."
1532,1,"It leaks, no point in trying to keep things separate the stainless steel all leak inside the  thermos.  What a gross mess."
1533,4,"This burner was purchased for a breakroom to have something to cook food on other than a microwave. It performs just as I expected. It's a simple design, easy to clean, and impossible to operate incorrectly. The price is right and the build quality is fairly solid. It sits level and doesn't feel like it's going to fall apart like some of the others I've played with over the years.<br /><br />The only issue I have with it is that the element takes a while to heat and shuts off quickly. I know this is one of the downsides to cooking electric, but if you're trying to use a pan to cook a full breakfast (eggs, meat, french toast), you may run into an issue where you have to wait for it to kick back on before you can continue cooking. I have found that taking the pan off the burner and fanning it will trigger the burner to come back on, but in the meantime, your food cools down a bit. If you are only heating something up or cooking a quick item, you should have no issues with it."
1534,1,"The All-Clad Nonstick Frying Pan is by far the worst pan I have ever used. I bought a pair two years ago, and having used it less than two dozen times, the coating started to peel. I attempted to contact the All-Clad customer service for the so-called \\""Lifetime Warranty\\"" to no avail, as they failed to respond to my web request and do not have a phone number. In conclusion, the $130 pair of pans is worse than a $10 pan from Walmart. Stay away from All-Clad, it's a scam."
1535,5,Purchased as a Christmas gift for 10 year old grandson who is showing interest in meal preparation. I know from experience that the performance is excellent and clean-up is a snap.
1536,4,pretty shakers. My husband says he wants to drill more holes in lid but I don't have a problem with getting salt/pepper out. just might take a couple more shakes!
1537,3,"I was hoping for a press that got the tortilla thin, but this makes them pretty thick. I'll keep it and use it though. I use it for other things like pastry press as well."
1538,5,"This is a very nice tea box. I can fit 1 box of tea into two compartments, which means this thing holds about 4 new boxes of tea (but really, more, because most of us have partial boxes). The box is beautiful and sturdy. The clear lid is Plexiglas, so you don't have to worry about it breaking, and the hinges are a type that allow the lid to stay open so you can easily grab your tea without smashing your hand.<br />I'm going to order at least one more of these!"
1539,3,not so fast to filter water。may be have pole so not that good quality as i think but overall is usable
1540,5,white 3 x 4 white organza party favors or to store your small items or store jewelry<br />also great to use for gift giving...<br />this is great size to store for many things
1541,5,Worked like a charm and now my wife's heritage mixer is back in the game!
1542,3,"I was really hoping that it being a Foam Insulated Mug, it would keep my coffee hotter longer but it does not perform any better than the stainless mug I was using. A alternate reason, I got one that did not have any metal is so that I could stick it in the microwave to warm it up if I needed to. Well, unfortunately, this cup is way too tall for most standard Microwaves. Over all, I was pretty underwhelmed. Also, the hole on top to drink from is tiny. About half the size of a standard kidney bean. The part of the lid that slides to cover the hole is pretty poorly designed as well. It does not always slide well and the thumb piece is pretty flimsy. I would not buy this mug again."
1543,4,I find myself using all the time. The color coding is nice to keep foods separate for food safety purposes. Easy to clean and store.
1544,5,"I bought these to make sugar skulls for my SIL's wedding.  They came out perfect!  i also used Wilton Candy Melts, the skulls were gorgeous.  I love using silicone with the melts."
1545,5,This cup has been PERFECT with my hand blender! It's just the right size and holds a large quantity of liquids. Nothing flies out when you try to blend and the cup itself is very very easy to clean!
1546,1,"We bought this to use for a signature shot for our wedding reception.  Love the design, but that one and only time we used it, it leaked EVERYWHERE!  Unfortunately, I can't recommend this product."
1547,5,"Poacher works great, and being able to poach 6 eggs rather than 4 is a plus.  Forget about it being non-stick, however.  Spray with Pam and eggs will slide right out."
1548,4,This product is easy to use and my husband has found that you can put anything into it! Cooks roasts awesome and surprisingly cleans very easily! I would definitely recommend this product.
1549,3,with plastic ones it is all one piece so no food can get caught in connections.  it still works.  just a little irritating thing
1550,5,Love it. Organized the K cups so there are no boxes on the counters. Bought 2. 1 for coffee & 1 for tea. Stacks on one another easily. Slides open easily. Would highly recommend.
1551,5,I like the look and the new handle. It is a bit pricey but great to have our vitamix working again.
1552,3,"The maker gets hot quickly. Works quite well, but the problem is cleaning it thoroughly is next to impossible. I wish the plates came off so that I could wash them under the sink. Oh well."
1553,5,"I really like this slow cooker, it's a good size, easy to clean and looks very nice. I have used it several times since purchasing and it works like a champ. I would choose this again if I were looking for a new one."
1554,3,I wanted the a couple of long spoons to stir the ice tea with and these fit the bill.  Nothing fancy but very basic spoons that work.
1555,5,"product as advertised. Not being dishwasher safe is not good, but clean up is easy. Cooks great meals without having to use the outdoor grill."
1556,5,"We have had this juicer for about a month now.  We use it  practically on a daily basis.  We have used it to juice kale, spinach, celery, carrots, apples, pineapple, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, ginger, parsley, beets, beet greens and cucumber. we have used it to make salsa.  Some of the family liked the consistency, others didn't.  No big deal.  It does the job.  The main reason we got is was for its ability to handle the leafier greens, and it does so without even a hesitation.  This juicer is built to last, and  it is quite sturdy. The only thing I would change about it would be the size of the chute that you feed the produce through.  Apples have to be cut into small pieces, as well as the core needs to be removed to be able to fit through the chute.  However, I was aware of that when I ordered it, but thought it more important to get an additional 5 years on the warranty rather than just the same identical juicer in a different color.  I would definitely recommend it to someone looking to buy a juicer. I am going to experiment with it tonight and make some almond milk."
1557,5,"I was looking for a set of salt and pepper mills that were made in the USA and NOT China.  Hard to find!  Then I found the USA-made Vic Firth ones, and once again found that they were hard to find!  Not even Williams Sonoma had them in stock.  Thank you, Mario Batali, for selecting this set to put your name on.  I wanted black, and got them.  They work great, and the best part is that they are not the usual Chinese junk (that I seem to have kept using and discarding) and are actually very good quality.  They work great and look nice, and I and my family are more than pleased with them.  Would definitely recommend them."
1558,5,These bags are a little more expensive than using the rolls but much quicker and eaiser to use. love them
1559,5,"this product works well.  Its a great conversation piece at any party.<br /><br />I tried putting fruit inside (raspberry), it doesn't look as cool as the picture did.  i'll try it again with a different item like blue berries."
1560,5,Bought this so I wouldn't have to use paper filters.  I use Starbucks Medium roast ground fine and it works perfectly!
1561,5,Just saw/used these for the first time a month ago.  A fantastic concept; fits perfect in hand.  I'd definitely recommend these to friends and family.  I great idea!
1562,5,I used the stones directly on my gas grill my pizzas turned perfect.<br />I would recommend the stones<br />I also like they are small & easy to store.
1563,5,The skillet is wonderful.  It is everything that I expected.  I love that it is so deep and so easy to clean
1564,5,"I would never had thought a ladle would make such a difference in the canning process, but I was wrong - this ladle makes filling canning jars so much easier, even if you don't use a funnel."
1565,4,This product works wonderfully. When yiu don't have a rotating Microwave Nordic is the next best thing. I Love It
1566,4,"Nothing particularly fancy about this, but it does the job well and it's very :clean looking&#34;. I'd recommend this item."
1567,4,They were what I expected...good quality.  Time will tell how they last but they appear well made and so far I'm happy.
1568,3,"There is nothing wrong with the funnel, it appears adequately well made.  What the heck everything is made in China.  But I'll be darned if I can see anywhere on the page for this thing that it comes from Hong Kong.  Three weeks!"
1569,5,"Product was delivered on time, as advertised. Product had no issues...glass was the standard beaker type glass.<br />I would recommend this product"
1570,5,"I love this thing!! I can now make delicious pasta in 12 minutes, and a cup of white rice in 22 minutes.<br /><br />This is an amazing invention that has saved me so much time. I would recommend this to anyone.<br /><br />My friends are all amazed on how good I can make pasta now. Add some oil and salt to the water, and you got yourself delicious pasta/rice in an instant. The food tastes very good, which I found very surprising coming from the microwave."
1571,5,I have the measuring cups too and these just go right along with them in my kitchen. Smiley faces rule!
1572,4,"This toaster oven is great for small jobs. The picture of the pizza cooking in this toaster oven is very deceiving because only a small personal-sized pizza no larger than 9\\"" x 10\\"" will fit. The depth (front to back) is 11-1/2\\"" if you include the handle and knobs on back; width is 15-1/2\\""; and height is 9\\"". The cord length is 33\\"".<br /><br />This toaster will easily fit four slices of bread.  I toasted two slices of rye bread and the toast came out fantastic; crisp and dry the way rye bread usually toasts. It was toasted evenly on both sides except that the bottom sides of the bread had the rack lines, which is expected. It actually toasted better than any actual toaster I've ever owned and I always disliked using a toaster oven to toast bread.<br /><br />Below are the PROS and CONS from my perspective.<br /><br />PROS<br />It has a small footprint.<br /><br />The top comes off easily for washing.<br /><br />The unit's roll top makes it easy to reach what is cooking.<br /><br />The price is reasonable in my opinion.<br /><br />It toasts very well.<br /><br />It comes with a crumb tray, rack, and baking pan that can be easily removed and cleaned.<br /><br />A broiling option is available by using the high rack position in the oven and selecting the broil feature.<br /><br />CONS:<br />The dials use mechanical timing so for the duration of the toasting cycle, there's a ticking sound from the timer.<br /><br />The timer always has to be rotated beyond 10 minutes and then turned back to the time desired if the cooking, broiling, or toasting time is less than 10 minutes.<br /><br />The timer has a maximum capacity of 30 minutes so if what's being cooked requires a longer time, it will have to be set two or three times during the cooking process.<br /><br />The silver \\""paint\\"" on the dial faceplate is slightly bubbled on the unit I received for review.<br /><br />In summary, I think this is a great buy for those who need a toaster oven for small jobs or do not have much kitchen space. It's also cute, squat, and retro looking.tchen space. It's also cute, squat, and retro looking."
1573,5,"I bought this thinking it was a very basic Bodum glass press but the glass section is surrounded by a tough clear plastic surround that slips off for cleaning.  I find myself taking it when I travel it's so tough.  Other than that its the same old fool proof 1 liter Bodum french press everyone loves.  adding additional comment 6/2014:  I just accidentally knocked this off of the kitchen counter.  I knew instantly it would shatter, but it didn't. It bounced!"
1574,4,Good product but quite expensive and hard to clean. Takes about 20 minutes to clean. Other than that I'm pleased.  Makes great juice.
1575,1,pour spout will not stay in bottle. stopper gets stuck in spout pulls spout completely out of bottle do yourself a favor buy something else
1576,5,"I have to say that I am quite impressed with this rubbermaid product!  I have purchased all sorts of bento style boxes that are all the rage: Some leak and some just don't fit in my daughter's lunch boxes - annoying!  These Rubbermaid boxes and ice block were obviously designed specifically for a child-size lunch box.  We have several soft-sided lunch boxes and this fits into all of them... sometimes stacked high as shown in the picture, or with a smaller box by the side of the large box.  They just simply \\""work\\""!  I have used the sandwich box (on the bottom) to pack yogurt with fruit and granola and it has not leaked out.  This box also keeps sandwiches from getting squished by heavier objects, which is much appreciated by my daughter.  Who, by the way, (at 5 years old) can actually open and close these by themselves...  Score!  I also have to pack 2 snacks for my daughter to take to school, so the smaller boxes on the top work perfectly to hold a serving of fruit,  some pretzel rods, or dried fruit and nuts.  The ice block is just the right size.  It keeps things cold and doesn't take up too much room.  OH!  And if you are still looking for the \\""perfect\\"" water bottle (one that your young child can open and close by themselves WITHOUT leaking...)  I found Ecc o Vess el BPA free water bottles are IT.  I'm about to go write a review for them, I am THAT happy about my new lunch box success.  ;)"
1577,1,I was disappointed when I received the molds. The product I received was unfinished wood with some splinters in the part where the cookie/mooncake would be pressed in. The mold will make about a 1-1.5 inch mooncake. The mold is very small and looks nothing like the picture. I'm stuck with this since postage to send it back will more than the cost of the item itself.
1578,5,"Omg... this is a god sent.. my kids can take it to school with no leaking, sweating easy use for my little guy... love it.."
1579,3,"The trays were smaller than I expected, haven't actually gotten out my ruler to measure, but I don't think they yield a full 2&#34; x 2&#34; x 2&#34; cube, but the problem is really with the material they're made of, haven't quite figured out how to make them release.  Overall, the trays are okay, I'll use them, but wouldn't necessarily recommed them to anyone else."
1580,5,"Since I got these molds, everyone admires my big balls of ice. When I take a dram, I drop one in the glass and pour the whiskey over. My big ball of ice keeps it cool, but not dilute. Looks cool too."
1581,3,"OK I have to say this machine has lots of power. But, only after a couple of months the housing in the stick blender developed two cracks and the plastic gear in the top of the stick got chewed up by the motor drive. Also blades come into contact with the bottom surface of the vessel that you are blending in. Leaving odd shaped designs on my saucepans.<br /><br />I contacted the distributor about this and was told they do not deal with Canadian customers. A little disappointed in this reply.<br /><br />Contacted Amazon.com who made arraignments for a new one. The only down side to this was the cheapest price to ship unit back to Amazon was 28.00 and I only received an 8 dollar credit.<br /><br />But like I side earlier this unit is very powerful, but I am still concerned with the high power output, if the small plastic cog in the stick blender can hold up."
1582,4,"Fred and Friends have made a really nice stylus if you are in the market for a unique stylus for your tablet or other device. I ordered this item to use with  my Kindle Fire HD and am very happy with my purchase. If  this stylus was only slightly longer,  it would be more comfortable to use and I would have rated it five stars."
1583,5,"Really like this, once I learned the right way to use it.  Instructions weren't really clear even though there were pictures.  Sometimes pictures can be deceiving.  Anyway, I'm having all kinds of fun vacum packing food I buy out of BJ's Wholesale in bulk."
1584,5,"Very practical since I am the only coffee drinker in the house. Even if there are two of us, it brews in an instant highly recommend it & because of it's size, it take up very little counter room,"
1585,5,"This dehydrator was a gift for my husband's daughter so I can not say much about the packaging or shipping of this unit. However, I have already had feedback on the product from the new owner and I know it arrived in good working order.<br /><br />I chose this Nesco because it was very similar to the Nesco dehydrator I bought for myself last year, also from Amazon.<br /><br />Our daughter tasted my dried apples on a recent visit and after she received her gift, the first thing she dehydrated were apples.....she wrote to let us know that hers &#34;were not quite as tasty&#34; as those she ate while visiting us. It was the variety of apples...mine were a sweeter variety.<br /><br />She is thrilled with the ease of use and has dried other items since &#34;the apples&#34;.<br /><br />I would reccomend the Nesco line of dehydrators to anyone. I currently own two of the Nesco dehydrators and both of them are giving excellent results."
1586,4,This works great.  Use it for out cottage sink.  Didn't want to spend too much money.  Does exactly what it says it would do.
1587,5,"I love this brush. I used to use the older one before, - wooden with bristles. But the negative part was, sometimes it was hard for me to wash the older brush (to clean all the hairs on the brush thoroughly), and sometimes the hairs would come out of it. With this brush, - it's much easier to clean, and I don't worry about hairs getting on to products that I use the brush on!"
1588,5,"Such an adorable and well organized package of cupcake accessories!  I made Queen Victoria Sponge cupcakes that have a jam in the center, so these were on the small side to accommodate two layers of batter and one of jam. They also looked small in the holes of the muffin tin we used, but maybe it's good for this American to eat a slightly smaller portion! The baked cupcakes looked amazing out of the oven and the decorative toothpicks really took the treats to a whole other level. PRO TIP: once used, you can keep the decorative tops and discard the actual toothpick.  Next time, reuse the tops on any generic toothpick.<br /><br />In summation, these were stars of the party and completely worth it for the price."
1589,1,Ordered from &#34;Kitchen Deal&#34; (on Amazon) 5 months ago.  Worked great and then the motor died (or something - it refuses to start).  No problem right - after all its still under the 1year warranty.  Ha!  According to Nutribullet the warranty is not valid because &#34;Kitchen Deal&#34; is an unauthorized vendor.  Huh?  Nothing on Amazon stated the warranty was void.<br /><br />Quick search shows many others having same issue -- both with defects and then while attempting to get the warranty honored.<br /><br />Stay away.
1590,5,"For those who are willing to attach a special and longer silver aerator to their faucet, this is a great system for filtered water.  The water is forced through the filter which makes it cleaner than the ones you just pour into the pitcher.  They claim that makes it purer.  I liked the water taste, and I'm picky.  It makes a quick pitcher of water.  The water filters last about a month with normal use.  The quality is consistent."
1591,5,"I wanted a glass pitcher with a cover, not too heavy, for keeping ice water in<br />my refridgerator.  This has been perfect.  Have used for over a year now."
1592,5,These made me smile as I remember drinking Bud Lights down south on a fabulous vacation.  All part of a good memory.
1593,5,Great product made in the USA.  I use it for cooking and it does the job very well.  I would highly recommend for the cooks out there!
1594,5,"great pan, better buy than ordering a ready made giant cupcake. Remember not to use spray on non-stick pans, use crisco or butter for the most success."
1595,5,"Great workmanship. I'm going with this line for everything baking. Heavy metal, for the serious baker. Impossible to find in stores"
1596,5,"This product appears to be well made, it looks great and I look forward to using it.  So far, it is exactly what I wanted at a great price.  Thank you Amazon!"
1597,2,I purchased this thinking I might like it better than my Pampered Chef garlic press.  That was an error.  This thing doesn't work that well and I have to peel the garlic cloves first.  It cleans up nicely in the dishwasher but I find that when I use it the cloves don't get evenly pulverized.  I wouldn't buy this again.
1598,5,I use it to hold my bills to be paid. It's heavy enough that it doesn't move around. Very nice!
1599,5,"I use these instead of getting disposable, plastic straws when I get food out. They're durable and easy to clean too!"
1600,5,"I purchased this model for my wife, but have been the exclusive user since.  You can make just about anything you can imagine, simply make something that taste good, and pour it in.  I add a small touch of home made vanilla where appropriate, or some alcohol (drinking kind) and this helps keep ice crystals down."
1601,5,"I bought a set for my family and my parents, we travel a lot. We use them all the time, it has been great. I would totally recommend them to someone who travels or eats out a lot. No more plastic."
1602,4,"We've had this neat little rice cooker for close to a month now and are really happy with the purchase. Thus far I've tried the brown rice, mixed rice, porridge, cake and delay functions. We are Asians and have rice daily, and the brown rice comes out perfectly every time. I tried mixed rice and incorporated way more ingredients (chicken, chinese sausages, mushrooms, cabbage etc) than what the manual says and it came out well-cooked too, because the fuzzy logic automatically adjusts for cooking time. My white rice porridge mixed with pork, dried oysters & century eggs turned out much moister (compared to stove-top cooking), & smooth too (although not as fine as the usual cantonese porridge). I used the cake function for a Japanese cheesecake recipe (which is also included in the manual) and it turned out perfectly light and yummy!<br /><br />My only complaints, to nit-pick, are:<br />1) the lengthy cooking time (1.5 hrs for brown rice), so you do have to start cooking early or set the delay timer to make sure u finish cooking by a certain time; and<br />2) I can't seem to extend the cook time after the cooker is done cooking, probably because it has its logic to determine that food is already cooked to perfection!<br /><br />Other things to note, which I didn't know before the purchase are:<br />1) the capacity for white rice porridge is only 1.5 cups (that's the max marker indicated in the inner pot);<br />2) the manual says u can't mix white and brown rice for cooking together;<br />3) the \\""reheat\\"" function is meant for reheating rice in the pot that was previously in the \\""keep warm\\"" mode. I thought it could reheat rice left overnight in the fridge, but I haven't tested what happens if I try to reheat cold rice."
1603,2,had to return item for I purchased it for my mother and was not what she wanted.<br />I guess the product is alright for others.
1604,5,This bundt pan meet all my expectations as always  I am very satisfied with nordic ware brand. I definitely recommend it.
1605,5,"I purchased this unit to make coconut milk, but there is a lack of instruction from the manufacturer for coconut milk. My first attempts with the Soyajoy G4 were not that successful as the coconut milk came out thin and watery.  After much trial and error I believe I have the method for making great coconut milk.  You'll need the following products, all of which I was able to purchase from Amazon. 1) Bob's Red Mill Unsweetened Coconut Flakes, 2) Bormioli Rocco Frigoverre Jug with Hermetic Lid, 3) Cheesecloth or similar such as Gourmet Classics 32x38 White Jumbo Flour Sack Towels.  I use 2.5 to 3 cups of coconut flakes in my Soyajoy G4, fill with water to the proper level as shown inside the Soyajoy container, then the key is to process 3 or 4 cycles on the raw juice setting.  You have to turn off the unit by removing the plug in order to start another cycle.  I've found that the more cycles the better.  Then I pour the coconut milk through the cheesecloth into a wide and deep bowl.  You really need two people for this part, one to hold the cheesecloth over the bowl to keep it from slipping, and another to pour the milk from the Soyajoy into the very tight cheesecloth and push the contents around with a big spoon in order to get it to drain through.  It will take a few minutes, but after most of the liquid has been drained through, you need to gather the cheesecloth together and squeeze into the bowl the thick coconut pulp, the okara, that's left behind.  There is a lot of liquid milk in the okara.  Depending on the size of the wide bowl, it takes me at least two pours from the Soyajoy to process all the milk through the cheesecloth. I then transfer the coconut milk from the bowl to the Bormioli pitcher.  Then, if desired, sweeten to taste. I use about 3 Splendas, and sometimes a little Agave syrup. I also add about 3/4 teaspoon of fresh vanilla.  This makes a delicious coconut milk which I add to my morning coffee,  use for making rich and creamy smoothies or mix with Ghirardelli Unsweetened Cocoa to make a delicious hot chocolate.  Be sure to refrigerate the coconut milk.  You can expect a small, hard cap to form over the top.  I just shake the pitcher before using.  The cap should break up into smaller pieces which melt into my morning coffee, making it rich and creamy. I use coconut milk every day and this process makes enough for a week.th Ghirardelli Unsweetened Cocoa to make a delicious hot chocolate.  Be sure to refrigerate the coconut milk.

1606,5,"I recently purchased this wine opener since the one I previously had, stopped working. This wine opener has been great so far. It works great even with the artificial corks. I am very pleased with this product and highly recommend it."
1607,3,"The bowl is beautiful, although it has a small scratch on the rim handle.  A wedding gift, so no time to return and exchange.  Also not happy that a Nambe care insert did not come with it. If I had ordered directly from Nambe, that wouldn't have happened.  Not sure saving a couple dollars was worth it."
1608,5,I love thses and have ordered them several times.  I like that they're so easy to fill.  I like to use these to make lavendar bags and then leave them in closets so that clothes keep smelling fresh - or put them in tubs where you store winter/summer clothes in off seasons.  They're absolutely perfect and I plan to order them again!
1609,5,Arrived on time<br />Product as advertised<br />Information about product was helpful in this choice<br />Recomended to other buyers who might want a simple scale without commercial use
1610,5,I love this little oven.  I have an Amana double over and have had nothing but trouble with it since we bought it.  This over has taken it's place and out performed it.
1611,5,"Compact and takes less space on your counter.  Toasted different types of bread, and they all came out perfect with the right setting.  It's a cool toaster."
1612,5,This canner has performed as promised.  Easy to work and can actually do 8 jars when working with pints.  I have more than gotten my money out of it already.
1613,4,"I've been wanting a bento for awhile, and this one of the best ones that I've seen that isn't too childish or but is still cute and has some of the things I've been looking for.<br /><br />Pros: the two-tier design is both big enough and small enough for adults wanting to watch their portion sizes, and it should be big enough for growing children. The elastic strap keeps the two tiers together quite well. After placing the bento into the bag, there's still a little bit of room for chopsticks and/or a pudding cup or juice box.<br /><br />Cons:  I wish it were dishwasher and microwave safe. I also wish it came with a small pair of chopsticks like some of the other two-tiered bentos do. The divider in the smaller tier isn't very snug against the sides and, but I guess that's okay, since food will be keeping it in place. I haven't used it yet, so I really don't have much else to say about it."
1614,4,"This is quite possibly the best manual can opener that I've ever used. It glides effortlessly around the entire can, even the seem. I gave it a 4 because it does have some sharp edges on the handle that you need to be careful of. I intend to get some more of these to give to family members."
1615,5,I just got my second set of drying mats. I had my first ones for a year and a half before they started to wear out and have a few mold spots. They really do hold a lot of water and dry out quickly when hung up to dry.
1616,5,"I've opened an assortment of different size cans and so far so good. It's easy to turn, and I'm hoping it'll last for years to come.I'm tired  of throwing away!"
1617,5,"Made &#34;milk shake&#34; cup cakes with them - put a straw in them, gumball for the &#34;cherry&#34; on top, and sprinkles - adorable!"
1618,5,They arrived on time and were just what i wanted.We have a small B class Motor home and space is short.<br />These bowls are great for storage.
1619,5,"Water can not put too much.Ice is very beautiful!Which put even more beautiful fruit.10 filled with a little bit more, a refrigerator fit."
1620,3,I have been using this brand for past one year. The water tastes good similar to RO purified water. Good
1621,1,"I purchased this item based on the information provided, however when I received it the product clearly states \\""Do not use in conventional oven. Do not use as a hotpad for hot dishes.\\""  I wanted a rack I could cook on as well as cool on.  This one doesn't work for me."
1622,5,"Very Good, I like this product. Hope the all people like it. I do don know how to address it"
1623,4,This is probably the best squeezer I've ever used.  The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that it is a bit small for the large lemons or regular size oranges.  Best for average size lemons and rather small oranges.  The quality of the squeezer is better than I anticipated.
1624,5,"Was very surprised when picked it up out of the box and the handle fit the hand well and felt very, very comfortable."
1625,4,What can one say about a set of measuring spoons...?  They work like you would expect measuring spoons to work.  Except these are made of red plastic.  It goes with the decor of the kitchen that way... :)
1626,5,"These are small but will work for me.  I will mostly to poor my homemade vanilla extract into smaller bottles and of course, anything else that may need to be poured into a contained and not all over the counter top."
1627,5,Sent as gift. Got a very quick thank you for the &#34;Adorable Mug&#34;. Would highly recommend. Will order another for us.
1628,5,"Better than pouring without measurements, purchased and not part of my bar essentials, measures a 1 oz pour, great by not over doing drinks."
1629,5,"I didn't get this to filter water from a drinking fountain or any water that doesn't taste like crap, this is for making sink water that gets that milky white color taste more like filtered water.  Since its not a large filter with carbon and all in it.  It wont taste like my brita water, but it was affordable, works as described, and doesn't leak."
1630,5,"I've written a lot of reviews for kitchen items. When it comes to Pyrex items, it's always easy because Pyrex makes insanely high quality products. This measuring cup is no exception. It won't wear, it won't cause any problems, and it won't chip or break. Just don't drop it on concrete and you'll be golden.<br /><br />Verdict: Buy two."
1631,5,"A fraction of the price of the identically designed knife by CUTCO and just as good. However, it fails to improve the taste of the cheese :)"
1632,5,Elegant design with quality glass. Works very well as a decanter that can be placed on the table for serving two people.
1633,2,"It only works if you try to open the bottle 4 or 5 times, but it look good in my keys"
1634,3,"recieved the items and opened them up, the fork is the size of a lobster fork, very small and the spoon is basically a tsp size. the chopsticks are of good light wieght material. well work the price. They will work for the temporary indulgence of my daughter till she learns to use the chopsticks better."
1635,5,I even got a compliment from the lady at the party store when I stopped by to have them filled. She was kind of sad that they didn't offer anything as cute. I am soo happy I purchased these balloons!!
1636,5,"I ordered this machine and so far am quite pleased.  I have never done juicing before but have been interested for a while and read quite a few reviews for different juicers.<br />I just got it today and tried it out.  Here are my first impressions:<br />Very solidly built:  The motor base is hefty, powerful and quiet.  The main assembly, while plastic, seems to be of good quality - similar to a cuisinart.<br />Well designed:  All the parts fit together snugly and the overall impression is that the design was well thought out.<br />It's not bad looking either.  Wish it were a little smaller - the main basin is a little wide - but otherwise fine.<br />Clean up was pretty easy.  Mostly just rinsing the plastic parts with water.  As others have noted, the grater/blade could easily get clogged.  The key is to clean it right away while things are still moist (they give you a brush for this purpose).<br />Again, my first day but, based on my first impressions and the reviews from people saying they have had it for a couple of years and are still happy, I feel that I made the right choice.<br />You can't beat the price."
1637,5,This is a great knife and a great shower gift if know anyone getting married in the near future. The delivery is fast.
1638,5,These canisters look better in person. Well made and seal tightly. Colors work well with our kitchen.<br />Definitely would reorder.
1639,5,"This is a very heavy-duty well made board. It's manufactured by The Bally Block Company in Michigan of solid maple wood. I can't imagine that I'll ever need to purchase another cutting board as this one should last me a lifetime. I also purchased Emmet's Elixir for Cutting Boards, also made by the Bally Block Company. I would highly suggest conditioning the board prior to use (and regularly thereafter) to help maintain the board's lustrous wood."
1640,5,Easy way to vacuum pack at home. The hand pump and battery powered type work on these bags. Very cost effective. Easy to use. Just keep area where pump fits clean while pumping.
1641,5,"Really keeps herbs fresh for a long time. I have 2 for summers bounty!  Don't add water as suggested, makes herbs too wet and prone to mold"
1642,5,"I love the Original Shammys. I always have them on hand, in the house and BOTH CARS. They are essential for vehicles. Don't get fooled by impostors though. These really do absorb, quickly and completely. Don't use dryer sheet or fabric softener in wash."
1643,5,"I really loved my old Aeroccino frother, but I love my new Breville frother more.  I have a soy latte every morning.  My main complaint with the Aeroccino was the little burn spot on the bottom that kept getting worse, also didn't like the fact it wasn't dishwasher safe, so I decided to try something else.  I read lots of reviews and decided on the Breville.  The Breville is a little noisier and takes a bit longer, but otherwise performs better in every category that is important to me.  I use the latte disc and 8 ounces of soy milk, and it gives me nice hot milk with lots more and longer lasting foam.  However I do have to say, when I make two lattes at once with 16 ounces of milk, while it's nice to have that option, it does take quite a while to heat and there is less foam.  The temperature adjustment feature is nice, love that you can throw the top in the dishwasher.  Not sure why the light has to flash the whole time it's heating, but that's not a big deal obviously."
1644,4,We use it for the kids but it is smaller than a regular pin.  The silicone keeps it from sticking to dough.<br />Hags
1645,5,I have used this to make zucchini spaghetti for one raw spaghetti recipe and sliced potatoes for soup and so far I love it.<br /><br />Arlean Kelley
1646,3,The stone it's made of is absorbant enough but the size is tiny.  Could have been an inch or so more in diameter so I don't know what car would have such a small cup holder.  But it's fine for the job.
1647,5,"I seem to make a mess while cooking omelets. My son suggested purchasing this type of pan. I did my research and this seemed to come out on top for a reasonable prices. My omelets taste good enough now that we aren't even tempted to go out for breakfast, restaurant eggs just don't compare."
1648,5,"Great product for the Keurig to sit on. It holds alot of cups, and will never sag from the weight of the Keurig Coffee dispenser."
1649,5,Works Great!  Easy to fill.  Easy to extract.<br />Follow the instructions.<br />Made well.<br />Makes only four.  You may want additional molds.
1650,5,"I have a few of these lunch boxes for the kids, they are great and the easylunchboxes fit perfectly in them with space for another snack and drink."
1651,3,The look is OK but it is cheaply made.  The bottom looks like wood but is plastic and poorly poured.  The bottom is warped and does not sit flat on the table on the 3 felt dots that they use to hide the screws.  I added 5 silicone dots to the bottom and it now works fine.  Jury is out as to whether it is worth the price.
1652,1,"We purchases 2 of these. One died in 3 years, the other in 13 months (just out of the 1 year warranty period). Do not buy! A complete waste of time and money."
1653,5,"This is the best looking breadbox I have come across. It is stylish looking and roomy enough to hold two loaves of bread with some room left over. It has a sturdy, quality feel to it. Another thing that I liked was that it has a fairly low profile and being that it is flat on top, you can stack things on top of it. Another great thing was that the top of it happened to end right before my outlet cover. It looks like it was made for my kitchen."
1654,2,this product left me with just a feel of ok it barley does what it is made to do. and does nothing special there is no wow factor here !
1655,5,"This press easily makes the best coffee. Very solid, but light weight. Would recommend it to anyone who loves coffee."
1656,5,"I've had several waffle makers and this one is by far the best for my needs.  It's sturdy, yet lightweight and easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to store in a small area."
1657,5,"Just what I needed for my non  stick pans, does not curl  out of shape the way the nylon turners do, so well worth the extra cost."
1658,5,My friend recently got a bulldog so this just made her day.  Thanks again for selling a great item !!
1659,2,"This product worked great at first, but not even a year of use the cord won't retract and it makes an awful grinding nose. For only using it 2-3 times a week, seems pretty cheap for breaking down this soon."
1660,5,Make smoothies and freeze them in here.  Even my 1.5 yr old can handle this!  Going to have to buy a couple more though once school starts back so I can pack them in lunchboxes!
1661,5,These are great.  They are not attached to the stand so after they are frozen you can store them however you want.  Another nice thing about that is that you can start making new pops before going through all of the others.  They are very easy to come out and clean very well.  I had some sticky juice in the tip of one and just swirled warm water and the whole glob rinsed away.  I have only used these to make popsicles from some fruit juice that was not being consumed.  I bought them to make pudding pops but have not done so yet.  If it does not work for that I will update this review.
1662,1,Tried using this and was very disappointed.  Our coffee grounds would overflow and end up in our coffee.  No recommendations.
1663,4,This Popsicle maker works great because you don't have to run the entire holder under hot water and struggle with getting the individual pops out.  Each pop has a a silicone sleeve that just slips off and can be cleaned separately.  It is short and stable compared to other makers so their is less of a chance of knocking it over.  I was thinking about getting [[ASIN:B00CDL3538 Zoku Slow Pops: Mini Pop Molds]] so my kids get used to smaller servings.  The mini model does not have the removable silicone sleeves... they appear to be molded into the base which could be good too.  The pops this model makes are borderline too big but some people complain the mini model's are too small.
1664,5,"Good snug fit, no longer worry about burning my hands on the pot while making a cup of tea*. I do hand wash this pot since I added the grip as taking the handle off and putting it back on again is too much hassle, and I don't want water lingering inside the handle.<br /><br />*Well, I do worry about burning my hand on the *lid* now, but that's another story. :)"
1665,2,"Bought this oven to replace a cheap, ugly one I bought at Wal-Mart or Target 3 years ago (it still worked, just wasn't pretty anymore).  At first I really loved this toaster oven, but then one day it started burning EVERYTHING.  I was making wontons and they turned black after 5 minutes and started to smoke.  I had made the same exact thing the day before with the same settings and they had taken 15 - 20 minutes to cook.  From that day on everything burns within minutes of being in the toaster, even with the temperature set to it's minimum.  If I set it to toast and put it up to maximum temperature it feels like the air coming out could singe my eyelashes off!  Definitely not worth the money I spent on it.  Would not recommend."
1666,1,"I should've read the negative reviews first - the Clever Coffee that was delivered had a (S) on the box, not represented in the picture or item information.  Presumably for Small, because it was tiny- not even enough for a full large cup of coffee.  Will have to return it and find another seller."
1667,5,I love this skillet!  I have used it several times and have never been dissapointed.  It heats up evenly. The sides are high so spilling is never an issue. It's great for parties as the temperature can be adjusted to keep the food warm and it doesn't take up a great deal of space.
1668,5,"We brought it for gift to one of professors. It really looks like professional! It was our great decision! If I'll have another chance to buy it, I'm gonna definitely get it again!"
1669,3,"This bacon tray worked as advertised. If you load it up, the cooking time can be a little longer than expected if you like your bacon crispy."
1670,5,"My knives can once again cut through fruit and vegetables like butter. It was exceedingly easy to use, with obviously excellent results."
1671,5,"These Large cubes of Ice are the latest trend in the Trendy cocktail bars because of their super slow melting rate (less surface area) and their differing look. This is the best home version that produces some beautiful 2x2 Ice cubes. It can take a small amount of effort to get the cubes from the silicone material (maybe a little more than standard hard plastic trays -- you just stretch and push them out -- For these Trendy Large cubes it's actually good to carefully extract them out this way, you won't \\""crack\\"" them or risk fractures. Do it once and you'll be a PRO.<br /><br />The small problem I had with this initially (after a few uses these floaties are no longer a problem, should also throw it in the dishwasher before using it) was that the Awesome Ice Cubes produced white \\""floaties\\"" in the drink. I search about these floaties and it seems that this is a small problem that some people experience with silicone trays (again initially). Most likely the case is that there are minerals in the water that condense when frozen. It's just a theory. A SUPER Easy way to get rid of this is to do a super fast rinse of water and they are gone and the cubes are Georgeous.<br /><br />What I've also learned from searching on google is to use filtered water to increase the clearness of the ice cubes.  Also, if you use Hot water, and/or boiling filtered water you can get even clearer ice cubes due to the length of time it takes to freeze the water.<br /><br />What many people also don't think about is the tons of other uses this Silicone Tray can be used for.  Being a Silicone Tray, you can use it to Freeze Cubes of Food and save them for another day.<br /><br /> I have found that people have many uses included:<br />  Freezing and Storing Homemade Baby Food<br />  Freezing a bit of wine that you have left in the bottle for a future food recipe<br />  Homemade Soaps and even Homemade Candles<br />  People Freeze Coffee and/or Chocolate and stick it in their morning iced coffee soyou don't water it down<br />  JELLO SHOTS<br />  Freezing Hot Chocolate with Marshmallows on top of them<br /><br />Also, something I would have never thought of is to Freeze Water with some lavender or other essential oils.  Then you put a cube of this water and oil in your shower and you have a Soothing Hot Shower."
1672,4,"I like this frother better than my previous frother because of the propeller like head, which seems to help froth milk better, but the motor doesn't seem any stronger or faster. It is well built and doesn't seem like it will fall apart though."
1673,5,I love the simplicity of making tea with this &#34;teapot&#34; the screen filter is wonderful. It doesn't leave a puddle on the counter when you are finished filling your cup.
1674,5,"ADDED A FEW MORE SO WE CAN HAVE THEM CLEAN ALL DAY.  GREAT PRICE, WOULD RECCOMEN TO EVERYONE.  THE WHOLE SET IS GREAT"
1675,5,"Love having a template! It's great having the different sizes! There is a group of men that do a man's breakfast in May, and fried pies are made the Saturday before."
1676,1,I ordered this for a mine craft cake. It says its 1in x 1in and it wasn't. I kept it because my last name starts with V and the product has a V indentation.
1677,5,"I love this product. I didn't use the cheap pen, either, but the hold is great. I place my glasses in the large part and a letter opener in the other part. Neat product!"
1678,2,I was looking forward to utilizing a fun timer to help motivate my kids to get ready for bed.  The bell quit working on the second use.
1679,4,"I was intrigued when I saw a stainless steel straw set for sale. My family makes smoothies every day and we go through a lot of plastic straws. We used so many plastic straws that it just seemed wasteful to toss them out everyday after one use. So, when I saw these straws I decided to try them. I am happy to report that my husband and I have adjusted well to these straws and we continue to use these stainless steel straws instead of our old disposable plastic straws. These straws get really cold when you put them in an icy smoothie and it tastes extra cold as you suck it though this straw. After we drink our smoothie, when we are finished using them, we use the included cleaner to clean them with warm soapy water.<br /><br />You should note that obviously, as they are stainless steel, these straws do not bend. And be careful to pay attention as you lower your mouth to drink from this straw as you can bump your teeth on it if you aren't paying attention. Also, though I appreciate that it comes with a cleaner for the straws, it really is just like a pipe cleaner. It will do the trick but you may have to replace it with a sturdier bristled cleaner down the road. We use bristle brush cleaner that came in a set to clean baby bottles and it works fine for us.  These straws are a great value if you want to rid yourself of disposable, flimsy plastic straws."
1680,3,I purchased this item and it looks genuinely like a shampoo and conditioner bottle.  It will be used on a cruise this July.
1681,5,"I enjoy cast iron cooking. I enjoy Lodge products. After years with an old cheap wok, I deceided to give the Lodge a try.<br /><br />It stayed put, it held the heat, and cleaned easier than any other Lodge product I've ever used first time out.<br /><br />Now we stir fry at least once each week."
1682,3,"Cast Iron Pudgie Pie units, are VERY HEAVY... almost TOO HEAVY for the thin RODS that hold them into fire. 1 Pudgie Pie apparatus<br />had to be repaired, as the PIN holding the CAST IRON top of unit, was missing, making half the Unit fall off. Had to get a SCREW that fit the hole to keep unit together.<br /><br />Work well, and are great for Family time, as we can make different styles, including the great Apple Pie filled Pudgie pies, rolled in cinnamon sugar!! Cheese Pudgies are always great hit for Kids!!"
1683,5,"Product worked like I expected.  Tried vanilla first and it was creamy, even after being in freezer for days later.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a home ice cream maker.  Easy to use and a breeze to clean."
1684,4,"good product, well made, nice for extras to have on hand...i bought three.  of course, with plastics and stuff, these items are over priced, but they do definitely do the job"
1685,1,"this pitcher pours wide and messy.  the liquids come out around the whole front half of the lid, and they are not channelled into a tidy flow.  unfortunately, this means that the pitcher is unusable.<br /><br />not recommended"
1686,5,This was bought as a gift.  My son likes it and that makes me like it!  I like that it is solid white without patterns because it makes it easier to get completely clean.
1687,5,"Fantastic rich livid and surrounding sound. Do not look further, close to Bose quality for half the price and German stubborn attitude to do things well. I can not be happier with my purchase."
1688,5,I gave away all of my Tupperware when I found Rubbermaid Premier and some of it was brand new.  Premier is so durable and versatile (can put in microwave and bottom of dishwasher).  It comes in many sizes and stacks so perfectly for storage.  It seals perfectly and you can see the contents easily.  The lids snap together for non-slip storage in your cabinet.  My son uses this size for making his big salads and taking it with him for lunch.
1689,1,"Since I am alone now I thought I would get a smaller coffee maker.  I read most of the reviews on this one and decided it was worth a try, but after using it only four times it is in the garbage.  It is a nice size and does make coffee, those are the only good things I can say.  The pause and serve, which is a feature I looked for, leaked every time I used it.  If you decide you want to make a second pot, condensation runs off the lid when you open the top and down the outside to make a puddle on the countertop, this can be avoided if you want to wait 8 hours for it to evaporate, also the lid opening on the carafe is very small, making it hard to clean.  I would not recommend this coffee maker and will stick with my 12 cup Black and Decker which I am very happy with."
1690,5,Love them.  Love them. Love them. Love them. Nice and thick plastic.Shiny sheen.  Very good product. Very pleased. A winner.
1691,4,It's a shame that I have had to replace the pitcher for my Mr. Coffee Tea maker at least twice.  Hope this one will last longer than the others.
1692,1,"The rubber part on the lid smells very bad, and I tried to cook food, and my food tasted rubber."
1693,1,These cups are not good for HOT beverages .as soon as put hot water in it CRACKED. It is not mentioned in description so be CAREFUL!!
1694,5,"This cooker does exactly what I want it to.  I was put off by the price at first but all the other positive reviews convinced me to ignore that and now, after a year of use, I'm glad I did.  Here are the useful points of my experience I feel I should share.  First, I do not follow the instructions regarding water volume because the results were not good.  I live near sea level and have some of the softest water in the country (Portland) so I had to adjust for ideal results and you will too.  Here is what works.  I always cook only one portion, 140 grams, 500 calories (approx.), one clear measuring cup full - this is the minimum you can prepare but its all I need.  I have no doubt that if I scaled up the portion I would get the same excellent result.  I do not use the water lines in the cooking pot, instead I use the same clear measuring cup (included) for water after I have measured the rice.  The best ratios for my unique altitude and water quality are: White Rice = 1 water to 1 rice;  Brown Rice = 1.5 water to 1 rice;  Wild Rice = 1.75 water to 1 rice.  You may wish to increase water slightly for Sushi and Risotto rice but this requires some experimenting.  Remember, more water means longer cooking time and softer, stickier rice.  Also, not avoidable, always rinse your rice first or the results will be sticky bad; rinse until the water runs clear.  Cooking times for this volume are consistently 40 minutes for White Rice and 80 minutes for Brown Rice settings.  And when cleaning this thing afterword I never use soap and I never scratch the pot.  Just rinse with hot water and wipe it clean.  The apparatus in the lid must also be pulled apart and wiped dry but it only takes a few seconds and is nothing to complain about.  I should also add the I frequently prepare the purple heirloom variety known as Forbidden Rice and it is uses the same setting and volume as White Rice.  I normally do not write reviews but I can't deny that this product was money well spent."
1695,5,"This is a good prodeuct.  My son had purchased one and I used it, then had to get one for my own kitchen."
1696,5,"8\\"" diameter with approximately 1/16 inch openings in the mesh. We have a couple of fine and very fine mesh strainers, but needed one with a more coarse screen. This has a nice size... smaller than any colander (both in overall size and in opening size), but larger than most strainers. Useful for liquids as well as when I am grinding salt for the table. The wood handle is also well made and well finished, but I would NOT put it in the dishwasher. Hand wash only in my opinion."
1697,5,The vacuum vain easy stack is great! Sure saves room in the fridge. Great color. Going to order more as Xmas stuffers.
1698,5,"I just love it.  Mom bought me a cheap one when I was single.  It broke several years ago.  Had it on my Christmas list several times, so I bought on this time just like mom's...She's had her's since I was a kid some 40 years ago.  I do love it...IT is so good for chopping up Hamburger for stuff like Chili."
1699,5,"Great substitute for powerful blenders.  Have only used it to make fruit smoothies.  It handles apples, berries and other fruits efficiently and quickly.  Purchased for rental property as substitute for powerful blender but will take it home for making hearty soups and other small mixing jobs.  Very powerful and seems to be well constructed."
1700,4,"We use this daily. It worked perfectly first few months, and still does. But the motor can get too hot and smells like burnt plastic. Also makes coffee taste like burnt plastic. We have to clean it out thoroughly before use to get rid of the smell, and use very lightly to prevent overheating. Good for the price, but I'd probably get a different one next time."
1701,5,This has many functions and it works as it claims. Makes for not a nightmare transporting your cooked items. Very sturdy.
1702,4,I use it to heat left-over tea. It's just the right size and does the job well. And of course it should last forever.
1703,2,I bought these because they are listed as being paper. They are NOT!<br />I will not purchase them again and find this annoying!
1704,5,What a concept to have a kitchen gadget that makes a perfect blended dressing while looking totally cool on your serving table.  The Zyliss Shake 'n Pour Salad Shake is super slick with measurement markings on the bottle eliminating the need to dirty additional tools and the pendulum that blends the dressing is ingenious.  No more buying ready made dressings when you can create healthful options with this amazing shaker.  P.S. I love anything made by Zyliss!
1705,5,These are ok for cheap rice paddles. I guess I shouldn't compare them to my Zojirushi rice paddle but they do what they were designed for. Serving rice....
1706,3,Most big ballons have a decent size tab that you can use to tie the string on.  This one has a tiny tab - I got 4 balloons and 2 of the 4 tabs ripped off.  I had to tie the string around the balloon - it worked - but looked a little weird.  The balloon was cute and color is exactly as pictured.
1707,1,"I had read other reviews and it seemed everyone mostly complained about noise(duh its shaving ice, noise will happen. So I ordered the machine anyways....big mistake! It broke after the 5th use. The part that spins the ice against the blade gave out, stripped, whatever and we had to send it back for a refund. Not the machine to purchase it your kids want to make slushies and snow cones this summer!!!"
1708,5,"This is my third electric wine opener, so I have enough history with these gadgets to spot a good one. This unit is quieter, faster, and more reliable than any I have used. My wife and I sometimes open 3-4 bottles of wine each night, and even more when we have guests (just kidding!). But we do usually open one per night, and so far this unit hasn't had a single problem with traditional or plastic corks. The clear housing in the extraction section is useful to monitor the progress (or lack thereof). So I don't think it is likely that we will chew up a cork with this unit. This model does cost a bit more than others, but in the overall scheme it's a negligible extra cost. If you value quality tools, then spend a few more dollars and get this one."
1709,5,"This is a capacious, well made dish in a bright, lively color that goes beautifully in my kitchen. This is THE must-have family-size baking dish for my household!"
1710,5,"I looked at a lot of containers at stores and found that they were 6, 7 ,8 and $9 each for various sizes.  these containers came in a set for a very reasonable cost,  perfectly packed, no chips or missing lids and do what they are supposed to do.  Store food well.  The sizes seem pretty convenient , and they came quickly.  I have not microwaved in them yet or frozen them, but they do caution you not to put a hot container directly on the counter or on a wet towel or surface, and not to go directly from the freezer to the microwave.  These seem like useful instructions to prevent breakage.  When i heat them, i will be putting them on a dry towel , a dry stove mitt, or a trivet."
1711,5,These are great!  I wish they would make them in at least two different sizes.  These are MUCH cheaper than the boxes at the grocery store with only FOUR bags in them.
1712,3,"I have been a little disappointed in the quality of the blade, it's a bit flimsy.  But for the price, not a bad purchase."
1713,5,"I've had travel mugs by this same manufacturer previsoualy, and the design was not as effective as these mugs. (The other ones I had had plastic on the mug itself that could not go into the dishwasher.)<br /><br />These are spill-proof, and I'm unclear as to why some reviews have said they are not.  I drink a lot of tea, so these mugs are perfect for shaking -once fully closed- to mix the hot tea with the honey.  I assume it would work the same way with anything you want to mix in the container (maybe coffee with creamer or the powdered flavors you can add to water).  It keeps everything hot for a couple hours and cold for closer to 6 hours.  Since the lid can go in the dishwasher and the mug is only non-porous metal, I suspect these will last for a very long time."
1714,3,"I find this pan very hard to cook in - I bought it to cook eggs in and find that I need to use more butter to cook my eggs.  They stick easily if the entire pan is not thoroughly coated.  the pan doesn't come with a lid, so that's kind of a drag.  I bought silicone pot holders because the pan handle gets very hot.  The outside has chipped already and I haven't had it but a month.  I didn't want to cook with teflon any longer which is why I bought this pan, but I make due with it - it is great for cooking other items in, just not so good on the eggs."
1715,5,I can now have a delicious cup of my everyday Folgers coffee from the canister! No more expensive K cups. I love my Keurig machine that was given to me as an anniversary gift from my husband! This item made it so much better. Love it.
1716,5,Exactly what I needed. Use it for gift-giving as well since so many of my friends are in need of a product like this. Delivery was prompt. Definitely is worth of a 5 star rating.
1717,5,They came very quickly and were all intact. My daughter plans on decoupaging the bottoms and selling them at craft fairs. A great bargain! Will definitely order again!
1718,5,"I have been dieting for a while and needed a fast, easy way to make popcorn without the oil or butter.<br /><br />This is even simpler than using my air popper. You just pour the popcorn in, place the lid on top and put everything into the microwave. My microwave is small and rather weak so it takes 2 1/2 to 3 minutes set on high.<br /><br />Just listen for the pops to slow way down and take it out. With a little experimentation, I can get almost 100% popped and no burned kernels or popcorn.<br /><br />My air popper machine tended to dry out the popcorn too much and this way it is a bit moister. If you don't use oil (I don't), clean up is basically a quick rinse and wipe - less than a minute. I am very happy pleased with it."
1719,5,I was amazed on how easy it is to clean. Works great when cooking on high heat and not a lot of oil is needed.
1720,4,Was everything i wanted. I got when i was suppose to. Just hate that it is bu usps cause i gotta go pick up my packages now. :(
1721,2,"I bought this rice cooker for my mother, and after an hour of trying to get it to cook a cup of rice, my mom had already finished eating the cup she steamed on the stove (old school)."
1722,5,I am very pleased with this purchase. I wanted a red cover to fit in with the decor of a newly remodeled kitchen as the mixer itself no longer was the right color.  The cover is a true red color.  It fits fine and seems to be of quality construction. It fits my requirements and was a good prce as well.
1723,5,"I actually bought this item as  a gift for a family member, but I have had one for years and love it.<br />I only use it for frying [ does a great job]  I like that it has a basket and a thermostat. I would purchase<br />one again"
1724,5,We eat baked potatoes all the time and they are always so hard or time consuming to prepare. This product really makes it easy as pie! I highly recommend!!
1725,5,"I actually have an entire set of these pots and pans from cuisinart, and they have faithuflly cooked and unstuck many-a-messes. This pan also cooks very evenly. I purchased this because I had accidentally left my electric burner on while eating and this poor pan fried. The non-stick is just gone...i recommend never cooking on high heat with these pans if you want the non-stick to last forever. But even without the non-stick, they are nice pans regardless (maybe just don't cook eggs). And they are teflon free!! This very important for when cooking on high heat, as the teflon actually adheres to your food above certain temps...and you eat it...gross and unhealthy."
1726,5,If you use the tamper tool with out lid in place.....the blade will damage it! Oops......this replacement tamper tool is exact to original one that came with the Vitamix.
1727,5,"Who doesn't love a spatula so you can get the last of everything out? Fact is, my daughter took them home with her and she uses them almost every cooking day!"
1728,5,Very useful for single coffee user. It is my second - I had to order it online because could't find in stores.
1729,3,"they are a lot bigger than i expected which i guess i should have figured but i can deal with that, the main thing was the glass on the outside is pretty thin and i guess i'm just scared to put it down to violently"
1730,4,"Works well on slightly green fruit, which is how I like it anyway. This does not work very well on softer ripe fruit it will just mash it."
1731,4,I like this. It is not quite as loud as I'd like but then it's not this company's fault that as I get older I'm losing more of my hearing. At least that's what my family tells me. It does the job in notifying me and that's what I wanted.
1732,5,"[[VIDEOID:moRVS4S9XWHYA2]]I love coffee. My wife does not. I was happy with a large grinder I purchased recently to pair with my new french press.  My wife was not.<br /><br />The Kyocera grinder got spousal approval because it is small. Other nice perks are that it does not require electricity and it has a top to seal the fresh grinds in the container as you run out the door.<br /><br />I purchased it in May 2013. The quality gives me the impression the grinder will hold up a while and the blades will remain sharp.  The video shows how the grinder is easy to assemble and simple to use. I plan for it to support only my coffee habits and it is a great fit so far.<br /><br />UPDATE: Over a year has passed and the grinder is still working like a charm. I've started to experiment with other styles of coffee at home (drip and air pressure instead) and the manual adjustment on this device allows that to happen.  I love being able to adjust the coarseness as needed. BTW, a co-worker recommended the grinder to me (and since he owned a coffee shop, I take that as pretty good credibility)."
1733,2,"This is the second set of Trudeau mugs I have purchased.  The first set was about 2 years ago, and I paid $19.00 each.<br /><br />-  Cup appears identical to the original style, quality is NOTHING like the original.  Weight of stainless steel seems to be a different, lighter gauge.  The tops are difficult to handle when opening reservoir for drinking.  As stated in other reviews, the handle has a coating that starts to peel on handling out of the box (reminiscent of peeling sunburned skin....lovely thought while enjoying a cup of Joe).  I guess the adage is, you get what you pay for.<br /><br />Not so disappointed as to return the item but will definitely continue using the older cup until it gives out completely."
1734,5,Really love this pastry blender.  Comfortable handle and works well. The style of this blender allows for more contact with the bottom of the container making it easier to blend. Good size. I have small hands but it isn't too big for me. Would work well for a man to use as well.
1735,5,"Took this to Germany for a week. Our hotel didn't offer in-room coffee, and breakfast didn't come with the room. So I searched on Amazon, read reviews, and settled on this hot pot. It worked wonderfully. It's very easy to switch from 120v to 240v--you just upend it and use a screwdriver to move a pointer from one to the other. The auto-shutoff worked just fine. We used it to heat hot water for instant coffee, tea bags, and oatmeal.<br /><br />Used it with this plug:<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YN01X4/ref=oh_details_o09_s01_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br />and had no problems whatsoever.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product, and would get it again."
1736,1,"Was sent this one by error, only in white.  It is totally no good in my opinion.  It's way too stiff and thick and won't bend at all to get into curves of pans and pots, missing the whole purpose.  If you are using it to only scrape a flat cookie sheet, say, then it might not be too bad.  The pair of very thin, square Nylon Pot Scrapers from Harold's Kitchen here on Amazon is what you want - I've used them for years and years. Love them - perfect for removing the fine oil debris and gunk in a pot or pan without getting it all over your sponge or cloth AND for scraping off any heavy-duty residue, such as burned-on stuff.  No, I'm not shilling for them; just know my stuff!"
1737,5,"My wide body thermos that I had for a long time got broken so I started looking for a new one. Well it took me a while I couldn't find any close to me, so I went to Amazon and as usual I was able to purchase two. Now I will be able to give one to my wife, she's always borrowing mine.<br />Thank you"
1738,5,"So I've used a few different versions of these, most of with crush my knuckles. It doesn't hurt per say, but its more annoying. This ergonomic design is great! Easy to use, blades are good and sharp, slices apples easily and makes cake-work out of slicing apples."
1739,5,"I love this cup! Perfect size to fit in your cupholder. The best part is that your coffee or tea won't taste like stainless steel or plastic. Easy to clean and the built in cozy protects your hand. The best part is that your beverage will stay hot for a long time! Surprising for ceramic, but true! Worth every penny!"
1740,5,I enjoy my coffee from this cute 4-cup coffee maker. It smells and tastes just like good coffee you bought from a local coffee shop. I wish it has a longer extension cord though.
1741,4,I really like the whistling kettle. I have purchased whistling tea kettles in the past that did not whistle loud enough.  This whistle is loud enough.<br /><br />I did have one minor problem.  The plastic tab on the whistle - stopper melted when I was heating water on my gas stove.  It is now shorter and not in the ho air rising from the burner so it should no longer be a problem.  I would suggest the whistle be made with a plastic with a higher melting point.  Then it would get a five.
1742,1,"I bought this Item to store my Cats soft  canned cat food in and I received it on Tuesday April 30 2013, I  was not able to start using it Until Wednesday May 1 2013  because my Cat had to have surgery so she was not able to eat until then. I had no trouble with it Until this Morning May 5, 2013, after I feed my Cat I put the Glass storage Container back in the refrigerator and I no more than shut the door and the Container Literally Exploded, There was Glass and Cat food all over the inside of my refrigerator. (and no the cat food was not hot or even warm I had just taken it out of the can). Thank God My cat was not eating out of it when it Exploded or I still had it in my hand.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IT IS DANGEROUS, If you do, you are buying at your own risk."
1743,4,a little small.. but still does the work.. others in store were over priced. so this works better. thanks thanks
1744,5,"Have used this item for years; common in Europe.  Very sturdy.  Large size.  Unfortunately, I've managed to break a few.  Great price and service."
1745,2,"I have a white sink and it always looked discolored or more than that, it looked like it needed to be cleaned.  Not a problem, I chose another one that was white."
1746,5,"My daughter has a chow chow themed room, so we purchased this. It is rather small, but still well made and pretty funny."
1747,5,"I didn't think that any coffee pot could compare to the Braun.  After many years of use it finally went kaput..I did lots of research before investing in another pot.  This pot makes good coffee. The tempurature selection is an awesome feature, it is easy to program and works!!<br /><br />Still miss the Braun, but I'm starting to love this one..."
1748,4,"Although small in size, this juicer really has power!  (I had to make sure to keep my hand over the opening, because as I added produce to the chute, some of it came 'spinning out', which was a little messy at first!)  Otherwise, it is wonderful."
1749,5,I love this product.  I'm sure there are better ones on the market but the price was right!  The plate does get hot which is a great thing because it keeps my coffee at a perfect temperature!  I definitely recommend it!
1750,4,It's dimensions were described accurately on Amazon's website. I use it daily.<br />Keeps food and drinks cool with the use of a freezer pack.
1751,3,"I was pleased with this s. s. kettle until the weld on the spout that held the whistle part on just fell off therefore rendering this \\""whistling kettle\\"" obsolete.  I bought it is just 5 months ago.  I don't know if there is a warranty on it, but wow I thought it would last longer than 5 months."
1752,5,Love this product. It's the perfect measuring device when making waffles in my waffle maker. It takes just about 4 scoops for a perfect waffle.
1753,5,"These are a great size for bakers, a little larger than normal cooling racks and the hatchwork is very helpful when removing the baked good from the rack. Cookies don't seem to stick as much"
1754,4,I was looking for patriotic items for a party. It was nice to find something besides streamers. It seems of good quality and is the perfect touch to dress up my table.
1755,5,I have had nothing but hand me downs all my life and finally had to break down and buy me some new ones because the ones I had really took some engineering to operate them.  But I decided to go with Emeril first because of his reputation and I have watched some of his shows.  I am not a fancy cook.  I cook your everyday meals but I have fallen in love with these pots and pans.<br /><br />The only thing that I wasn't real happy about was that they are not dishwaher safe but then I got over that real quick when I realized how easy they are to clean compared to my old ones.<br /><br />I would recommend this product to anyone.
1756,5,"I make all the food for my baby, peeling apples by hand was killing me. This peeler is a life saver! You can choose to either just peel or peel, core and spiral slice. It does it all in seconds-it's pretty amazing. I was pretty skeptical before I tried it, but it works great. It says it will do potatoes, I don't eat them so I can't comment. I did try a sweet potato, it does not work very well at all on them-they are softer and odd shaped usually. The apples come out in a thin spiral cut-my 3 year old thinks that is cool and loves to help me when I'm peeling. Cleaning has been easy so far-I get any little chuncks out and wash off in hot water then air dry-I wouldn't run it through the dishwasher<br />One tip-I stick the peeler to a large plate so I dont have apple peels and juice all over my counter."
1757,4,"I bought this for the purpose of a cookie jar, however, its entirely too small to fit any cookies. you're better off using it for sugar or salt. Its cute nonetheless."
1758,3,This bottle is nice to look at but not so great in use. It's difficult to clean and a funnel is necessary to fill the bottle.
1759,5,"It has done beautifully with everything I've put in it except cucumbers.  I think cucumbers are to watery/soft inside.  I have had so much fun.  Beets, Jicama, Sweet potatoes it's just so much fun.  The salads I've made are beautiful."
1760,5,"So far the cooker has been performing to my expectations. I've never owned a slow cooker before, and I'm just so happy with it now!! It's made my life easier!! The cooker is super easy to use, looks great when it's on the counter, it's so easy to clean, and the size it's just right to be able to cook for our family and have leftovers!"
1761,4,Pros:<br />-Price<br />-Easy to use<br />-Re-usable filter<br />-Quick<br />-Small<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Feels a bit cheap<br />-Water seeps into the mug during washing; hard to get rid of the water inside of the frame of the mug
1762,5,"Like the average home owner who owns a microwave, I've used mostly what's on clearance or sale at Walmart or Target as the microwave is not a big deal to me as say my toaster oven which I use more on a daily basis and requires quality performance. We recently did a kitchen remodel so I had to buy a new microwave so this time I thought I did a little research and buy the best rated models.<br /><br />It came down this SS Panasonic unit with it's inverter tech that supposedly cooks things more evenly and quickly. Oh btw one of the reasons why I avoid the expensive units is because all they do is offer more power in watts but what that means is that it cooks your food super hot and quick but then it's not even which bugged the heck out of me. I did NOT like that type of quick cooking, it zapped my frozen burritos to mush, so that's why I stuck with the lower watts units around 600/700 watts.<br /><br />Well This inverter unit from Panasonic is simply and easily the best microwave I've used and will ever need. It cooks my food so much more evenly than any models I've used in the past and it does it quicker than the others with out sacrificing the integrity of the food. It is also super easy to use with it's 1-touch buttons and the dial is also very nice but I used the 1-button cook for just about everything I put in there. The door is really nice and dampening, it doesn't wake up the whole dang house hold like the other cheap units when you close the door. This is a very, very nice microwave for under $100 from of course the Amazing Amazon price and selection. I love this unit and Amazon."
1763,4,My wife just started baking a year ago and once in a while I help her decorating the cake.  One time I suggested to her that she should get a revolving cake stand to make it easier (actually for me 'cause i get tire walking around our small work table to put the icing.  At first she just wanted to get a cheap plastic turntable but after looking around local stores and reading from the internet I decided to buy her this Ateco 613.  She was so delighted when she saw it first and was so please when started using it.
1764,4,Only complaint is they are handle heavy and you must be careful how you<br />place them on the burner.  Very nice heat distribution and release properties.<br />I love the small one for omelette's and crepes.
1765,5,This is a great product. I bought it for my self but so many people saw it and wanted it so i had to buy like 5 additional ones.<br />I have it for 5 five years now and still works perfectly
1766,3,"If you are interested in avoiding BPA (a chemical in hard plastics that can leach out into food)than do not use this product.  Especially if you are making and freezing your homemade baby food in it.  I emailed the company asking if they use BPA in the product and they wrote back: \\""The silicone is BPA free but the plastic is not as it's not a heated product\\"".  I purchased these trays to make my own baby food am returning it to the store unopened and unused.<br /><br />However, I gave the ice cube tray 3 stars because the company, Mastrad, was great about quickly responding to my question.  If you don't care about BPA in your plastic food products than you might like these trays."
1767,1,Followed directions but it warped within the first month which makes it useless for cooking.  Size is great too bad quality isn't there.  Avoid this pan.
1768,5,"I'm an avid baker, lots of cheesecakes! I have probably 7 springform pans in different sizes, high end companies & a couple cheaper brands. I have to admit, this is the first one than not only baked superbly, it also cleaned up like a breeze. In a couple of mine, the crust of the cakes frequently &#34;cakes&#34; up in that groove where the disc meets the wrap around part. Not with this one. I just ran hot water around that groove and the solids just popped right out. They wash well in the dishwasher and like I said, bake phenomenally. I think the positives may be due to the shiny material. Looks like I will be replacing my other 7 going forward."
1769,4,"This grinder does a very good job of grinding enough coffee for a cup or two, which is the most I usually make at one time. It is difficult, however, to hold it steady, owing to its small size. I find that the best way is to sit with it gripped between my thighs. Still, it's a lot of grinding--70 or so turns of the handle--for a single cup's worth. That said, the grinder is fully adjustable and it grinds very clean."
1770,5,I use these for all my kitchen needs.  A must have for any kitchen.  Excellent for the price as well!
1771,5,"You know how when you're in Paris, and you know you shouldn't give in to the urge to buy that little Eiffel Tower trinket, but you just can't help yourself, you unabashedly crave a souvenir, so you just go for it?<br />Well, here's a useful way to remind yourself of your glorious trip to France- an Eiffel Tower-shaped cork holder to store your French wine corks!<br />It's good looking, and big, too, holds a lot of corks. Or you can put twinkle lights inside it and dress it up like the real thing.<br />It's metal and sturdy and looks pretty close to what it's supposed to.<br />And if you buy it, then you will have to buy a lot of good, French wine to fill it up!"
1772,5,"Like other reviews have said, it is a little small. But it works very well and feels very solid. It does exactly what it is supposed to do and it does it well."
1773,5,Perfect size for smaller casseroles in a 2-person home.  Easy to cook in and clean-up is a breeze.  We use this in our toaster oven on the lowest rack.
1774,5,"It takes a while to work with this ice shaver. Now that I know that, cannot say I would buy it again."
1775,4,Love the look and feel of this peppermill and salt shaker.  The pepper grinds just perfectly - even had compliments on it from guests!<br /><br />My only issue with the set is that there was a sticker covering the salt shaker holes and it left a gummy residue on the top of the shaker.
1776,5,"Like my product, am happy to have found what I want.  Was not happy with the delivery.....some of them were wrapped up in a circular package and needed to be flattened to use.  But will use the avenue again, if needed."
1777,4,"Nice replacement for the original probes which seem to die way too early.  Have tried other probes, but they all proved to be very inaccurate compared to this item."
1778,4,"We've had these for a couple months now.  They are definitely nonstick and are easily cleaned in the dishwasher.  They are lightweight, but so far have been durable enough for regular use (~2 times per week), and show no signs of wear to the nonstick coating."
1779,5,Nothing fancy but these work fine and are less likely to break than the hard plastic type. Simple is good.
1780,4,This is a cute cup...I bought it for travel. The lids fits very tight so spill proof. It is smaller than I hoped it would be.
1781,3,"I bought this for my son who works on a reality show about bikers! He pointed out it's a scooter, not a bike! It served its purpose as a prop for the pizza party, but the pizzas come pre-sliced, don't they? Not the smartest purchase I've ever made!"
1782,1,"I am on my second one of these the handle is in the wrong place needs to be higher up, They break at the top of the handle, be gentle when using, hold the bottom do not put all your trust in the handle."
1783,3,I got it for my and it works well enough but it is just a tad too short so it can sometimes overflow and grounds will float out over the sides and into the pot.
1784,5,"The original scale I ordered wouldn't zero out.  I would turn the scale on, and the number on the scale would immediately start to rise.  The same thing would happen when I used the tare function.  I wrote a three-star review after using the original scale, and the manufacturer contacted me shortly thereafter to offer to replace the scale.  The new scale worked much better, and I was very impressed with TFY's customer service."
1785,5,"I bought these as a complement to our space and doctor who themed birthday party for our three year old son. He didn't really understand the concept of 3D, but his older guests certainly did. The kids definitely had fun wearing the glasses and many of them took them (as well as some napkins) home as souvenirs. It was bit pricey for my tastes, but the product was definitely good quality."
1786,3,"The bottom half of these two-part, disposable wine glasses all too frequently fall to the floor, leaving your party guests with upper-half glasses they can no longer put down on flat surfaces. When a guest reaches down to retrieve the bottom half of his/her glass, the wine they have left in their glass can spill, more easily, because of the awkward way one must hold a wine glass with no stem. (I had bought enough disposable wine glasses for two parties, so at the second party, I scotch- taped all the glasses at the mid-stem joint between the upper & lower halves & had better results.)<br />These glasses are the cheapest alternative to the problems attendant to a roomful of guests with actual wine glasses that must be washed & can break, so I'll probably keep purchasing them & use plenty of scotch tape!"
1787,5,if you are a fan of community the tv show  this mug is the bomb  cooooool  rad groovy far out
1788,5,"These coasters are great!  They are light-weight, but also strong and durable.  They are concave on both sides, so they collect moisture either way.  Your glass won't stick to them because they have grooves.  Highly recommended!"
1789,5,I used this for a baby shower cake the blocks turned out better than expected. The mold is very sturdy.
1790,3,the board is plastic and  the plastic isn't very hard.  when I use  the board  I get deep  slices  into the plastic.  Now I have a board with a lot of slice marks  deep in the plastic.  it also slides on the table when I am cutting some things.
1791,5,"So beautiful, and practically non-stick!  I plan on buying a lot more of this stuff in the future.  I'm replacing all my Los Corelle with Le Creuset."
1792,5,ive used 3 different kinds of sanitizers and i feel that san star is by far the easiest and the best
1793,5,Pasta holder holds pasta.  It has successfully held all the pasta I have put in it so far.  I have not yet seen it fail to hold pasta.  The snap closures snap closed with a light touch.  I like it.  Buy one.
1794,4,"The cutlery holder is very nice.  For the money spent, they make a nice presentation! I would buy these again as gifts."
1795,4,"I had tried the standing desk fad before, but it always made my feet and legs hurt like the dickens. After getting this, it was much more tolerable. I ended up draping a towel over it since standing in bare feet made it kinda stick, and when I shifted around, if I didn't have the towel, I got cold feet.<br /><br />When mine was unrolled, it stayed arched for a bit, and then flattened out after a little while. It didn't have any wrinkles as some have reported.<br />Mine also didn't produce any offensive odors or off-gassing that I could smell.<br /><br />The only downside I've found is that if I stand in the same spot for a while, my feet sink to the floor. I naturally shift around quite a lot as I stand, so this isn't really a huge issue. I feel like if I had a double-thick version my feet/legs/back would be in heaven."
1796,5,THIS SPOON REST IS VERY NICE AND I LIKE THAT IT IS BIG ENOUGH TO HOLD UTENSILS...I WOULD RECOMMEND IT
1797,5,"My dd loves it. It's bright and fits nicely in her backpack without being bulky, Use a plasic sandwhich container though cause you don't want her food squished. The velcro closure at the top is a great feature so nothing falls out."
1798,5,i would buy again . way stoked  it feels heavy and the handle feels good and the food easy to cook on it.
1799,5,Nice quality items from Cuisinart. I have been very happy with all three sizes. Nice and sturdy and the fine mesh is very handy...
1800,4,"Takes up much less shelf space than Pyrex pitchers since it has straight sides. Great for heating liquids in the microwave, since the handle doesn't get hot. Perfect for making several cups of tea. Plastic cover for storing in the refrigerator.<br />Only drawback is you cannot mix hot liquids and ice quikly, as it can crack.<br />I've used mine for years and have given many for gifts and it is always appreciated. When gift giving, fill with goodies or decorations."
1801,5,I purchased this scale to replace another that I had that quit working.  This scale seems to be a bit quicker and it  even has mL which my old one did not.  It works as great as I had hoped it would.  I use the tare function with almost every use; it is very handy.  I am very happy with this purchase.
1802,5,"I bought this refurbished pot and really enjoy using it. It always makes a perfect cup of coffee, tells me when I need to clean and I can replace the filter every 2 months to keep the coffee consistently good. I use the 4 hour shut of every day and it is one of the great features of this pot. I NEVER have to worry about missing the pot when I pour water in the pot.<br />I roast my own coffee and it makes every cup delicious."
1803,5,"Works great, peace of mind knowing impact resistant glass so it is safe for having in the table with my kids.  We did not have any difficulty with the cap as other reviewers mentioned.  Easy to open and close."
1804,5,I use it to grind up chicken breast for dog food. I burned up a mid priced processor and looke at this one and the top of the Cuisnart one. The other was way to heavy for me. I put 5 or 6 breast in at a time - No problem as it does not even slow down. I would highly recomend this any one who wants a great processor which should last for a lifetime.
1805,5,"I had given a similar bicycle-themed mug from Clay in Motion to my sister for Christmas & my daughter went wild for it, but did not like the 'bicycle man.' I found this mug on Amazon & shipped it to my daughter in Illinois & she LOVES it!"
1806,4,"These are decent molds, I have a hard time finding anything autism related in stores. I wish that they were a little thicker so they would have a longer life through use. I haven't actually used them yet, but seem good for the price."
1807,4,"its a 4 in one grinder. i bought this specifically for 'alternative' herb. that being said ive also used this in the kitchen. a bit small for some kitchen jobs, but it will prove itself. top layer (shark teeth) is magnetic so grinding is easier. second layer is the sifter. third is the catcher and the bottom is for powders and anything that is too small to stay top layer. Worth it. still a bit small but awesome"
1808,5,"This grill is perfect for just the two of us.  Size is just right for a small meal, and grilling indside is geat."
1809,5,This fits better and works better than the one I bought before. I will be using it more often. Its great!!
1810,5,"I was very delighted to receive my bake set and get the quality I expected..  I am extremely happy with the product and the price was an extra bonus.  Goodbye Tupperware, hello versatile bake ware, ovenware and storage ware.."
1811,5,"I love this coffee pot. I have it set right next to my kitchen sink and I can fill it with the sprayer without having to pour water into it. It dispenses coffee very cleanly with no mess or drips and fills small and rather large travel mugs with ease. I alreay have two of them, one for work and one for home and I just bought this one before they quit making it if one of my others should quit working. This is perfection and they will probably screw it up when they decide to make &#34;improvements&#34; and update it so I got this just in case. I love this coffee pot!"
1812,4,"These are the cutest napkins ever.  I'm a big owl person, so they caught my eye immediately.  Using them with my daughter's baby shower cake will be perfect.  I was most pleased with quick delivery. If you're a procrastinator like me, ordering late, this works out perfectly."
1813,5,"I've had this item for nearly two years. It's terrific paired with the Foodsaver. You can store a wide variety of things and reduce waste and cost. It's environmentally friendlier than the plastic baggies FoodSaver sells, and more cost effective. The mason jars this pairs with have lasted in reuse right along with this item. Some of my favorite uses. Lettuce and herbs. They only last a couple days in the fridge unless it goes into the FoodSaver. Then Boom, it's fresh for 2 weeks or more. Pricey cheeses and salami's stay fresh for weeks and weeks in the fridge. Great on dry stuff that can lose flavor exposed to air like nuts, Parmesan cheese, dry fruits, coffee etc. This is not one of those items you buy that goes into a closet and doesn't see the light of day. I use it daily."
1814,1,"...the dimensions on the package are way off.  It's just too big to fit a standard toaster oven!  In addition, it is poorly made."
1815,4,"I purchased this kit as a gift. It arrived fast. Have not put this product to use yet; however, all pieces that are listed did come in the kit. Look forward to getting the Kegerator set up!"
1816,5,"We have made ice cubes, chocolates, jello jigglers.  My kids think anything shaped like a lego is more fun. They are nice a durable."
1817,5,"I just needed some corks for some old, antique glass bottles I have.  The corks are not brand new but some look as good as new and all of them are in quite good condition.  These work great and they smell so good too.....wine!  Can't have enough spare corks in the house you know."
1818,4,It is what it says it is. We have only used one so far but it seems fine. Price was good.
1819,5,"The only improvement would be to request that the buzzer go off and then be quiet.  I admit it's loud, but once I start my poached eggs, I go back and finish dressing in the morning and can hear it very well at the other end of the house.  Poached eggs are perfect every time.  Love it!!!"
1820,5,"I love this mug. It is great for tea,water,coffee or anything. I love that you can draw anything on it. My sisters love to draw on it."
1821,5,Amazing product. Well made and I already knocked two meals on it and my first time cooking in a DO. The meals came out excellent. My first LODGE and certainly won't be my last. Don't think twice about getting the LODGE brand. It may cost a bit more but way worth it. I'm now convinced since I was torn between Camp Chef and Lodge. Glad I made the right choice plus the lifetime warranty and MADE IN USA sealed the deal.
1822,5,"This is my second juicer, my first one being a Juiceman Jr.  I have started juicing higher volumes and wasnt happy with the amount of prep and chopping I had to do for the Juiceman. Upon reciept of the Breville I was surprised by its quality construction and weight. My first juicing with it was surprising because it is much more powerful than I am use to. I barely have to use the plunger on some softer fruits and there hasn't been any fruit or vegetable that it cant juice well for me. I also have no unjuiced chunks as I am use to with my other juicer.  It is so powerful that some items want to pop out the feed chute but I have adjusted and keep one hand over the opening until I have enough fruits or veggies in so that they cant move around until I can get the plunger in.  I love this juicer and will buy it again should something happen to this one."
1823,4,"Coming from the point of view of someone who can barely making PB&J without starting a fire, these are a great, budget-friendly addition to your kitchen utensils.  They feel surprisingly sturdy and clean also easily, but take careful note of the &#34;hand wash only&#34; part of the description.  I missed this at first and machine washed them, and while they're still usable, their texture is now much coarser and clings to sauces more readily.  Still, they were well worth the investment."
1824,5,Bought it for my daughter in Florida.  I have been using mine for 10 years and still is in great condition
1825,5,I have a set of these in another brand. But these are better. They are sturdier and the wooden handles are of better quality.
1826,5,Easy to clean. Great price. Simple instructions. Arrived at promised time and in great condition. Would recommend to someone that is interested in a homemade yogurt that stays at a consistent temperature.
1827,4,"This acrylic pitcher is just what I wanted for a tea pitcher and it works great.  However with the lid on it still leaks a little down the front when pouring into a glass, just enough to be a nuisance."
1828,1,"This was the most amazing pan I had ever used, for about 9 months.  Then suddenly everything stuck to it.  Even oil stuck to it!  What a disappointment.  The ceramic coating is so thin, it wears off, even if you take great care not to overheat.  Don't buy it."
1829,4,"I wanted something that fit in with a Coca-Cola themed room and was a compact size. This fits the bill just right and yes, it keeps the drinks cold. Now if I could just find an old-fashioned Coca-Cola bottle openeer for the wall....."
1830,2,I have owned a Tupperware can opener for many years and it still works great.  So I decided to buy my daughter one when her OXO brand started to fail.  I was so disappointed when she told me this new model Tupperware can opener was worse than the old OXO!  It is dull and does not cut through the can.  I am returning it for a refund.
1831,5,"I have wanted a lazy susan for a long time.  Most everything I had seen online was really expensive, and not exactly what I had been looking for.  Then I actually found it at Costco, and for a great price! But I ended up giving it to a friend as a gift, and when I went back to get myself another one, they were all gone.  I was so bummed.  I saw it on Amazon, but it was unavailable at the time, so I had pretty much given up.  After a couple of months, Amazon notified me that it was in stock, and even though it was more expensive than at Costco, I bought it immediately.  I haven't had a chance to use it yet, but I know I'm going to enjoy it; it's just perfect."
1832,5,the Anti-Fatigue mats were purchased to use in front of my sewing table. They work great and have helped my feet and legs feel less tired at the end of the day
1833,4,Looking for something of this type for a while. I does stop the pot from overboiling but you have to be carful when removing. The hot water stays on top and can spill onto your fingers. Care is needed but it works as expected in preventing spillage on your stove.
1834,5,I remembered this item from my childhood. I used to use it to chop nuts when gramma was baking. This one is just like it and works well.<br />I am not at all happy with having to write so many words for my reviews and that I cannot submit my rating without word count!
1835,3,I love my shaekology cup but the &#34;shakeology&#34; print is already rubbed 1/2 way off :( I will probably just order the shaker from beach body next time.
1836,5,"It does lift the Keurig up too high if you want it under your cabinet, but I have plenty of counterspace, so it was not a problem for me.  Nice and sturdy, drawer is smooth and holds plenty of k-cups.  Love it!"
1837,5,Very easy to use; worked perfectly; delicious results; a little powdered sugar and some maple syrup makes a wonderful breakfast!
1838,2,Decided to buy the cookbook in addition to the chip maker.  None of the recipes in it are ones that I will use.  Waste of money.
1839,5,"I have offically finished my collection of comfort grip cookie cutters (so far) =)<br />Good quality, and great selection! I love love love my set!"
1840,4,"When they say mini! They mean mini.. Like the pot is barley deep enough to boil water. It is probable about if not smaller -around- than, a saucer, and the handle for the pot top was loose it comes loose easily but, just spin it and it'll tighten. The griddle is the biggest thing. Still small but, a good amount bigger than a slice of bread around and deep. The sauce pan had some defects, like the little tab was bendable it had a few scraps down to the aluminum on the side. The spatula was small but, good enough.  In size biggest to smallest it goes griddle, skillet, pot, pot top, sauce pan.  I like mini stuff and it's cute. It can kinda be used for serious cooking but, not huge servings. The griddle is probable what I will use most."
1841,5,"I owned a lipper rolltop in the past and that was very large, but the rolltop broke in less than a year. I got this to replace it. It is a bit smaller but still large enough for my needs and seems like it will last more than my old bread box."
1842,1,"The design of the Black & Decker CO85 is a step backward from the nearly identical Spacemaker design of a dozen years ago. The main problem is that the device needs to be mounted about 1/2\\"" below the cabinet in order to be able to remove the blade for cleaning (as is intended). The earlier design could be mounted flush with the bottom of the cabinet. They do provide unsightly plastic extensions for mounting, but their use could have been avoided. Also, the more angular design and metallic accent do not look as nice as the earlier rounded, all white design. Unfortunately, it seems to be the only under-cabinet opener on the market."
1843,5,I was amazed that Le Crueset Stoneware had these adorable Salt and Pepper Shakers.  These are perfect for my Le Creuset Caribbean collection!
1844,5,I use these charger on special occasion. They are really nice and they do not tarnish.<br />I have the whole set and I enjoy using them with different plates.
1845,5,"As soon as I first used the OXO Good Grips Nylon Flexible Pie Server I knew it was a keeper. I have several OXO spatulas but I needed one with a pointed tip because, when serving cake, I often did not get the tip of the slice on my spatula or cake server. I have fancy pie/cake servers which are pretty but too thick or not flexible enough. The OXO immediately became my favorite. This pie server has a perfectly angled point and is thin and flexible enough to get under my most delicate cakes. It has ridges around the triangular piece which are very helpful for separating slices or cutting slices. It has a cushioned handle and feels good in my hand. I think the size is perfect for me. The triangular head is 2 3/4 inches wide, at it's widest point, by 4 1/2 long. The length, including the handle, is 11 inches. It is very easy to clean either by hand or in the dishwasher. I try to use it for more than just cake because I like it so much. It is great for serving pizza or meatloaf slices. If this ever breaks, and I don't see how that could happen, I will replace it immediately. I wouldn't want to be without it."
1846,5,"I searched healthy non-stick wok for a while and finally decided to buy this one because it meets all my requirements and has many positive reviews. Now I really like this wok. Non-stick makes cooking much easier and enjoyable. I use it every day for cooking breakfast and dinner. Either cooking for the whole family, or just for one person, I always feel this wok is the right size because the bottom is small and the entire capacity is big. The flat bottom is just the right size for a one-egg omelet. It's big enough for me to cook stir-fried vegetables for my family of four."
1847,5,"I drink a lot of coffee & tea.  I love to have a quick cup of coffee brewed via a \\""pour over\\"" method.  I have boiled water in a pan for quite some time to accommodate for my coffee/tea.  I looked at many different kettles for a while before finally purchasing this one.  I AM COMPLETELY SATISFIED.<br /><br />I love the fact that it is entirely stainless steel.  NO PLASTIC/CHEMICAL smell at all.<br />Some have complained that it is loud.  Really?  Most are because they are boiling water internally.  That just seems a bit 'knit-picky' to me.  It is not overly loud.  It does make noise, but if you grind coffee beans, that makes a lot of noise as well.<br /><br />The beauty is the quickness & auto-shutoff.  Unlike boiling water in a pan (& I've let the water boil down to nothing & it about ruined the pan & stove), this I can turn on & WALK AWAY... & if I get pre-occupied with something, the water STAYS HOT for some time!!!<br /><br />I recently boiled 3.5 cups in this pot & boiled 3.5 cups in a pot on the stove for a comparison.  The Aroma pot clicked off at 4:26 where the pot on the stove took 10:06 to come to a rapid boil.  PRETTY GOOD!!!<br /><br />Buy this, you won't regret it... plus it looks GREAT"
1848,5,Perfect for cooking for large groups and can store in airtight container until needed again for the next cooking session
1849,5,"Didn't expect this to toast well, as it is inexpensive, plastic, and lightweight.  But due to the reviews, we gave it a try.  It works better and faster than toasters I have bought for multiples of the price.  The fact that there is no cancel button is really insignificant.  There's a dial that performs the same function.  The only &#34;criticism&#34; we have is that it is so lightweight it sometimes tips forward if you press the lever down with too much force.  Be gentle with this toaster and it will reward you with good toast quickly."
1850,5,Coffee pot works great. This coffee pot is very easy to program with it's automatic turn on. Great way to wake up smelling fresh coffee.
1851,5,"My wife and I love cooking with (sans the cover) and storing food in this pyrex product!  No issues with the seller or packaging, everything went smoothly.  Heartily recommend."
1852,4,"I'd never used these before, but read a positive blog review/suggestion about them and decided to give them a try. I like them, but occasionally they come unfastened. I bought them to keep a little mesh bag closed in the washing machine (filled with soap nuts) and once in a while they come unclipped--hence the 4 star rating. Usually they work fine."
1853,5,I had one and it was lost in our move.  I looked in all our stores in town and couldn't find one.  I like it because it doesn't take up a lot of space.
1854,5,"I never know what to get my wife for Valentines Day.  I saw this on sale locally the other day and bingo - my dilemma was solved.  The major things you'll notice about this are (1) it is stunningly beautiful, a real work of art - the pictures just don't do it justice; and (2) wow, it is heavy.<br /><br />My wife has several Waterford pieces and treasures them all.  We don't drink wine or champagne so this will be used as a small bowl in our house. She was thrilled with it.<br /><br />I highly recommend this if you like Waterford's high quality and great design."
1855,4,"I've seen these large ice balls before, they work great to chill but not dilute a drink. The molds are high quality, but dont fill them up too much or they will squirt all over you. One tip to get super clear ice is to boil your water first and then pour into the mold."
1856,5,I got for my soups it works great!! I would forget to take the leaves out now they are out in one shot !!
1857,4,"I have been using this popper with the 4oz packets for two years now, every day. Two of the switches have failed and I bought replacements on the Internet having the same specs. Why 4 stars? Because it makes the best popcorn. Everyone who has had it raves about it. Our postman even times his route by it. To make the popcorn really crispy, I open the glass doors all the way back and attach a screen over the opening with small magnets to allow better venting. Many have said it is better than &#34;theater&#34; popcorn. Don't know why it was not designed with screen doors. Perhaps there is a danger from hot grease popping out although I have never had a problem. I would like to give it ten stars if the Chinese switches had been as good as the British replacements (GC Electronics Rockford, IL Part No. 35-688)."
1858,3,I love this oven. I use it almost daily.<br /><br />One thing to be wary of is the convection fan. Mine started making a rattling/grinding noise after a few months. I suggest you google BOV800XL FAN NOISE before deciding to purchase. This appears to be a common problem that may not show itself until after the warranty is over.
1859,5,These napkins and associated plates and towels are so very beautiful.  A lovely winter addition to my bridge table or informal gatherings.  I am buying more of them.
1860,1,We measured and these glasses do not hold 4 and 1/4 oz! They barely hold 4oz. I would guess they hold 3.8 oz. I just got them today. I think I am going to return them.
1861,5,This pot rack holds about 7 to 8 pots with no problems. Looks very nice as well. I may purchase one for my daughter...
1862,5,I can make perfectly sized eggs for egg sandwiches.  you do have to be careful that you dont pour the eggs in too thick.(I use egg whites) it can take a while for the top to cook while the bottom is burning.
1863,5,It works as one would expect to decalcify a nespresso.  I followed the directions and used it and the machine works fine.
1864,5,"I have two of these little cow creamers. They are awesome and make me laugh everytime I use them. Great product, well packaged and shipped as promised."
1865,5,I purchased 10 of these pans for Christmas gifts.  Great reviews from all that was lucky enough to receive one.  I bake three lemon pound cakes at a time (mixed separately) but cook at the same time -- my old pound cake pan is 40 years of age.  I have searched and searched for a one piece and this pan is exceptional.  I am placing my order right now for nine more to give as wedding and birthday gifts.  Love the pan  5 star.
1866,4,"I recently received this as a gift. I have been using the KitchenAid, the old school, really sturdy one. So, this mixer had a lot to live up to.<br /><br />First, we made cookies. No problem at all. Batter was fully incorporated without scraping.<br /><br />Next, I freshly mill my own wheat for bread. I made 4lbs of dough using the hard red wheat (for you mill-ers out there), the CuisinArt didn't hesitate to knead it perfectly. The dough did not creep above the shied on the dough hook. (Which happened with the KitchenAid when making 4 lbs of dough). I did have to scrape the sides with the large amount of dough in the beginning, but once the dough was together, I didn't have to scrape the sides. The head bounced slightly with dough, but the mixer didn't move at all.<br /><br />My only dislike, it's loud. Much louder than my other mixer, however it is more powerful, so logically it's going to be louder.<br /><br />4 stars because I don't know how many years I'll get out of this wonderful machine.<br /><br />Certainly worth the price. Comparable to the KitchenAid."
1867,5,"We needed a larger spice rack to hold our spices and this one fit the bill as it was a few inches wider that most others.  Easy to install, too.  Just be sure to measure properly.<br /><br />Two things to look out for:  1)  If your cabinet door has cutouts on the front so that some areas are more shallow than others, you will want to be careful not to screw through the front of the cabinet.  After you measure the screw and the depth of the area that it will go into and determine that it will pop through, use a nylon washer under the screw to pull the screw back a little.  2)  With the shelf and spices in place, you may find that your door will not close because the shelves in your cabinet are in the way.  If this is the case, you may need to cut your shelves back by maybe 1.5&#34; and may need to reposition the shelf pegs deeper into the box to support them.<br /><br />I had to do both of the above.  It was a little extra work, but it came out great and we gained a bunch of space by moving the spices to the door."
1868,5,I bought this tap handle as a gift and the recipient loved it. It is hand painted and all of the details are there. The green has a shiny gloss coat.
1869,5,GREAT TOPPER. MY HUSBAND WAS VERY SUPRISED AND LOVED IT. I TOOK THE VEIL OFF THE BRIDE AND CHANGED HER HAIR COLOR TO BLACK TO MATCH MINE. IT WAS SUCH A HIT AT OUR WEDDING THAT SOMEONE ACTUALLY STOLE THE TOPPER AND THE CATERING HALL REPLACED IT FOR ME WITH A NEW ONE. I WAS HAPPY WITH HOW FAST THIS SHIPPED AND VERY HAPPY THAT I WAS ABLE TO GET ANOTHER ONE... I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS TOPPER TO ANY BRIDE OR GROOM.
1870,5,"Nice and colorful, works well for many things, so far a great pan.  We will be ordering at least 2 more in larger sizes to replace our calphalon pans, that are wearing out."
1871,5,Just what I ordered. Made a great gift for my daughter in her first apartment. I would buy them again.
1872,5,"My daughters fiancee had these years ago and recently told me he had broken or someone did, all except one.  His birthday is in February and I was very excited to find these.  Shipping was great and everything."
1873,4,"Very helpful for my mother who needs a bent straw to drink from.  The hard plastic ones - do not bend, the soft plastic ones are easily chewed and then hard to drink from.  The down side was the length for the glasses we have (our problem, not the straws) and I would like to be able to bend the straws as needed.  For endurance and for ease these are wonderful."
1874,5,"I have been cooking with cast iron for about the last 5 years and I think that it made me a better cook.<br />All my cast iron cookware is Lodge. I have the 12\\"" skillet with lid, the 8\\"" skillet, the 10 1/4 \\"" round grill pan, the 14\\"" pizza pan, the 5 quart  Dutch Oven, the rectangle grill press, and now the reversible grill/griddle.<br />I would give all of them a 5 star rating, the food taste is great, it is easy to cook with, and easy to clean.<br />I think that the grill/griddle is the right size for a single or two people on the griddle side, so a family of four might want two."
1875,2,This device fulfilled both the desire of our children for slurpees without the trek to 7-11 and the parental need for the occasional margarita. We had to return our first one which claimed it had been tested before shipping. It had electrical problems and would not have operated if actually tested so that was a blatant falsehood. We returned it for a second one that works just fine. We hope to get our money's worth but won't be surprised at more problems in the future.
1876,1,I've had two other Black & Decker ovens and they worked great and lasted a long time.  I bought this one recently and it is not the same quality I am use to from B&D.  Have to find my glasses to see how to set all the dials just to toast my bread.  I cook biscuits often and in my old ovens they baked quickly.  It takes a long time to bake in this one.  The price was fine but the quality is not in this product.
1877,5,"Excellent.  Can't beat the sturdy stainless steel construction and being insulated as well, it keeps the coffee nice and warm.  Easy to clean and nothing to break!  This will provide a lifetime of great french press coffee."
1878,4,"good potato masher.  I can't really comment on this because (believe it or not) I bought it to keep in my rubber stamping room to tie bows with, so I am not using it for it's intended purpose, and there's nothing strenuous about tying bows.  :)"
1879,5,I received my Big Mouth Juice  I'm very happy so far I like it very much today is the second day  I have is great is worth the money vey good :)
1880,5,Arrived quickly.  Very pleased with this seller.  Highly recommend.  No worries here.  I love shopping on Amazon because it's an easy way to shop.
1881,5,My son love it.  Great gift.  Him and his dad made espresso almost every day he was home for the holdays.  Thanks so much
1882,5,"I like this product a lot, it is perfect for drinks you specifically do not want watered down even a little bit. I enjoy using these often.<br /><br />I do however believe they posses a drastically smaller amount of cooling power than similarly sized ice cubes, but that is not really their intention. They is a reason why they are called whiskey rocks and not reusable ice cubes."
1883,4,"Okay I like how the tongs slide into the green plastic block, versatile, unfortunately one of the slots in my set was a little on the \\""loose\\"" side, thus one would constantly fall out.<br /><br />It is just held in with friction, there is no snap or locking system.  For a Six dollar item I just super glued in one of the tongs into the loose slot.<br /><br />This is the perfect utensil for wooden bowls, very visually appealing."
1884,5,"Love this set. I filled it with salt and set it next to my stove/oven. I use it for marinating and sooking. The top is easy to flip open, the spoon is also handy and the whole thing is easy to clean."
1885,5,"I love this little guy!!  It works great, I love the feel of the handle, it's just the right size and it's not flimsy, it's decent quality, I believe this will last me quite some time.  Great deal for the price paid, I wouldn't buy any other."
1886,5,Just what I hoped for at a great price.  Not all Cuisinart products turn out to be as good as one anticipates from the brand name; this one does.
1887,5,These muffin tins are great if you want to make large muffins.  I use them to make bran muffins for breakfast & I think they are a great size for a meal.
1888,5,I have used this same cup for the past 4 yrs and LOVE it.  My old was looking rough.  I couldn't find one anywhere until now.  I received the cups super fast and in perfect condition.
1889,3,the decanter itself is very pretty and well made but the stopper does not fit very snug. this really isn't a huge problem but for those who don't use the product placed in it very quickly the loose stopper does not keep the air out and the liquor can become stale.
1890,3,"it was a little pricey for being pieces of cardboard, but if you are going for a good at home bar look its perfect,it was exactly what i needed. its 25 pub cardboard coasters"
1891,5,I am obsessed with this. I cook meal in this everyday.<br /><br />I just love it. Its best for two to three people and good for those who never used crock pot
1892,5,This works like a charm!  Great price too I thought.  Bought one for a gift and decided to get myself one as well for that price.
1893,5,I bought two of these.  One for myself and one for my daughter.  My farm fresh eggs sit wonderfully in them.
1894,1,I purchased this to hold extra large eggs and the cups in the egg tray were so large that the eggs fit closer to sideways than straight up and down. Much larger cups than an egg carton. Would work well perhaps for turkey eggs.
1895,1,Utensils are to small for any adult to use. Also the top broke as soon as it came out of the pkg. very poorly made. You will end up giving this to your 3year old daughter so she can play with her dolls at tea time.
1896,5,I like this for storing flour on the counter top. Nice quality and design. I wish I had bought one more.
1897,3,"Scratched up my kitchen aid & would not mix, way too large very disappointed. Thought info was misleading. I threw it out."
1898,1,This dispenser was awful!  It jammed and didn't pump out any soap even when I watered it down!  I returned it!
1899,3,"It works well enough ...for now.  It's made of cheap plastic with a slip on handle, which I don't see holding up under alot of use."
1900,4,"This kettle may not heat up as fast as the more expensive models, but you only have to wait a couple of minutes longer. Very lightweight with an auto shutoff."
1901,5,I bought this Christmas gift for someone who has everything.  I thought it was a classic style bowl that could be brought in and out of her cupboards for years to come.  The only thing is that is seemed smaller to me in person.  I double checked the measurements and they are accurate so it was only my own perception.
1902,5,"After reading other reviews of the 2-part style of shield, I knew I didn't want that one.  However, this one-piece style works well, serves its purpose, is easy to add and remove, and is simple to clean."
1903,5,"The zirconium blade, when broken into slivers works perfectly as a lighting element in a Nernst lamp. I have no idea how it would work as a peeler."
1904,5,"Very happy. The wine rack is just like I wanted-vintage wise. The metal is rusty brown color and the grapes on the side are pretty and bright colored. Sturdy and holds all wine bottles perfectly.  Make sure and measure where you want to put it, if under a cabinet, only thing I messed up on, It's too tall for my counter top. oh well, now to find a cute corner stand to set it on."
1905,5,"I have several of these decorative bakers.  The pumpkin patch pan like the others bakes evenly.  After cooling, the bread releases easily.  The decoration is detailed and very cute.  I used the Libby pumpkin bread recipe.  It is enough for two loaves.  I used the gingerbread kid pan for the other half of the mixture.  Fill the pans just about halfway each.  The ingrediants rise almost to the top, and the bread is really yummy.  I added chopped pecans and chocolate chips.  Makes baking even more fun."
1906,5,Makes a great cup of coffee in the morning and my tea throughout the day.  So convenient and the perfect temperature.
1907,1,"Don't be attracted to or fooled by the Ginsu name. Their quality has clearly diminished through the years. I've had to replace these so-called stainless steel knives on several occasions because, right out of the dishwasher, they rust immediately and eventually break. I've been foolish to invest in replacements to keep the set together - but no more. To clean them, I have had to either wash them by hand, cutting myself in the process, or scrub the rust with a stainless steel scrub ball - just as dangerous. I thought stainless steel meant exactly that. Not so here. I do not use these knives on a daily or regular basis and I've still had no luck with their advertised quality claim. There is obviously a blend of metals used in the manufacturing process that Ginsu insists is a stainless steel blade. This blade is seated in a polymer (plastic) handle which sooner than later begins to erode and chip in the dishwasher, causing the knives to fall apart one by one. I've truly had it with Ginsu."
1908,2,"I bought this for my wife after trying to convince her that it was typical infomercial junk.  She insisted otherwise, so I caved and ordered.  She has since grown frustrated after trying to make basic smoothies, and has stopped using it after only 2 weeks.<br /><br />The containers are perhaps too narrow, so nothing circulates and unless you blend very small amounts of liquids it does not work at all. the blades just spin and nothing gets mixed/blended."
1909,5,"Great food processor, as advertised. I bought it for a gift and it works wonderfully!  It is the right size for most home kitchen cooks.  11-cup size was recommended from a popular T.V. chef."
1910,5,It does exactly what I need and It also excedes my expectations. I can slice everything the exact thickness I need.
1911,5,The Zojirushi makes great rice. It's like having take-out in your own kitchen. Very easy to use. It's worth the price.
1912,4,Came intact and as pictured in a giftable box. Not a huge mug but not too small. My RN sister was pleased!
1913,5,"So, I've ordered several of these.  Different brands, different types and it seems like the ones I've received in the past have always been broken.  Well, luckily I ordered two this time.  Different brands.  This one came and it wasn't broken.  The color is nice and the wire is tight and useable.  The reason I gave this one a full five stars is because it comes with replacement wires in the instance that the one already on the device gets broken during shipping, which I assume happens a lot based upon the reviews on several of these cheese boards.  So it's nice to know that even if it did come broken that you could fix it up and use it that same day."
1914,5,"They are very lightyweight, they keep the heat out when used and I strongly recommend these pot holders to everyone."
1915,5,"Nice quality. I was having a hard time find a sharpening stone for my husband in the stores, so I was glad I could find it online."
1916,5,"got this in time for xmas gift for my mother in law, she had already gotten 1 from friends at work, but did say that she was going to keep this one since it was better made.<br />thank you<br />Randy"
1917,4,"So far, no issues with this salt mill, other than some of my family members haven't figured out how to use it properly!  The design seems to be confusing to some people more used to traditional mills, but I haven't had a single problem.  No mess, grinds nicely and uniformly.  Overall a really good product for the price!"
1918,4,"Does what it needs to do.  Good balance in the hand and easy to clean.  I had a hard time finding this item in retail stores, so was glad to find it online!  So many of my favorite recipes call for zest, and this item makes that am easy task."
1919,4,My wife used these molds to make chocolate covered pretzel rods for her sister's baby shower.<br /><br />She layered the different colored chocolate to give the giraffe color and painted additional detail on later with candy paint.<br /><br />They turned out really well at a fraction of the cost if purchased from a professional candy maker.<br /><br />We would recommend these to anyone with a similar project.
1920,5,"These key covers are so bright and colorful!  I couldn't be happier with them.  They are a must have.  Just get them, you'll love 'em."
1921,4,"In the 3 days we have had this appliance, we have not been able to test all of it's features, but so far we are satisfied with the results.<br /><br />Scott Gordon"
1922,5,I purchased this as a gift and have not heard any complaints.  Prevents caps from being on the floor where pets or small children may find them.
1923,2,"I bought this because it was a recommended product from a magazine but I have no clue why it was recommended.  It has a button to make the coffee stronger but I don't taste any difference in the coffee when I use it.  You have to swing the spigot over the coffee grinds before closing the top and I've never had a coffee pot that made you do that.  Also, the basket for the coffee is too small and I can't make a full pot of coffee because it doesn't hold enough grinds.  That's also in part because the spigot gets in the way of putting more grinds in the basket.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone and wish I hadn't bought it."
1924,3,"I got a pair of these (one for me, one for a christmas gift for someone else) and mine was defective out of the box, sadly. Part of the design was scraped, right where the Tardis is so it's pretty noticeable. Shipping things back at this price just isn't worth it, so I'll suck it up. Luckily, the one I gave as a gift is fine, for now. You can tell the design will eventually chip away- when the mug is hot the paint does feel a bit gummy so it can likely be easily scraped off. Otherwise- really awesome. I'm just gonna be super careful with mine."
1925,3,I'm sure it will do the trick of cooling down your wort.  Just kinda crappy construction thats all.  I already have the same thing from Northern Brewer which seems to have better construction.  Bought this for a friend because he needed one and I was sick of borrowing mine to him so made a good christmas present.
1926,4,"In the picture it looks like a tote, but its actually very small. like purse-sized. I should've read the dimensions I guess. But other than that its pretty and sturdy."
1927,4,"I love the dishes. The colors and patterns are perfect for me and the colors in my house.  I recently purchased this second set because I liked the first set so much. One star off because the pattern does not match the previous set and they do chip. I am guessing that the color variation is because they are hand painted, so I'm ok with it, but those who are a little more particular about having things match exactly should make sure to purchase exactly what they need the first time (and maybe a few extras to replace broken ones), or they may be a little disappointed if they have to purchase replacements down the road."
1928,5,"Perfect design, lovely to look at and just stunning!!!  Gave one to a daughter and one to a step daughter and both were thrilled!!"
1929,5,"easy to use, durable, i love it and why am i required to write alot of stuff just to post this"
1930,5,Works as advertised.<br />Perfectly shaped ice<br />Ice doesn't break apart when removing from tray like my skull and crossbones tray
1931,5,"Great quality, as expected, from Kitchenaid.  Bought my daughter as she needed as an extra for hardcore baking of cakes for decorating."
1932,4,"Cat's cute & item was shipped promptly. Purchased this as a Christmas gift for a dear friend. The first time she used it - just as she was showing everyone her cute wine stopper - the cat came off in her hand. The cat is glued to the top of the stopper &, considering that wine stoppers must be pulled out of bottles, it seems the mfr would have thought that thru and at least used a better glue. It was a waste of money, basically. It's a cute novelty item but not functional.<br /><br />Original Review shows above. I recently received a replacement wine stopper with letter of apology out of the blue.  This replacement was completely unsolicited.  Looks like merchant cares about their reviews and customer service. According to my friend the wine stopper is working very well and seems to be quite sturdy. Good to know!"
1933,4,"I have been using this coffee maker for a few weeks and wanted to respond to some of the negative comments. You have to pull on the cord to get it to come all of the way out of the unit. The people who are saying the cord is too short are probably not pulling on it hard enough.<br />I have not had it long enough to comment on whether or not it will leak, but mine has not leaked yet. The coffee is very good. I have a k-cup coffeemaker, but wanted to be able to make more than 1 cup at a time. I also wanted to be able to customize the brew. This unit has worked very well for me and makes very good coffee. It is easy to clean, easy to fill with water and easy to operate.<br /><br />UPDATE 12/30/12<br />I am baffled by the people who say don't buy this because it's too much work to clean it. Unless you're expecting Cuisinart to send someone to your house to do it for you, it's really not a big deal. The parts slip out easily, I rinse them & dry them off, and they go back in easily. It takes less than 2 minutes. Filling the unit with water is not a problem either. It's not difficult at all. I like to use bottled water, so it's really easy for me, but even when I fill it at the sink, it's not a problem.<br />My machine has not leaked yet, but I've only had it for a month so I can't comment on whether or not it will start leaking. I will update this after a few months."
1934,5,I am an art teacher and I use these for paint. They are so easy to use because they dispense paint from the bottom! Just lift and squeeze! No mess!
1935,1,"I would have given zero stars if I could. Bananas are completely misunderstood and slicing them is incredibly cruel, unless you're doing that little trick where you use a string and slice the banana while it's still in the peel. That's magic. Black scary magic but magic none the less.<br /><br />The real deal is you are all opening bananas the wrong way. Seriously google \\""right way to open a banana\\"". You'll learn that the little knobby thing you think is the top is actually the bottom.<br /><br />How do we know this? Monkeys do it this way.<br /><br />And monkeys have been eating bananas long before we were.<br /><br />And you know what monkeys never do with bananas? Slice them.<br /><br />So learn how to enjoy bananas the correct way and you'll never have to cruelly cut one up like it's some sort of apple or something."
1936,5,"Not that this knife needs another 5 star review, but it's a good chef's knife. I'm not a chef or anything, but I believe that you don't need huge knife sets -- just a good chef's knife and a good paring knife and you can cook the vast majority of things. This knife definitely fits the bill. It feels good in the hand, is very sturdy, and it's a good size for chopping and dicing. I've been using it for over a year now and I have had to sharpen one or two times since it gets so much use."
1937,5,"I recently purchased a Zojirushi Virtuoso Breadmaker, model BB-PAC20, to replace a 20 year old Breadman machine, that had stopped working. So far I've baked three different kinds of bread with the new Breadmaker and I'm very pleased with the results.<br /><br />The Zojirushi is a heavy duty machine; the bread pan walls are thicker and the motor, I believe, is stronger than my old Breadman machine. It will make bread with 100% whole wheat flour! Also it has a second heating element in the lid that my old machine did not have. It appears to be a high quality kitchen appliance. Also, I like the fact that the loaf it produces has a \\""normal\\"" loaf shape.<br /><br />Added March 8, 2013:<br /><br /> I'v now owned and used the Zojirushi Virtuoso Bread Maker BB-PAC20 for three months. It has exceeded my expectations. There is a joy in creating a really nice loaf of bread. This machine is capable of providing that joy.<br /><br /> My experience with the recipes listed in the bread machine's manual is that they are very reliable. I started with them. However, I also wanted to make a white bread, not listed in the manual, that included honey and eggs. So I used the \\""Basic White Bread\\"" recipe, from the manual, and substituted honey and eggs. I put the beaten eggs in measuring cup, add water to the total amount of liquid called for in the recipe and poured the liquid into the bread machine pan. I substituted honey for the granulated sugar. It was a great success.<br /><br /> When making home baked bread, I don't like a \\""puffy loaf\\"" - I prefer a  more condensed texture. To achieve this, I'v experimented with substituting all-purpose flour, with less gluten, for bread flour. The loaf is not quite as tall but the texture is the way I like it.<br /><br /> Also, I've been trying recipes from several bread machine cookbooks. My first attempts were with \\""The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook\\"" by Beth Hensperger. This excellent book was published long before the Zojirushi BB-PAC20 wasavailable, so her recipes could not have been tested with this machine. My experience is that her recipes need to be adjusted for this Zojirushi machine. They call for slightly too much liquid and I had to add some flour to make them produce a good loaf. I've also tried a few recipes from \\""Betty Crocker's Best Bread Machine Cookbook\\"". My initial impression is that they need very few adjustments to work well with this machine."
1938,5,"These are handsome and perfect. I would but them again, and they suited the containers to a tee.  Also, very reasonable!"
1939,5,"A great  kitchen tool for all those who love to bake. Liked the blue color, handles are sturdy will use this for a long time."
1940,5,It is exactly like the original and I do not know what else to say because it is just a replacement carafe.  Good service packaged very well and shipped on time.
1941,5,I first purchased one of these when my daughter was eight.  She quickly figured out that she could open any jar by herself that an adult could.  I developed arthritis in my hads a few years ago and this opener has been the only way that I could open any jars at all.  My opener is still holding up fine after about twenty-five years but I want one for my RV also.
1942,5,"Its what I expected. Good product, heats the water as it should. No complaints. $ different temperatures makes it quite versatile."
1943,5,"Everything about it is great. Toasts the bread properly, lets you know when it's done, looks good, dials are easy to use. I can't be bothered with programable stuff and this toaster makes it quick and easy to use."
1944,5,"The garlic press: the dumbest kitchen implement ever.<br />But this is the best one ever built.<br /><br />I use a knife to deal with garlic -- garlic presses don't make sense to me.<br />But a friend had one of these, and I fell in love with the mechanism.  Someday I'll come up with something else to crush with it... it's kind of like a micro potato ricer on amphetamines.  Super high leverage.<br /><br />Heavy, effective, rigid as an I-beam.<br />Instantly minces whole cloves skin-on with no issues and cleans up with a quick flick open and rinse.<br />Beautifully engineered.  Fabulous.  Utterly unnecessary."
1945,3,"The cavity was too shallow so the sucker stick was not covered with chocolate enough. It was OK, but will shop around to find a better one."
1946,3,Shipping was really fast.It's in Good Condition.Haven't used it yet.My husband ask if the handle is going to be hot ?Good Question.Looks alittle light for All-Clad.
1947,5,"I read a lot of reviews before deciding to purchase this product and when someone said &#34;Finally! An egg separator that works!&#34; that caught my attention. It is wonderful, well made, and does what it is designed for without taking forever to do it."
1948,5,I like that this is from a variety of wine bottles.  I like that they are various colors as well as recycled.
1949,5,These are basic cork coasters They are 1/4 inch thick by 4 1/4 inch wide. They will fit my largest mugs and even my soup and salad bowls. If you want to get crafty these would make a great basic cork round for any craft project.
1950,4,"These are excellent, top quality baking pans. Commercial quality with very good non-stick surface.<br /><br />The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because the actual outside (maximum) dimensions are exactly 11-3/4&#34; x 17-1/2&#34;, and NOT the official marked size of 11&#34; x 17&#34;. That's not necessarily a big deal unless you're trying to fit a couple of pans on the same rack at the same time. Then it matters.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the quality is so good they've become our main pans in the kitchen. Heavy duty, with a very good non-stick finish (they look and act just like dark anodized aluminum, even though they're made from steel). We've used them a number of times now and the finish is as good as new. We don't beat on them or use metal utensils, but we don't baby them either.<br /><br />The other thing I really like about these pans is they don't have some ridiculous 2&#34; wide lip on each end, taking up unnecessary space in the oven when you're trying to fit several items on the same rack. Each pan weighs exactly 2 lb.-12.5 oz., so that will give you an idea of the sturdiness."
1951,1,This opener worked for about 15 bottles after initial charge.  After that it opened fewer and fewer bottle with each charge.  The batteries used in this unot are just not strong enough.  DON'T waste you money on this try another.  We've had better luck with a Waring.
1952,5,"This is only good if you have the pressure cooker.  Without the ring, the cooker would not function.  Therefore, it is a necessity.  I absolutely love the pressure cookers and would not consider purchasing another brand."
1953,4,The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it takes a short while to heat up so the first piece of bread to toast takes a little longer.  Not a big deal on a weekend morning but it makes a bit of a difference in the morning rush to get to work.  It's excellent for cooking in and the quality of construction is great.
1954,5,I love these spatulas...they are just flexible enough to work perfectly to get those last bits of dough or batter out of the bowl.  Great purchase!
1955,3,"It's sturdy enough and easy clean up, but design is too simple? It doesn't have those little things to hold seeds, everything you squeeze out of Lemon goes into your cup/glass. After giving up on finding a &#34;Made in USA&#34; juicer, decided to go with an old school glass one, but I must just picked the one with higher rating without paying much attention (was so sick of looking for one!)-can't believe I paid almost $15, too. Maybe I'll just get used to it since I use this thing everyday..."
1956,5,"I love it, it fits perfectly. I am so happy with this product and I use my wok almost everyday."
1957,3,The implement bends at the handle juncture when used for anything very firm. The &#34;metal&#34; decoration at the handle juncture went white with several of the implements.<br />The good part: they are very attractive . . .
1958,5,"I have to say I'm very impressed with this!  It heats up super fast, doesn't take up a lot of counter space, and produces consistently good results.<br /><br />I've been using it a couple of times a day for the past couple of weeks, and so far, it has performed well.  I've toasted toast, bagels, and english muffins; baked biscuits, broiled chicken and pork chops, cooked single-serving frozen pizzas, baked a potato or two -- everything comes out great.<br /><br />Controls are easy to read and operation is simple. The pre-programmed functions all seem to perform accurately.<br /><br />I've been looking for a replacement for my larger aging Cuisinart -- this may just be it.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you're looking for a compact unit that performs a lot of functions.  Would make a great gift for new empty-nesters, students in their first apartments, singles who don't like to heat up the stove just to cook a single chicken breast, etc."
1959,5,I needed this to cut cake circles to put together to make a roller for a steam roller cake. It is sturdy and cut through frozen cake without bending or warping for a nice clean cut.
1960,5,I love everything RADA. I have not found one thing made by them that I haven't been completely satisfied with. This little knife sharpener is very compact and doesn't take up a lot of space. Will fit into any kitchen drawer.
1961,5,This kit is a must if you are just starting out canning.  Everything you need is here and it is all top quality.  Add the Ball Blue Book to it and you are ready to can!
1962,5,The best cookie sheet I have every owned. I would highly recommend these to anyone. Can't wait to bake Christmas cookies on these.
1963,5,"WE LOVE THSI MACHINE, IT WORKS GREAT FOR A POT OF COFFEE AND FOR MY HUSBAND TO GRAB JUST A MUG OF COFFEE."
1964,3,"It's OK. The cost is equivalent to the quality. It's good for general use, but not a commercial product. I like the metal carafe."
1965,4,"I just got this mug as a gift for a friend, and I love it. (So does he!) It seems well-made and sturdy, it doesn't look like the color is going to fade or anything. One potential problem I see, however, is the fact that it is square (as expected- it is the Tardis, after all), and I feel that this may make it harder to drink from. That's really not a huge deal, though, and it may not even make that big of a difference. Also, it doesn't appear that it will hold copious amounts of anything (it's not small, it's just unlike the Tardis in the fact that it's definitely NOT bigger on the inside). Anyways, it's a cute mug, and I would definitely recommend it. I'm considering getting another one for myself."
1966,5,"It really does what it says:  It keeps hot liquids HOT for 12 hours, more actually. Cold liquids with ice a full 24 hours. Just amazing. I've run the tests twice.  I poured in steamy hot water (not boiling, but perked-coffee hot). I tested it 8 hours later and it was still steaming when I removed the cap. 12 hours later, I did not notice any steam rising but taste-tested it and it was a perfect temp for sipping coffee without burning your lips.<br /><br />Cold liquids with ice cubes stay a full 24 hours. Impressive. This will be a good option on hot summer days when water bottles quickly get warm.<br /><br />This holds a full 2 measuring cups of liquid. It is a perfect size for one person, like me, as I usually drink 2 cups of coffee in the morning, and easily go through 2 cups of water throughout the day.<br /><br />One does have to remove the outer cup and unscrew the cap, but I don't mind that. It is worth it to me to have my beverage at the temp I want it, and it is a beautiful cranberry red. I love the color and the size, it is easy to hold. A good personal gift for yourself or any solo traveler you know. Highly recommended."
1967,5,"Listen, I'm notorious for leaving things on the stove and burning them. I even went as far to burn a tea pot to the stove one time, so I was leary of buying another tea pot. This tea pot is pretty, but would it stand the \\""Jessie Test\\"". As my reputation held I burned out all the water and this thing was not broken, no cracks-nothing. I was a little concerned with the handle being hot but it wasn't. So needless to say this is a beautiful tea pot that I can put my seal of approval on."
1968,1,The brand that was shipped was called Flagship TM 'as seen on TV' and the product looks very flimsy. The steel is thin and does not look t be stainless. My other MIU products are all made of heavy stainless steel. Don't buy this item if you are looking for quality.<br />I am returning it without having used it so I cannot speak for it's functionality but it looks like something bought at a dollar store.<br /><br />This is not the brand I wanted.
1969,5,"This is a great little scale that has a surprisingly high weight limit for how big it is -- when I showed it to my housemate, he was excited to weigh his bicycle parts on it!<br /><br />In any case, it does the job well and, for the price, you can't beat it."
1970,5,"I purchased this as a gift to myself and to save energy when cooking our weekly pizza.  Instead of heating up the oven for one pizza I've used this more than a dozen times since receiving it and its a GREAT product.  I usually cook a frozen pizza adding my extras such as pan fried onions, garlic, mushrooms, peppers or anything else we're in the mood for.<br />Its a great product and cooks evenly.<br /><br />The only thing I wish was that the top unit swung to the side so I could place the tray on the peg and then swing the top unit back in place.  Instead you have to feel around with your finger until you feel the peg and then lower the tray onto the unit.  Doing this can be difficult when you have a pizza LOADED with topping since while trying to find the peg the topping at times touches the upper unit.  Other than that I love it and that one issue is not enough for me to ever NOT buy another one or recommend this product."
1971,5,Works well with my blender. I needed  a new one my original broke . Fast delivery got us back on track so that we can make things easier.
1972,5,"My mother in law has trouble chewing, at meat prices $2.00 more a pound for tenderized meats is a bit much when available. I bought a cheaper one before this and it was a piece. This one is HD and works very well and easy to clean"
1973,4,"Using the special twist chargers,Mypressi makes a decent espresso shot using a mechanical procedure that is quite easy to master. The shot produced comes out only warm not hot, but if, like me you like your espresso drink hot, you can compensate with milk that's really hot. I use the unit at my job, and as far as I'm concerned it produces a better espresso drink than the cafe on my job site that claims to make espresso drinks. If you use good quality beans you do get a nice layer of crema."
1974,3,"-Delivered in the Original Nespresso box wrapped in thin clear plastic and therefore arrived damaged.  Should be double boxed especially for the cost.<br />-Aeroccino Milk Frother works great and is easy to clean.<br />-Biggest disappointment is that the beverages are not hot (more like luke warm) and doesn't improve with microwaving a empty cup as instructed by customer service. Shouldn't need to do this when the unit is so expensive. For example, Mr. Coffee Latte Maker is better in comparison for a hot beverage and cost only 79.99)<br />-Another major disappointment is that Nespresso doesn't make alot of Decaf Coffee-only three types but no flavor decaf.  What is one to do if you are medically stuck drinking decaf coffee and can't use anything other than the Nespresso Capsules?"
1975,1,I noticed that one of the box lid was very loose so its difficult to carry liquids or anything that spills as i am scared my food will spill all over. They should have taken care of these lids better. With only 4 containers that are useful i think this turned out to be costly purchase for me.
1976,4,"I've had this drainer for over a month. So far, there is no rust or any spots. Not extremely convenient, but seems to be a quality drainer."
1977,4,"This lazy susan is stylish, black marble like looks great on my oak table. Will order more for gifts in the future. Looks nice as base for a vase of flowers."
1978,5,"Although it took a little extra time to arrive, this set of glassware arrived in perfect condition, not a chip anywhere. The color is gorgeous, the shape, size and style are just perfect! I am so very thrilled with this set of glassware. Purple is my favorite color, and I was unable to find this color in glassware at any local stores. In fact, most local stores only seem to carry clear glassware nowadays. Not sure why they don't make colored glassware much anymore. Thanks to Libbey's, and Amazon's great prices and free shipping!"
1979,1,I was so excited about this product from Joseph Joseph because I love their garlic rocker which works so well. I own 2 of them and I have given it to other friends as gifts and they rave about it too. But this peeler doesn't even peel. The blades are not sharp and it was a total waste of money. I'll still look at and even possibly by Joseph Joseph products but don't waste your money on this one.
1980,5,".. that not only does it say it does NOT need oil to fry, but the surface ACTUALLY REPELS OIL, so the oil all goes to center area instead of spreading out.  I used this for my favorite Chicken in White Wine recipe (uses boneless, skinless breasts), which needs the olive oil to mix with the bouillon/sour cream sauce put near end.  However, I simply moved each floured piece quickly over center area to capture some of the oil, then tilted skillet a couple times during browning to distribute oil to all pieces.  Chicken not only browned beautifully, but after covered later, turned out really nice and tender.<br /><br />I previously had to cook this dish in two skillets and had to divide all ingredients, which was a pain.  I am so happy that I can now make this in 1 skillet and, so far, have been delighted with this one."
1981,5,I like the light color of the wood. It looks good in my kitchen. I have some knives that are the same brand as the knife block as well as a few other knives and they all fit well in the knife block.
1982,4,"At $25, I wasn't expecting this scale to be great, but the ratings were so good that I gave it a try. I've been using it for about two months now and only have two slight issues with it:<br />1) The buttons are very large, but they seem to only register pushes in an obvious way if you hit the outer edges of the button. Once I figured this out, I just always hit the outside of the buttons and it works much better.<br />2) There is a slight delay between when weight is added to the scale and when the display updates. I usually end up pausing for at least a second in-between adding items to the scale. Otherwise you'll go way over your target and have to remove items to get back to your goal weight.<br /><br />Other than those two slight annoyances, the scale works really well, especially for the price."
1983,5,"This pot is well made, I realy like the handles and the ventlated glass lid. The bottom is heavy tri- clad for even heat across the entire bottom.<br />a very good buy for my money"
1984,5,"This product is worth the extra money. It is very durable and high quality. I have canned stew and chili in this canner, and have had great results"
1985,5,"This is a simple tool, but it works well. Much better than anything else I used before to mix bread dough. Recommended."
1986,5,I bought this glass to use with my homemade vanilla.<br />The cork lid fit well and the glass it's thick and perfect for what I need.<br />I love it~!
1987,4,The pans came so quickly and they are just whet I was expecting. I love these pans. The size allows me to bake many cookies at one time. They are sturdy and easy to handle.
1988,1,"This item is useless. First, all steaks, chops etc., come out very tough in relation to any other method of cooking. Second, it takes forever to clean it. You have to scrub it hard to get it clean, which is difficult to do considering the plates do not come off. After several attempts to get it to cook something other than hamburgers, we just threw it in the garbage. I'll never buy another - of any size."
1989,5,I've been going crazy trying to find a utensil crock for my son's new house. The theme of his kitchen is Italian and chefs. This was an abolutely wonderful find :)
1990,5,"The waffles are thin, but we loved them. They cook very quickly a lot faster than our old waffle maker. We used Trader Joes pumpkin pancake and waffle mix with some chocolate chips! Delicious!  For people who love the thick hotel style waffles, this is not the waffle maker for you.  While we love this machine and will keep it, we will replace our belgian waffle maker too for family members who prefer the thick style!"
1991,5,I have dishes that say Toscana and have a Tuscan scene painted on them. The accessories to my Tuscan dishes do have apples and grapes on them too. So these match them perfectly! I would definitely recommend these to others if you like this color scheme.  And the quality is good too.
1992,1,"the contact point between the blade and the motor is plastic, and both magic bullet (bought one and got one as gift) broke at the same spot. The plastic piece simply cannot handle the force. We ended up with bunch of cup/lid and have to throw them away. what a waste."
1993,5,What you see is exactly what you get.  This product arrived when specified and was properly packaged.  It is beautiful and well made.  My kids love it and they have fun thinking it's a village and the lighthouse is a hotel.  It is 13.5 inches from bottom to top of nob and 25 inches around the bottom.  The colors are such that it would fit in in almost any decor.  I would highly recommend this cookie jar.
1994,5,This item is made of quality materials and has brilliant colors. It will make a great stocking stuffer this season.
1995,5,"I make fresh iced tea several times per week. I use these pitchers exclusively due to their size, and ease of use. Simply pour in hot water and have fresh brewed tea in about 5 minutes using whole tea leaves. This fits in the refrigerator door great, which is why we have several of these."
1996,5,"These containers are really great, there's a lot of variety for different sizes perfect for all kinds of things. So far, I have stored: rice, salsa, diced onions, watermelon, scrambled eggs, and they have all stayed fresh as long as they possibly could (onions started to go bad after a few days).<br />I love how they snap closed, my guests are impressed by how secure the lids are.<br />I also like how I can store them inside of each other when I'm not using them. This is a great value and I prefer these way over the plastic tupperwares that I had in the past.<br />The glass is also thick and heavy, I am sure that they would not break easily."
1997,1,This unit is quite underpowered for my taste.  At best it keeps a cup of coffee above ambient temp. My advice would be to find a higher wattage unit.
1998,5,"The coffee stays drinkable-hot for at least 16 hours.  It is the best hot thermos air pump I have ever had.  I have two, one for the house and one for the camper.  You will love it!"
1999,4,"I have been using this for about 6 weeks. We love our coffee and lattes. I have limited counter space so I liked it being a combination unit and find I use it more than when I had separate units. It does not have a program feature, which I didn't realize and do miss that, but not a huge deal, teaches patience! I heat the milk for lattes in the microwave ahead of frothing, I've never found a home machine to get it hot enough. Every feature otherwise works great, not problems. Oh one other thing, the coffee side does not have an auto shut off, so remember to turn it off! Really a basic feature I think they should add, so no one burns their house down!<br />Think this is a good buy overall."
2000,1,"I bought this thing after seeing it on a TV show thinking it was genius. Only the product doesn't work, the ballon only stays inflated for 8-10 hours max and when it is inflated the bottle is not completely sealed and there is still a chance to spill the wine. Thought this was a great idea that just fell flat"
2001,4,Strong and work well. They don't stick to your glass when wet. Look great if you have to leave on table.
2002,3,"This review will be redundant, but I wanted to reinforce what others here have said. This pitcher's two main flaws are: 1) It drips from the thick rim, and 2) When it's full, it's quite heavy and hard to hold without any sort of handle.<br /><br />You can find it cheaper elsewhere.<br /><br />I use mine all the time as I live on  home-brewed ice tea each summer. However, now that I have a gift card burning a hole in my pocket, I plan to upgrade to something that doesn't have this pitcher's drawbacks and also fits better in my crowded refrigerator."
2003,2,"I've taken protein for 25+ years.  This is the best tasting but if I have two scoops before bed my stomach cramps sooooooo badly.  I've never experienced this before.  I've been told to increase my fluid intake, but I find it hard to believe that's the whole story because I've never had this happen with any other product.  I've had the cramping occur three times and it's crazy bad."
2004,5,"This is an excelent decanter, the piece came in better than expected. I cant wait to use it on my next dinner party."
2005,5,Owned this product for three years. Used monthly over that period of time. Nine knives bought at Sam's Club and Ikea. Each knife requires one to two minutes to achieve a mini-micro serration and results in a super sharp knife. I do not use a sharpening steel. I highly recommend this product.
2006,4,"I have not had a chance to actually make any candies yet, but I can say that the quality of the molds is very nice. Heavy and sturdy and has a very smooth surface.<br /><br />Thank you"
2007,5,"I needed a new coffee maker, so I started looking at reviews.  My last 2 coffee makers were Krups.  They were very good, but I just didn't want to spend over $100.00 for a coffee maker.  I already tried a Mr. Coffee and hated it.  Coffee was never hot enough.  My mom always used Melitta coffee makers.  I started reading the reviews and they were good.  I purchased this coffee make and I absolutely love it.  It's sleek and looks nice, but the best thing is, it makes a great cup of coffee that is VERY hot.  The coffee stays much hotter for a longer period of time in the thermal pot, then in my Krups. I would recommend this coffee maker to anyone."
2008,5,"These knives are in my kitchen for over a year, and I am very happy with them. They are great for basic kitchen jobs from salad to sushi making or even as a steak knife."
2009,5,"I read lots of reviews on lots of scales and chose this one because, among other things, people said it was easy to switch between grams, ounces, etc. And the service is good. I have had it a few weeks and it is easy to use and works well. It comes with a book that lists the calories per gram for hundreds of foods. I have found that to be a real plus. The scale is easy to use and works well."
2010,5,The product heats up fast and has very balanced feel when pouring. The balanced feel is critical since water is scolding hot!!!
2011,1,tooooooooo  slow!  so many parts to clean!!!<br /><br />was all excited...then used it!  little tiny pieces of carrots left in juice...<br />just what i DIDN'T want!<br /><br />where can i sell it???
2012,5,"Serves all purposes, even unpacking your furniture. Compact in size and goes great with small sized kitchens. The blades are just sharp enough to get your work done."
2013,4,I like this toaster.  Yes it does toast the crust a little more than the center but that does not bother me.<br />Nice design.  I like the cancel button and it toasts bagels.  Update...Toasts way more on one side then the other.  Will try to return item for new toaster. Will purchase same model again. Maybe mine was just defective?
2014,3,"The rack is made of black plastic...The jar lids and \\""handle\\"" are chromed plastic and not \\""stainless' as stated in the manufacturer's description and some of the jars do not fit securely into the rack so they can and will fall off.<br /><br />The assortment of spices that came with the rack I got leave a lot to be desired. Unlabeled or labeled, filled or unfilled, jars made for this particular spice rack can not be purchased from Olde Thompson and I have not been able to find them elsewhere.<br /><br />It does, however; look cute and doesn't take up much counter space...But,if you  want functionality, I would not recommend this product."
2015,1,This toaster stopped working properly after 6 weeks.  It now cooks on only one side which comes out dark or burned while the other side is not cooked at all. Too late to return it.
2016,5,great product! I've been making so many pies and the crust sticking and breaking was really starting to piss me off. I got this Harold Pie Crust Maker and now it's easy peasy.
2017,2,The shrimp Butler looked easy to use.  It did not take off the tales and devein very easily.  The shrimp repeatedly got stuck inside.
2018,1,This lunch box was much larger than expected. When its flattened out (i.e. empty) its bigger than a backpack. Sending mine back today.
2019,3,I've had my v-slicer for 30 years now and have almost sliced off a finger more than once. Dont even think about using this without the holder. To many unprotected razor sharp blades. Very dangerous piece of equipment! Other than that I found it very limited in the variety of cuts. I would like to make waffle fries but cannot with this. Also the slice blade is either too thin or too thick. The other blade hasnt been much use to me either. It has been sitting in the garage and not sure how to dispose of this. Im an experience home cook and make most everything from scratch. I've been looking for a different mandoline for some time and have not pulled the trigger as of yet.
2020,5,"This was a gift for my daughter who has borrowed my pans for years. She loves them, easy to use and the crepes turned out perfect!"
2021,5,"I had not idea a juicer could be so quiet and make so much juice with so little!  It is a beauty of a machine, takes up very little counter space, fits under the cabinet in my tiny kitchen.  I just made my favorite green juice and the pulp is totally dry and the juice it totally, totally yummy and made it with just scraps on hand and it made one whole cup. My retired juicer might have made 1/4 cup with that amount. It was essentially effortless, it took ginger and half a lime with not one grunt.  Beyond my wildest dreams.  I have been shopping for a juicer for awhile and I am so very pleased with this.  I could not wait to write this review.  I will do whatever it takes to keep this juicer clean and happy, as we will be friends for a good while, I trust.  If there is anything that I need to update I will do so as I learn more, but I am very happy so far."
2022,5,"I chose this pressure cooker because it's the only kind of pressure cooker I've had experience using, it is stainless steel (non reactive, heavy weight), it was less expensive than more modern incarnations of pressure cookers (electric countertop, stove non jiggle top), and the reviews and follow up comments were helpful in convincing me that this was a quality product.<br /><br />The reviews praise the quality construction of this cooker and I couldn't agree more. I have used both natural pressure release and the method to speed it up by sticking the cooker in the sink and running cold water from the faucet over it (it takes all of 20 seconds and doesn't have to be so complicated as making an ice bath for it in the sink). I have never seen any signs of the metal layers splitting, the pot warping, and there has been no denting from handling and washing. The 6-quart capacity is enough for me and my husband to have soup with some left over for lunch or another soup dinner, but not so much that we're sick of eating the same thing.<br /><br />If you are trying to decide whether to get a pressure cooker in general, I would encourage you to go for it. Most weeknights, I am too impatient to wait for time-intensive things like tomato sauce, stew meat, root veggies cut into chunks, lentils, risotto, or even just tender cabbage. Pressure cookers prepare these things quickly and make them taste like they've been cooking forever. Most of the pressure cooker recipes I use take 30-40 minutes total for prep and cook (I usually make soup in this cooker), so it's become a life saver when I come home from work late.<br /><br />If you already know you want a pressure cooker but are trying to decide what type to get, I would say that I don't mind the simplicity of this cooker. Normally the justification to get a product that is the \\""latest and greatest\\"" is that you are certain it will get a lot of use so you might as well spend the extra money for extra features that possibly save youtime. This basic model is fine for weekly use in my household. I am definitely curious about newer types of cookers, but personally wasn't ready to pay more money for something I wasn't sure I would need."
2023,5,"I love this pitcher.  It holds a full kettle's worth of ice tea.  It's sturdy.  Unlike another pitcher of a different brand I recently purchased, I've had no problem with cracking when hot liquids were poured into this pitcher.  And one cannot complain about it's looks."
2024,5,"I'm very pleased with my K-cup storage rack.  Looks just like the picture, and looks just as wonderful on my counter!"
2025,5,"Order the 3 pak when you order the pitcher.  I was able to save more money on the filters and on shipping by doing so.  The pitcher has an indicator which lets you know when to replace the filter. FYI Be sure to inspect all 3 filters when they arrive before storing them away for future use.  Mine were perfect, but a couple of reviewers said they were disappointed when they discovered a problem months later."
2026,2,"I gave these pans 2 stars instead of 1 because they are indeed non-stick, and clean up easily.  That said, they're smaller than I expected. Pay attention to the dimensions given if you don't want an unpleasant surprise. They're also quite thin.  The first thing I baked burned on the bottom.  I'll probably need to set them inside another pan next time, to create insulation.  Also, they buckle under even moderately high heat. Honestly, these are about as sturdy as some of my children's play cookware.  Definitely not recommended."
2027,5,"Bought two of these for the professional look.  Used them at a baby shower and everyone raved how professional the tables looked.  Spilled drops of chocolate and tomato sauce came out.  I was sceptical about purchasing these because I didn't think they would come clear, but they did!!!!  Will order another one shortly.  L O V E  THEM!!!!"
2028,5,"Just sweet and so sharp.  Sharpens in a jiffy and hold an edge.  Very well made.  If you can find one, snap it up."
2029,5,"My (much) better half was using a 20+ year-old thrift-store mixer to make the magic in the kitchen that she does so well. The problem was that when she turned on that ol' thing, the TV went haywire,the lights would flicker,and one needed ear protection from the crazy noise level.<br /> Santa finally got the message, and produced this mixer as a gift. What a difference ! Compared to the old mixer, this is almost silent. Much lighter weight, much easier to handle. Santa did well this time.<br /> This mixer has plenty of torque for the cakes, pies and sweetbreads, even on the lowest settings. She hasn't used it for mixing bread dough, as that task is handled by the bread-maker machine. In 7 months of use, absolutely no complaints or problems.<br /> My better half loves it, and when Momma is happy the odds of my happiness increase proportionally."
2030,5,I love egg mcmuffins but they take time to do them at home and they are expensive for what yuou get.THIS MACHINE IS DA BOMB!I dont write many reviews on products but this one deserves one. I did a taste test next to Micky D's with a friend of mine and he picked the one I made.The best part is that they cost maybe twenty-five cents to make. Get this thing you cant miss breakfast sandwiches 24/7. Oh  it makes great toast also. Caution: dont put cheese in the steamer
2031,5,I absolutely LOVE IT! I had one before it that burned up withina week of buying it. I orderedthis one and it has so much power!
2032,4,The mug was ok quality. I purchased 2. One had some small chips around the rim. The Hofbrauhaus decals are smaller than the original mugs.  Not bad for the price.
2033,5,"I've been using a Teflon set of Bialetti cookware for many years and wanted to supplement my set. Got the recommendation from a web cooking show and made the purchase based on past experience with the brand, cost (very reasonable), recommendations, and looks (they go with the Wolf red very nicely).<br /><br />Been cooking on these for a month or so now and can state with certainty that they are the best performing pans I've ever used. Nothing sticks to them, I can see the progress of browning as it occurs due to the white interiors, and the pans are light weight enough to encourage flipping rather than stirring.<br /><br />My pans are stored in a drawer under the cooktop and I put kitchen towels between each to avoid scratching them. This has worked for me so far.<br /><br />Construction is light duty - handles are connected with a central bolt only and are likely to become loose after some time. I'd be happier if they had this set with riveted handles as on my other Bialetti set.<br /><br />The set did not come with covers - fortunately the covers from my previous set fit well. It would be nice if covers were available open stock.<br /><br />All in all this set of pans was well worth what I paid for them both in terms of performance and looks. I've recommended them to a few friends and will likely add more pieces to my collection over time.<br /><br />I'll report back if they deteriorate.<br /><br />======================================<br />Updated 12/28/2013:<br /><br />I've now been using the cookware for well over a year. I can now state without hesitation that I love this product. Enough so that I've purchased additional pieces.<br /><br />Here is my experience:<br /><br />1. I store them with kitchen towels between each piece to reduce the chances of chipping the coating.<br /><br />2. I mostly use wooden spoons to stir, or the occasional plastic spatula.<br /><br />3. There are two types of handle attachment - some have screwed on handles, others are riveted. I greatly prefer the riveted but have been able to keep the others tightened with an occasional twist of a Phillips driver.<br /><br />4. I hand wash with liquid soap and a sponge with synthetic scrubby back. Mostly don't need to use that.<br /><br />5. On the rare occasion that I totally crisped something on a pot bottom I used my trusty Japanese bamboo scrubber. Made easy work of it.<br /><br />6. The non-stick properties have certainly degraded a bit with use, but it is still intact and still works better than new Teflon ever did.<br /><br />7. Stains are just a mild discoloration on some items, mostly from very colorful spices I use (like turmeric, which will stain anything).<br /><br />8. For the price they are a fantastic value."
2034,4,The coffemaker was delivered on time and in good condition.  I like the larger 80 ounce water reservoir and the water filter compared to the 60 ounce reservoir in the Kuerig B70 I had previously.  The filter should help extend the life of the machine.  It has been working flawlessly since we started using it about one month ago.
2035,5,"This unit is gorgeous.  BTW - They sent mine with the metal handle, not the black plastic handle in the photo."
2036,5,I absolutly love this canner. It is so easy to use and the instructions are very easy to follow. My old canner had a rubber gasket which had to be replaced from time to time and this one does not. I love that feature. I am so glad I decided to go with the All American canner.[[ASIN:B00004S88Z All American 921 21-1/2-Quart Pressure Cooker/Canner]]
2037,4,"I had a princess theme for our daughters first birthday. These are super cute for such a theme, and worked awesome with the sugar cookies we made. Only complaint is some are a tad on the small side."
2038,5,"This is a nifty way to keep a few cups of tea warm and ready for use. The tea infuser is a nice addition to the product; it's great to use for loose tea leaves or you can take it out and use regular bags. It has a nice weight to it, meaning it doesn't feel light and cheap. Pretty sturdy, but it's not too heavy so it's not cumbersome to use."
2039,5,"Nice looking, lots of attachments plus bowl.  Works well.  My daughter has taken over cooking for me and she likes it."
2040,5,"With any amount of head, these are a little small for a 12-ounce bottle of beer, but they're not intended to be big glasses.  The pictures show them filled nearly to the brim, but I think that your tasting experience is better if there's more headspace than that.  They are medium-weight, which I like.  Fine crystal is for wine; beer glasses shouldn't be dainty.  I like these for bigger, stronger-tasting beers, which certainly is a fair characterization for some Belgian beers (e.g., a quad versus a Saison).  So don't get these just for big Belgian beers.  I like these for a barleywine as well as an imperial stout.<br /><br />Of course, it's all a matter of taste.  Just my opinion.  But these are good glasses for what they're good for.  Not expensive and neither dainty nor overly heavy."
2041,5,The programmed smoothie cycle on this blender is the best.  It also does frozen drinks better than any blender I've ever had.  Never leaves any ice chunks behind.  Not bad looking on the counter either!
2042,3,"Had this toaster for 5 years. About 2 years ago the egg part quit heating, so we used it as a toaster until a couple weeks ago when the toaster part quit heating. We really liked it when it worked. It made a great breakfast sandwich, and it was fast and easy to use."
2043,1,"DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B002Q1MCMU Amazing Super Wash Ball (Set of 2) - Never Use Laundry Detergent or Powder Again.]]<br /><br />The product shipped in no way represents the product listed on Amazon:<br /><br />The product is packaged in two very old and shabby-looking boxes with no English printed on them.  There were several languages, but no English.  The only way I could make any sense of how to use these laundry balls was to go to the web site embossed on the product:  smartklean.com.  I found instructions there.<br /><br />There was a cryptic note on the invoice written in poor English:  \\""This model is new and improved with added magnitic pow er!  Color may Very and style can be different.  Now sented.\\""  I definitely do not want scented!<br /><br />The product capability on the smartklean web site was far less than that advertised on Amazon.  Amazon advertised the product could be used for up to 1,000 washes, while the smartklean site said the product could be used for up to 365 washes.  This is about 1/3 of what Amazon advertised.<br /><br />I am not the first customer to receive this inferior product:  there is already a comment in a review on Amazon feedback that another customer received an unacceptable product.  I don't know if Amazon did followup, but the seller is still sending inferior product.  I don't think Amazon should continue to deal with this seller as his practices reflect very poorly on Amazon.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B002Q1MCMU Amazing Super Wash Ball (Set of 2) - Never Use Laundry Detergent or Powder Again.]]"
2044,4,"If you want crystals on your very dry martini, this is the way to \\""shake not stir\\"". Use lots of ice and have that metal top popped in the freezer along with the glass bottom and you will be able to serve the perfect martini....dry or dirty!"
2045,4,"When I needed to replace my Oster, KitchenAid won out because of its reputation and the power of the motor. First problem I had was the jar started leaking. In talking with Customer Service, I was reminded to always crush ice using the crush ice setting. It's possible I did crush ice a couple of times without using this feature, so I contributed to my own undoing. However, Customer Service kindly sent me a new jar, free of charge. Since that time, I have been careful to always crush ice appropriately. 2nd time jar failed was not my fault. I began to crush ice for a smoothie, using the crush ice setting, and the blades sheared completely!  So, since the unit is out of warranty, I will buy a new jar.  I attribute that failure to blades not being made of strong enough steel.  Still a top-notch blender, but as I only use it for smoothies, if it ever fails, I should look for a unit designed specifically to make smoothies and shakes."
2046,5,"rec'vd lots of compliments on this, friends had no idea this was an actual funnel as it looks real. great size! use it often and would recommend!"
2047,3,"sparkles are ok - but melt into the frosting and don't show up as nicely as they should, container was 1/3 empty. Packaged nicely, shipped on time, just was disappointed iwth the product itself."
2048,5,"Really great popcorn maker.<br /><br />It pops up in less than a minute, really fast and effective. If you feel like having some popcorn, just put some inside, plug it in the power plug and that is it!<br /><br />It is butter/fat free, which is a good thing. But at the same time, it is so dry that the salt does not sticks in.<br /><br />For that purpose, you will have to get some sort of butter or popcorn-oil, but that is not an issue at all."
2049,5,"First let me say that I did not read anyone elses' reviews, recently, that is.  I didn't want to be influenced, lol, so if any of my problems have been solved by other writers, please forgive me. I used this jerky gun tonite to whip up about 5 pounds (wet) of deer jerky.  I used it off and on for about 1 hour.  This thing is great.  The only bad things are fairly minor, and 1 is nit-picky.  The first thing is the yellow/orange release button is somewhat hard to push to release the plunger in order to pull the plunger back.  The second thing is there is a lump of meat left in the fitting on the end of the shooter at the end of the process.  I had to fish the lump out with a butter knife and make little clumps of jerky by hand.  I am going to write the manufacturer and ask them if they have a plastic plug that can be used with each fitting to push the last of the meat out of the nozzles, regardless of which nozzle is used.  This shooter is very powerful and measured.  By that I mean I never had any clogs or uneven strips--it has the power to push meat out at a precise rate. Cleanup was great.  Soap and hot water, and everything cleaned up great. One word of caution, when you get to the end of a load, don't force it. Just accept this is the end of this load, and re-load. If you force it, it's harder to get the plunger button pushed in to release. I had a cleaper jerky shooter (the red plastic one) that I bought in a kit about 10 years ago. This is like comparing nite and day, and you can fit about 2x as much jerky into this Weston gun.  If I ever have any problems with this unit, I will come back and post.  Again, this is a great jerky gun!"
2050,1,"I really loved this can opener because it was so cute and it seemed well made!  However, after a while it stop working and only worked backwards.  TODAY it completely self destructed and fell apart completely!  I am very sad that it didn't work at out."
2051,5,I love these coffee filters and use them everyday with my Keurig.  A hint that might be helpful if you aren't getting a strong enough cup of coffee - I actually rip off the top covers since I find they dilute the coffee and I get a much stronger cup with the bottom part of the filter only.  I started buying the larger packs because they're a much better deal per filter; they can get expensive in the 50-packs.
2052,5,I received this pots and pans as a birthday present to go in to my newly remodeled kitchen.  I love the red color!  I have arthritis so I really liked the weight of the pots and pans and the handles were easy to hold.  They are light without feeling flimsy.  They cook like a dream with no sticking.
2053,5,"LIKE THE EVER READY BUNNY, THIS OPENER JUST KEEPS ON RUNNING. IT IS EASY TO USE, QUICK AND OPENS ENOUGH WINE FOR ANY DINNER PARTY YOU MIGHT THROW. LOVE IT!"
2054,5,"I've been using these for years. My only complaint would be that it would be nice to be able to buy replacement lids easily, as a few of them have fallen on the bottom of the dishwasher and melted. These containers are great to have on hand, and are much nicer than the plastic kind.<br /><br />At first the lids can be hard to put on and remove, but it gets easier after the first few times."
2055,5,As an avid soup-maker I truly appreciate the power and convenience of this Cuisinart stick blender.  Sure beats portioning the hot soup into a conventional blender!
2056,5,"Great opener, works like a charm. Tucked away under cabinet is great.  Just slip you jar in and it's open."
2057,4,"A little smaller than I expected.  I should have noted the measurements of it, but it's really cute.  Using the cookie cutter for sandwiches for a tea party.  Unfortunately the shipping of this item was more than the cookie cutter because my order was split up."
2058,5,I would recommend this model. works great and brews a quick cup of coffee. The one thing I found is it doesn't accept the k-cup for your favorite ground coffee. You need to purchase the ekobrew cup instead.
2059,4,"Great Product for the price. I have a couple minor issues with the product, but as you know it's $3 so I think I can deal with them.<br />The parts fit loosely and don't screw in nicely like the machines that made it were slightly off. This is what I am assume happened and why the price is so low. I read the reviews and some people got grinders that wouldn't open period, and I can see that, but for me it is worth the risk because if I had had a problem with I could've just sent it back in, no biggie. Also the holes are a little large, and even though I washed it out I ended with 2 tiny aluminium specks in my keif, but nothing major, just rinse the thing out before you use it.<br />If your looking for a great 4pc look somewhere else this is a mediocre product, and that is why the price is so good. But if your like me and just need something to break up your 'herbs', are tight on cash, or just don't need an amazing $50, $60 grinder this is for you."
2060,5,"I think that this is one of the best salt mills I have ever owned. I particularly like the fact that the grinding mechanism is ceramic and not metal, so it doesn't corrode. The size is good and it is easy to adjust how course or fine you want it to be."
2061,4,"Purchased this cooler for a camping trip to which we were flying, so I needed something that would fit in a suitcase. Overall I'm pleased, held about ten beer bottles and some snacks. Reach through flap is a great feature for quick access without unzipping the top. Heavy duty fabric and handles seem like they will be durable in the long run. The plastic inner liner did not leak and offered good insulation. Cooler would benefit from a shoulder strap but it does not come with one and there are no hooks to attach one. The collapsible feature was the main draw for me, and it worked well, but the cooler still takes up some space when folded up, so don't expect it to be thin as a pancake."
2062,1,does not work properly. does not heat. not happy with this product. not worth it.do not buy it. wouldn't recommend it to anyone
2063,5,"I purchased these as I wanted to get away from the PLASTIC containers I currently use. I love these! Great value, easy to clean, store, reheat leftovers and they don't stain when using tomatoe sauces, etc. I am going to buy another set as I transition out of plastic containers."
2064,5,It works very well for single smoothies or shakes and isn't messy at all. A very quick simply machine that satisfys all of my morning health needs!
2065,5,"My wife and I love our Bunn coffee maker.  We've used Bunn for years and wouldn't go back to other types.  It makes excellent coffee in a few minutes.  It's the brand used by the Tim Horton's coffee shop chain across Canada and parts of the U.S.;  if it's good enough for them, it should be good enough for anybody!  They use their own, deeper filters, which are available at Walmart for about $1.50/100."
2066,5,"I love this pan!  On first receiving this pan, I knew that it would be perfect.  The weight of it, the balance of it, and the comfortable silicon handle were all signs that this was an awesome pan. Cooking with it was a dream.  The honeycomb pattern allowed for great heating and I barely had to use any oil to keep the food from sticking.  Cleaning it was also a breeze.  The food just wiped right off.  The best part is that I can be confident when I'm cooking that no harmful chemicals will seep into the food because of the great stick-free ceramic coating.  I would recommend this pan to anyone!"
2067,5,This has made my eggs look like they were made in a restaurant I love it. My husband loves it too.
2068,2,"The description of these dishes states : DISHWASHER SAFE, MICROWAVE SAFE, OVEN SAFE TO 350 F.<br />The only thing these dishes say on them is Dishwasher safe, so far so good on that.<br />1 plate ruined finish after using it in the microwave to reheat food.<br />Plate got extremely hot and the coloring got an icky hazed look.<br />I would not dare put these in the oven.<br />so now cant even reheat coffee in the microwave with these mugs<br />Ordered 2 sets to replace our old ones.<br />They were pretty but the advertisement I think is false!"
2069,5,"This throw back delivers 4 mug size cups of very hot and very good tasting coffee.  Grind your favorite coffee bean and fill the metal filter with 1 Table spoon of coffee for each mug, boil, percolate, and enjoy.  This is way better than a coffee maker.  The only better coffee is \\""caf&eacute; de olla\\"".  Don't let the price fool you, at $19.99 it's a steal.  Buy 2.  Take one to your favorite relative's house so you can have a good cup of coffee when you visit them."
2070,5,"I am not a cake decorator but this pan was easy with good instructions. We bought it for my daughter's 8th birthday party, The c<br />ake turned out cute and was a big hit."
2071,4,"Ive owned several of these. After an accident with one that nearly took the end of my finger off I went several years without one (never try to clean out the blade area with your finger, no matter what kind of hurry you are in!) I got this at Christmas because i was really missing the ability to puree soups right in the pan. It is great. It works perfectly, great for soups! I do wish it had a higher speed sometimes but it gets the job done. Dont use it for mashed potatoes, not a great consistency. Great quality for the price."
2072,5,"To be fair, I've only just gotten this thing and used it once, but...I ran an apple across it, and immediately thought, \\""Wow, this thing's a piece of crap.\\"" Then I looked under it and there were two thin, perfect apple slices. There was NO resistance in the cutting and I didn't even think it was working! It sliced through the rest of that apple like butter. I am so impressed! Can't wait to try the other cuts, but if this is all it does and does it this well for 18 bucks, I am a happy camper! Seems well-made, nice and sturdy, and has a nice little storage box, too."
2073,4,They were a great asset to our party as most beers are going to cans.  There were only 2 out of 60 that leaked. Not bad for plastic. probably because there were stuck together.
2074,4,I have tried many things like this but they never work.<br /><br />So I purchased this product at Wall... you know the rest for $6.00 this was the best money I ever spent.<br /><br />I purchased this version because it looks cool but works the same.<br /><br />I have one for home and work and I also keep one in my car.<br /><br />Doubles as a great water bottle
2075,2,This is the second replacement I've had to order for this coffee maker. The first broke when I hit the side of the sink while cleaning. The second broke when I was cleaning it with a long-handled brush. It never should have broken so easily. Do they not expect me to clean it? Jeez!
2076,5,Food grinder works great as long as you keep the pieces fairly small.  Being able to use it attached to my mixer is great since it leaves your hands free to load the meat and package it.  It cleans up very easily as well.
2077,5,Just received my RR Oven Lovin' 5pc Baking set and very happy. The quality is high and expected from her collection. Good price here on Amazon since I looked everywhere else. I would recommend to those of you who love to bake.
2078,5,"The containers seem to be of good quality and the lids have a very good seal and are very easy to put and remove.<br /><br />The lids have a flower pattern. It's shown in the photos, I didn't notice that when I ordered this set. I wouldn't have ordered this set if I had noticed that. My fault for not watching the photos closely. I'm going stick with them since they still serve the same purpose."
2079,5,Exellent product! See Sweetmarias for more info.I could have got it $25 cheaper on E-Bay but I wanted it asap.
2080,4,"This was on my husband's Christmas list.  He loves this dicer.  He says it cleans up easily and works wonderfully on carrots, celery, and onions."
2081,1,"got rid of my fryer after only a few uses because the grease would over-flow a minute or two after putting the food in. would have only used once but wanted to make sure i didnt do something wrong. tried putting in new oil, checked the level and still it was over flowing. extremely dangerous and made a mess!!"
2082,3,1 of my 16oz glasses was cracked from bottom going halfway up the glass. Disappointed that I am starting off my set with 1 short. Too much trouble to pack them all up and send them back.
2083,5,"I work at a computer, & I had just one to many times of spilling my coffee & having to clean-up that whole mess (thank goodness none of it got on the computer.) Anyway, I was looking for something that is spill-proof. I saw this, & it was on sale too, & I just love the color. I tested it out. Shook it upside down w/hot water in it as hard as I could... not a drop came out :-D<br />I am very please w/my new mug. Just one caution, the hot beverage stays hot for a good long time, so be careful when taking a drink from it, I was surprised how hot it stayed, even an hour later, & well... yeah... burned my tongue, but, at least I can no longer spill it."
2084,3,"My husband and I have been using this for a few months now. In general the coffee brewed by it is quite good. Unfortunately the \\""double screen\\"" effect doesn't do much to filter out the sediment. I'm now wowed by it, but it's small, portable and makes a good cup of coffee."
2085,3,"I purchased a whole assortment of these Le Creuset silicone tools, one by one, in many different exciting colors because,<br /><br />1. Woo! Exciting colors!<br />and<br />2. I was hoping to invest in well made, long lasting, high quality kitchen tools instead of using the rusted, breaking,  nasty tools I've had for over 10 years. I logged into Amazon and I placed a naive and childlike trust into the Le Creuset brand believing that I wouldn't end up with yet another brand name that only backs its quality as far as \\""Made in China\\"" goes.<br /><br />When the various tools arrived from both Amazon direct and this reseller they looked nice and even though I haven't had them long enough to really comment on quality, the few times I've used these tools they've worked well.<br />However, this is the first time I've used this kind of silicone tool as a saute spoon so I have no frame of comparison reference here at all so do take that faint praise with a grain of sel de mer.<br /><br />There was, however, one huge issue for me in general regarding these Le Creuset silicone products and one issue SPECIFICALLY with this item.<br /><br />General Shock:<br />Half of the items arrived with \\""Made in China\\"" stickers on them, but nowhere on the page contents did it mention that these were or could be made in China. The whole point for me of getting the Le Creuset brand was to hopefully get something with superior French or even American craftsmanship.<br /><br />I have had junk, this time I wanted grown-up good stuff that would last and that I could take pride in on a deeper level than just a brand name. I wouldn't have bothered with this brand just for the sake of the name if I had known I'd do just as well with something else.<br /><br />Specific Shock Regarding this Item:<br />It says on the package and on the tool \\""FOR RIGHT HANDED USE.\\""<br />It says that nowhere on the page though. I really don't get that.<br /><br />----Leftie persecution complex rant mode ON----<br />As a left-handed person I pretty much expect the world to work for right-handed people.<br />I suppose the reseller thought that mentioning that this item was very specifically for right-handed use would be as redundant as saying a car is for the use of a person with legs or something, but it seems such a simple thing to have mentioned. MEET ME HALF WAY HERE FOLKS!<br /><br />And does that mean somewhere there are left-handed use models as well? Why not let me know that too? I would have purchased those instead.<br /><br />All-in-all I probably wouldn't strongly recommend this product above other brands / products for those reasons if you find other items / brands for a better price or colors that float your boat more.<br /><br />Now, if you're keeping track here, yes, I have actually spent about 15 minutes of my life committing to writing me whining about the fact that a colorful silicon saute spoon from an upscale French brand of specialized cooking equipment is possibly made in China and is for right-handed people and that neither fact was mentioned in the product description.<br /><br />I am certain that you, my esteemed review reader, are probably thanking your lucky stars that I am not your wife or boss or something because I take very minimal and trifling issues VERY SERIOUSLY, and am pretty much epitomizing \\""petty white woman problems\\"" here.<br /><br />I feel I must leap in to defend myself here (as I am fairly certain nobody else will) and say in my own defense that \\""You are quite possibly right, but animals and the elderly seem to find me charming so please don't judge me too harshly.\\""<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Color is great<br />-Hasn't broken after several uses<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Possibly made in China<br />-FOR RIGHT HANDED USE"
2086,4,"We raised three sons using the \\""classic\\"" mason jars with handles.  They were fantastic!  Heavy enough to have a minimal number of tabletop disastrous beverage spills and to minimize breakage.  The boys are mostly grown now and we are a little more sophisticated.  I bought some beautiful glasses with designs on them.  Most of them have broken in the dishwasher by now: the glass too delicate to withstand the trauma of washing.  That's pretty pitiful.  So it was either back to mason jars or find a substitute.  When I saw these Anchor hocking cafe mugs, I knew I was on to something.  We've had them something like 1-2 months now and really like them.  You can nuke 'em in the micro and they come out slightly warm but not hot.  There is a seam from manufacturing on them.  It's not noticeable to me although my husband, who is very picky about textures [certain shirt labels drive him crazy] noticed the seam initially although he hasn't said anything about them lately.  I deducted one star because of the seam.  These cafe mugs have a nice weight to them and I like the look.  Wish I could get some 6 ounce sizes for fruit juice."
2087,5,"I purchased this toaster to replace a Black and Decker 4 slice I'd bought less than a year ago.  The Black and Decker was slightly more expensive and I was never quite happy with it.  The slots on that toaster made removing items like english muffins near impossible as they always fell beside the mechanism that lifted them.  I'd inevitably have to unplug the unit and fish my english muffin (or bagel) out.  Then one of the toaster units simply stopped working.  I'd had enough and decided to give this Hamilton Beach a try.<br /><br />I could not be happier.  The design is fantastic.  The mechanisms that hold and &#34;pop&#34; the toasted items are perfect.  No matter what you put in: toast, bagel, english muffin or pop tart... it works perfectly.  The design does not let anything I've tried to toast in it fall and need to be fished out.  It toasts consistently and evenly.  Incredible value for the money.  Highly recommend.<br /><br />Edit: Almost six years later and it's still working as well as the day I bought it. One of the best products I've ever bought."
2088,5,High volume capacity which hold alot of liquids (so minimum refilling) small spout for easy drizzling. Great for infusing herbs and olive oil. Highly recommend!!!
2089,5,"Love my new food processor. I was given a DLC-8 food processor for a wedding shower gift 29 years ago, and it finally died. I had lots of extra blades and attachments etc. from the old one that I still wanted to use, so this new DLC-8S fit the bill. The differences are slight: a bit more reinforcement on the lid (not that I had a problem with that with the old one) and a thinner cord (it seems to do the job, so I guess it's OK) and I love that it is even more quiet than my last. A lock for the cover, which I didn't need, but I could see why they added it. I also love the flat top cover that allows me to just use it for chopping without having to use the taller chute feed cover. I like having both, my old one did not have the flat cover included. It works like a dream, as expected. As to Amazon, the delivery came quickly and in good shape, as always."
2090,1,It annoys me that the size of the pans in this set is not specified.  Nor are the contents of any of the larger sets indicated.  So what are you getting?  Your guess is as good as any.  Rich
2091,5,"Finally a real honest to goodness non-stick fry pan.  Bought the 10-inch a month ago and was so impressed with its non-stick qualities that I added the 8-inch fry pan.  Making omelets is finally a joy.  The omelet slides free everytime - with no need for a spatula.  Slips right onto the plate and looks picture perfect.  Great for hashbrowns, Canadian bacon, etc --- which usually stick to other pans when browning.  We use both pans almost everyday."
2092,5,"[[VIDEOID:mo169J79ZAA6Y5L]]Thinks of these more of a spatula replacement than tongs.  These 12\\"" are perfect for applications that need a soft touch, even grip where normal tongs might crush, or a gentle 2-sided tongs.  They are by far more limited in use than normal tongs.  But they are perfect for the right situations.  Honestly, they are not noodle strainers or anything universal.  I have long believed in using the right tools for the right application.  I think every kitchen needs a stock of the right utensils for the right purpose.  These are perfect as a spatula replacement with fine control as a spatula / tongs hybrid.  For example, we use them to flip quesadillas on a grill where too often we burn our hand from hot cheese on the side or don't have room to just do a flip.  Or we need to flip a vegetable patty in a fry pan that might fall apart with normal tongs and no room to just flip with a spatula.  My wife really likes these tongs.  We use these less frequently, but are perfect when the right application presents itself.  They are non-stick silicone so grip will be limited, but things will not stick.  They have an even flat grasp along the whole end which is nicer than the uneven claw grip of normal tongs.  I would not use these on a barbeque.  Don't leave them in the pan.  Set them aside on a spoon rest or plate when not using.  They are comfortable to use and feel like an extension of my arm with great control.  But do match the right tongs to the right application.  I highly recommend  Every kitchen needs a variety of tools to suit the particular application.  These are excellent for their applications.  Oxo has other tongs that are suited to other applications.  I highly recommend the [[ASIN:B00004OCK1 OXO Good Grips 12-Inch Stainless-Steel Locking Tongs]] for the barbeque.  I highly recommend the [[ASIN:B0000CCY1L OXO Good Grips 12-Inch Locking Tongs with Nylon Heads]] for non-stick surfaces."
2093,5,"I simmer Chinese medicinal herbs for hours at a time. However, I have a gas stove. Even at the lowest setting it would boil rather than simmer. This diffuser saved the day and works as advertized."
2094,1,"I was excited to receive this Omega juicer as it has the stainless basin and is supposed to be the 'top of the line' for this type of product, but was horribly disappointed in it's performance. It has trouble juicing just about everything, no matter how slow you feed it, and it shakes and moves so much it's literally dangerous to use. And the cleanup is a nightmare. I bought a package of filters for it thinking that would make it easier to clean, but not really. I bought this juicer in an effort to interest my husband in a juice fast but the Omega is such a poor preformer that it completely turned him off of the idea.  He won't touch it, and it shakes so much and is such a piece of crap that I would feel bad selling it to anyone for more than $10!! No way would I put this thing on eBay for sale under my username - I'd surely get negative feedback from whoever bought it!! I can't return it as I already threw the box away so i guess i'll take this heap of junk to the donation bin at the local Goodwill.  I bought a Breville juicer and we just love it. I have no idea how this Omega product is even on the market when people could just buy a Breville juicer. Do not waste your money on anything Omega sells, I feel that I have been ripped off-"
2095,5,"Purchased this scale few weeks ago after joining Weight Watchers. Can't say enough good things about it. Can use in ounces, pounds or grams. Easy to use and so helpful in trying to track what you are eating and portion control. I highly recommend this scale."
2096,5,"I was so pleased to find the Oneida Boston pattern, as I had not seen it in any stores.  It arrived in perfect condition, and I felt the price was quite reasonble."
2097,5,I bought these as a gift! They arrived quickly and in perfect condition. The tervis tumblers are great gift ideas and must haves for your home.
2098,3,The holder is not as shown on picture. It is only a short sleeve doesn't go all the way up to top of boards. Other than that the boards are fine. Countertop tidier. Material of cutting boards not heavy duty so first use shows deep cuts already.
2099,5,This would be great if paired with sme gourmet food and put in a gift basket as a hostess gift. VEry good quality.
2100,5,"I have been making esspresso drinks for a few years with a Gaggia Classic. Prior to a recent move to an apartment, I was using a compost pail to knock my pucks in which worked fairly well. In my apartment, this just isn't feasible so I purchased this knockbox for its small size. It fits on the Gaggia Classic drip tray when not in use so it is out of the way. I find that the knockbox absorbs quite a bit of the blow and I only need to knock once in most cases. There are no messy grinds all over the place and the portafilter basket isn't knocking out. I typically empty daily or if there are about 3 or 4 pucks. A quick rinse is all that is necessary when finished and perhaps a hand wash every once in a while. I plan to continue using the knockbox even when I am able to compost again because it is superior to simply knocking into a pail."
2101,5,The best knife i have ever bought.  Best quality i have ever seen.  There will be more Shun Premier Knife's in my kitchen.
2102,4,"To set the stage - I've been using the same Hampton Silversmiths \\""Bistro\\"" flatware set since 2000, and I've been very happy with them.  While I did start perusing flatware off and on about a year ago, I'm in no real hurry to replace them and not prone to sing the praises of just any nice flatware that comes my way.<br /><br />That said, these utensils are quite nice and I'm happy that I was able to audition them.  Style is all personal preference, and you can likely tell from the pictures if you like that.  I'll discuss what you can't see.  I think that the construction and build quality are excellent, with consistent fit and finish throughout.  The heft is nice, with the exception of the knife that seems overly heavy to me, and all pieces have good balance.  The surfaces are very smooth and comfortable (with one exception listed below).  The utensils came packaged nicely to prevent shipping damage.  I've been mostly handwashing them because I just have one set, but I've run them through the dishwasher at least a couple of times to check for issues and can't see any change in the appearance.<br /><br />The one thing that I really don't like, and the reason for removing a star, is the makers mark on the spoons.  The mark is, IMO, the single flaw in the comfort of the spoons.  The mark annoys me because I can feel it every time I put one in my mouth.  The mark on the forks isn't so bad because my lips don't tend to touch that part of a fork, but they touch the back portion of a spoon all of the time.  If they had to mark them, I wish that it would have been where the base of the cup meets the handle where neither hand nor mouth would tend to touch it.  Because I like everything else about the spoons, I've been using these for over a month now to try and get used to it, but I haven't - at least, not yet.<br /><br />Despite not loving the knife, I'd consider getting a full set of these if it weren't for the mark.  However, because of it, I won't be ordering any more.<br /><br />If you are used to such a mark, or are able to try out some spoons with one and don't mind it, then I recommend trying these.  They really are very nicely made.  At the current price of $30 a setting, these do seem pricey to me - especially if you're getting enough for a family.  I think that $20/service would be a decent (if not great) value.  Even that would be about twice what I paid for my previous set, but these are a step up.<br /><br />A note on the 18/10 steel.  From what I've read, I think that's a bonus in this case because these are polished and the nickel provides a nice sheen.  I've read how much better 18/10 (same as 18/8) is than 18/0 in regards to corrosion resistance, so I wouldn't even consider 18/0 flatware when I was looking last year.  That is, until I found the packaging to my 11-year-old set last month and saw that it was 18/0.  Imagine my surprise!  I have never seen any signs of rust on my flatware - none.  They have been left in water (or dipping in pools of water in a bowl) for extended periods from time to time for over a decade.  Of course, everyone's mileage may vary, but I'm less averse to 18/0 now.  18/10 is more corrosion resistant and offers some insurance, so I do think that it's worth more.  I'm just not convinced that I need it, given that I don't plan on passing down my flatware as an heirloom.<br /><br />Overall, these have a lot of nice qualities.  I don't like the mark on the spoons and am not a huge fan of the large knife, so I won't buy any more.  Given the pros, though, you might want to consider these (especially if you can see them in person at a store near you).<br /><br />Pros:<br /> - Sturdy construction<br /> - Consistent fit and finish (with one very minor mark on one spoon, which was under the polish)<br /> - Nicely polished surfaces<br /> - Great balance<br /> - 18/10 steel (apparently the same at 18/8, but a step up from 18/0)<br /><br />Cons (for me, anyway):<br /> - The makers mark on the spoons<br />- The knife is larger and heavier than I prefer.  I think that it might be problematic for younger kids."
2103,5,"The OXO tea kettle is a well made kettle and the lack of a seam is definitely a plus. The lid is slightly difficult to remove, but probably needed to ensure the kettle whistles.  I would recommend this tea kettle to everyone EXCEPT someone with arthritis or who cannot lift heavy weights because, when filled, this is a very, very heavy tea kettle.  Also, when you are pouring, the tightness of the lid creates a vacuum and there is almost always a small gush of water that spills out next to the cup.  The only \\""cure\\""  which, of course, breaks the vacuum, is to loosen the lid.  The looser lid, while it stops the kettle from spilling, also eliminates the whistle.  All in all, though, we are very pleased with the looks and good construction of the OXO tea kettle."
2104,5,"This is the only bread keeper I've found actually shaped like a real loaf of bread.  It is well made (in the USA), with a very tight locking lid with gasket - dishwasher-safe, too! I got this bread keeper to store my homemade bread using the USA Pan Pullman 13x4x4 pan.  [[ASIN:B002UNMZPI USA Pans 13 x 4 x 4 Inch Pullman, Aluminized Steel with Americoat]]  Excellent combination of products. I got tired of oddly shaped loaves from my bread machine & the stubby loaves made from loaf pans. The Pullman pan produces a loaf like store-bought ones, and the Lock & Lock bread container keeps it perfectly.  Inside the container is a sort of \\""divider\\"" that cradles the cut end of the loaf, keeping it fresh. I am thrilled w/ it!  No more zip-top bags to store my bread in!"
2105,1,"I'm a guy who LOVES cooking, loves helping out in the kitchen. My wife and I often share duties and this model crockpot has been in our cupboard and on our shelf, simmering away, for several years. I know NOTHING lasts forever, but I sure would have liked to keep this one around by replacing a lid and a handle. Alas, there are NO REPLACEMENT PARTS available.  To me, the sign of GREAT or GOOD company is customer support. By not having adequate replacement parts, it shows a lack of consideration for customers and for people who don't just throw something out when it can and should be repaired. We're looking for another SLOWCOOKER, but I doubt we'll ever purchase a Rival grand product."
2106,5,"Purchased the Chef's Choice Model 610 Electric Slicer based of the reviews.  At first I was hesitant to purchase with so many slicers ranging around $40-$80, though the Chef's Choice is definitely worth the extra money.    All metal base makes for very easy cleaning; both the food carriage and thickness guide plate remove for individual cleaning; the blade, however, is a little tricky to remove (be careful, sharp!), so take care when cleaning.  The grease used for the gears and sliding parts does make a little mess, though wipes clean with some paper towels.  As far as slicing goes, don't let the gentle humming of the motor fool you.  For my first project, I sliced 4 lbs. of cured dried 1/2\\"" thick pieces of beef (biltong, or beef prosciutto).  The blade effortlessly sliced 1mm and 2mm pieces.  My next project was to slice the beef eye-rounds to be used for the cured meat.  I sliced 15 lbs. of raw beef (chilled in the freezer for about an hour and half) in 20mm (~3/4\\"") and 7mm (~1/4\\"") pieces.  As some other reviews stated, the blade tends to create a \\""tail.\\""  This is remedied by some creative handling of the meat:  as soon as the meat pass by the blade, grab the sliced piece by the top end and pull gently as you push the main piece of meat along the full length of the blade.  The slicer has already paid for itself in it's time and effort savings.  Cleaning the slicer included, I am saving more than half the time with better and more consistent results.  Definitely a great buy!"
2107,5,"Bought this for my boss as an Xmas gift, he loved it.  Thought it was very unique and when that wine bottle is suspended in air is really looks like magic.  Well made product, would recommend.."
2108,5,"I recently received my 8\\"" Frying Pan and absolutely LOVE IT!  I was looking to replace my small teflon pan I use mainly to cook scrambled eggs or veggies.  I was a bit skeptical about this pan but WOW, I am so impressed I will be buying another larger size for big meals.  The eggs slide right out of the pan.  No mess, no fuss, and SAFE!  All of the components I was looking for.  The handle is definitely worth mentioning because it's quite sturdy, comfy and made with quality.  If you're thinking of replacing your teflon this is the Gem of Pans."
2109,2,This is beautiful to look at - shiny stainless steel that is obviously very high quality.  However it just doesn't make coffee as good as my previous brushed stainless steel coffee maker - takes for ever to percolate and it doesn't send all the water up through the percolator.
2110,5,"Good quality.  Comes in a neat little box with a sheet in Japanese, and a hand print.  Buy them if you need some chop sticks."
2111,5,"I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it.  Sort of sad because she likes to have her Kitchen Aid on display, but this will keep it from getting dusty or scratched up.  The pocket up front is nice to put some of the extra mixing heads in and it fits nicely.  The fabric seems well made and I think this will last for the lifetime of the mixer"
2112,4,Spray painted them oil rubbed bronze to match all my fixtures.  will be displaying my grandmothers tea cups in my kitchen
2113,4,Bought two to give as Xmas gifts but ending up keeping one for myself.  Gave the other to my brother-in-law who says he's going to glue a picture of his boss' face on it!  X-eyes are a nice touch.  Has a nice weight to it.  Agree with other reviewers who say the toothpicks fall out because the holes are not deep/wide enough.  Beware of breaking the toothpick off when trying to force into the hole. You will never get the broken piece out.  This is what keeps me from giving it five stars.  I guess I will try using an ice pick to make them deeper/bigger because I really like it.
2114,5,"This dish is a nice, large size and the rim stands up enough to make great it for serving a main course that has a gravy or sauce without any mess.  It matches perfectly the other Corningware French white casserole dishes so, if you already have these or plan on getting them, your serving pieces will look coordinated and elegant.  It is a heavy piece which gives it a nice sturdy feel, but the weight does certainly add up when you are serving a main dish that is heavy by itself.<br /><br />There was a huge sticker glued to the platter that was a real pain in the butt to try to get off.  I ended up soaking it in rubbing alcohol to get it all off.  An extended soak in warm, soapy water would probably also do the trick."
2115,5,"I love gravy, but hate the congealed mess that it becomes on the dinner table.  This product did the job at our Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners.  Thanks for the solution to a long time problem.  I think there are other uses, like warm carmel for ice cream in the summer.  Enjoy!"
2116,5,I really like this brand.  It has nice weight for even cooking and is a great value.  It's a keeper for sure.
2117,5,Just adorable & fun to snack from! Each plate is a different design which makes them more appealing. Just the right size & love the shape. Been wanting these for some time & finally received them this Christmas from my oldest daughter. Couldn't be more pleased with them.
2118,5,"Nice look, good quality, great concept. Turn one way get salt and turn other way and get peppers. You can adjust granule size on bottom. You pull top off to replace what  you need. No instructions in box. I would highly recommend this product."
2119,5,This Grater is really good. You can put any kind of cheese in it and it grates it smoothly. Never gets stuck!
2120,5,"Wish I had purchased it sooner. Very well built and the angle is perfect. Some blocks are not angled enough, so it's a problem getting the knives out if you place it on your countertop, under a cabinet."
2121,5,I am very happy that this item arrived ahead of time and in excellent condition.  I look forward to using them over and over again. Thank you very much.
2122,5,"I ordered 2 of these a couple of months ago because they are larger than the 24 oz Contigo bottles I already had. They are easy to clean, durable and a perfect size. I take one to work with me every day. I do recommend letting them dry in a drying rack overnight after washing as they do take a while to completely dry, but they're well worth it. I've had several Contigo products over the last few years and true to the brand, I can throw them in bags (even when they have red herbal tea in them) and not worry that they're going to leak. I also love that they have measurements printed on the side so I can easily tell how much I've drunk/have left."
2123,1,"So you've read good reviews for this as well as the bad, and you're wondering who to believe.  Well, you should buy anything besides this terrible mess maker.  My mother, brother and I all received this coffeemaker for Christmas last year, and much like you are probably thinking: \\""Great! It won't take up too much counter room.\\"" But every time I use it and have to clean up a bunch of spilled coffee, I think that I should go upstairs and write that scathing review.  Today was the last straw.  I didn't even fill up with 4 whole cups of coffee, went away for awhile and came back to the biggest mess I've ever seen.  The coffee had not been brewed all the way (even though it was allowed more than ample time) and when I removed the carafe, more coffee started spilling everywhere. My brother did not even have the patience to deal with it, and just threw it away. My mother hates it and is looking to buy anything else.  Seriously, don't waste your money. It hardly makes enough anyway.  I never write reviews and look how long this one is. I hope I saved consumers out there from the worst coffeemaker ever."
2124,4,Would appreciate it if anyone knows the difference between the Hd 7000 and Hd 8000 models of the My Weight Scale. Much thanks
2125,4,"I gave this only 4 stars because I haven't had it long enough to see how it lasts (my big concern with mixers) but otherwise I would probably have given it 5.    I bought it because my big Cuisinart standing mixer wouldn't fit under my cabinets, and it was too heavy to keep dragging it out from under the counter and putting it on the table when I needed to use it.  I'm keeping the Cuisinart for heavy duty things - bread, for example, or large batches of whipped potatoes, etc. - so I wanted something that I could leave on the counter and would be good for whipping up cakes and cookies, doing meringues, etc.    So far, this is perfect. It's nice looking and fits under average kitchen cabinets. Its low speed is pretty low, it is not super noisy, and it's very stable and stays in place. And the bowl rotates, just the way the one in Mom's kitchen did...  Very nice and I would definitely recommend it."
2126,4,"It is a quality container. It is sturdy, very pretty stainless steel.  Keeps the coffee fresh as advertised.  Compliments the kitchen. I highly recommend it."
2127,5,"I like hamburgers.  Easy to fix and store frozen, ready to throw into a pan or on the grill in no time.  So many ways to prepare them with and without buns, including with gravy and sauteed onions and no bun at all.<br /><br />I've found from experience 90% - 93% hamburger makes lousy hamburgers on the grill, generally speaking.  (Fine for baby meatloafs with gravy and onions though.)  The lack of any usable fat in the lean burger makes a boring and pretty dry piece of meat, unless one mixes in a bunch of spices and what-not into the mix, then makes the patties.  LOTS of extra work that way and dirty bowls needing washing, etc.  Even then, still not a great hamburger though better than just sprinkling a bunch of spices on the outside of the 90% - 93% beef.  I've even done some experimenting with marinating burgers in various concoctions.<br /><br />The best grade for juicy hamburgers on the grill is 84% - 86% burger, but the drawback is that it will shrink about 20% in size and get fatter (taller) as it cooks.  Neither is a big deal.<br /><br />I used to look for the big fat round tubes of 84% burger, get them really cold in the freezer for an hour, then cut the burgers into slices with a good sharp knife, put into individual cheap sandwich bags, then seal in the seal a meal vacuum thing.  Those wide tubes of burger are hard to find and rarely go on sale, making me search for another option.<br /><br />Soooooooo ---- the next best option is to make your own pre-formed burgers for use later, when you run across a good hamburger sale.  With burger getting north of $3 a pound, one wants to stock up when it's on sale.<br /><br />I thought it would be iffy, but I got a hamburger press to make my own preformed burger patties.  It showed up and was built nicer than I thought it would be, and was easily adjustable for thickness.  I chose the 1/2 pound setting on the threaded bolt.  It was perfect.  After grilling with just the tinniest bit of pink down the middle, the width of the now finished burger fit a normal size bun perfectly!  Right to the edge all around.  Little bit tall but no taller than some of the premium burgers I have had at store bought places like Ruby Tuesday or Burgers In Paradise, or wherever they sell those $7 hamburgers.<br /><br />So now, I can catch loose 84% burger commonly on sale in the big loose packages and make my own perfectly formed, ready to freeze and thus use hamburgers.  By my third burger using the press, I had it down, and the making of a burger took me 15 seconds or so each from then on.  By all means USE the special hamburger paper to both make cleanup easier, and two burgers will not stick together if you vacuum seal two or more of them to a pkg for the family.<br /><br />Quick hint..... you will quickly learn to eyeball the loose burger as to about what will fit into the press for the size you have selected.  Then cut the burger into squares with a butter knife, erring on making them TOO BIG rather than too small.  This way when going to the next burger, just scoop up the chunk you sectioned and place it onto the paper in the press.  Place another piece of the treated paper on to the top of the burger and close the press tight.  I leaned on it pretty good, but it was easy.  The press showed no signs of wanting to break.  No coatings flaked off during my use and subsequent cleanup.  If there is too much burger in the press, it simply squishes out around the press where you can easily run your finger around it and place the excess back in the bulk pack of burger to use with the next patty.  IDEALLY you want just a bit of burger to squish out letting you know you got the press full, so it can do it's job correctly.  I put the press on a paper plate to eliminate table clean-up, and that worked perfectly.<br /><br />The whole thing is easy and fast, and it truly does make a excellent formed and cohesive burger in NO time.  Be sure the burger is at cold refrigerator temp before making them, as the directions tell you to do.  Do not let the burger warm up on the counter first, which you shouldn't do anyway.  Cold hamburger makes a better patty.  My finished patties stuck together VERY well into a cogent burger with no signs of wanting to crack in two when picked up.  If yours do want to come apart, then I think you are not pressing on the press with enough pressure and did not load enough burger in the first place.  I did not really intentionally use the little \\""handle\\"" on the press, but rather pushed on the left and right sides of the top half of the press itself to exert more pressure and not break the little handle off, if they were prone to that happening.  You will get the knack of this very quickly, so no worries!!<br /><br />One reviewer thought the press should be a bit heavier and thus less prone to break, and this is probably true.  But I am a large strong guy, and pressed HARD, and so far, nothing broke.irections tell you to do.  Do not let the burger warm up on the counter first, which you shouldn't do anyway.

2128,5,I read the negative reviews on this product but decided to give it a try.  The first time I put too much water in and it leaked out.  The next time I put less water and it worked perfectly.  No leaking.  It makes delicious tea as well.  I recommend this product.
2129,5,"I wanted to buy a gift for my mum while she was visiting us. Found this BPA free containers that were sturdy and looked cool. She loved it, the color, ease of use, and kept her food fresh longer. The price is also very reasonable. Great product. Wish they offered other colors as well."
2130,5,"The product was very nice it arrived quickly, its like brand new. works great! I use it all the time! Definitely a 5 star item"
2131,1,"Perhaps others have had better luck than me, but the first unit that was shipped to me stopped working within 2 months of use.  The replacement unit broke down within 6 months of use.  When it was working, this little convection oven did a fine job.  The cost of this item is $250...so I would expect at least a couple years of use.  I personally would not recommend this unit, but if others have had better luck than me, more power to you."
2132,5,I love having an upright freezer.  This way I don't tend to lose things as easily.  I am able to keep my frozen goods better rotated this way.  I'm not a very tall person so I like not having to dig in the freezer.
2133,3,It took me a few tries to actually get the molds to puff up correctly.  I love these though! Great hit with the halloween party i went to.  It would be nice if they had directions of how much to pour in.
2134,5,"I purchased this travel mug after seeing a positive review about it in Cook's Country. My husband likes to take coffee with him on an hour-long commute. This is the only mug he will use. It retains heat well, is easy to clean, and cools off the coffee just enough through the drinking spout so that it doesn't burn his mouth. Good value and great product."
2135,5,Excellent product! I haven't had any of the heating issues other reviewers have described. Very convenient and i've been impressed with the crockpot recipes i've tried so far! Great investment.
2136,3,"Love the fact that there is no glass pot to clean. REally like the way it dispenses coffee. Unfortunately have had it for about 2yrs now & the power button has broke. Only brews 2cups at a time so I am looking for a new coffee maker.  Not fond of this brand but for the cost & use, it was good while it lasted."
2137,5,"I am not an experienced candy maker. I can follow recipes and temperatures with effort and have just enough skill to not burn what I make. I wanted chocolate frogs for my Halloween party to go with my Harry Potter themed costume, but I had big reservations about tempering chocolate. I bought this cute and realistic mold anyway, and when it arrived I thought,'Wow, this looks cheap, and I probably wasted my money'. Still I had to try it, so I melted white chocolate bark (tinted green with food coloring) from ALDI at 50% for 30 sec increments (about 4-5 min total) in the microwave. Once it was all smooth I used a plastic baggie with the corner cut off to pour the chocolate into the frog mold, and stuck it in the freezer for about half an hour. 5 out of 8 popped out as soon as I flipped the mold, and the other 3 came out very easily. All frogs were solid and intact and stayed that way for hours until they were eaten. My friends were impressed, and so was I. Now I just need more excuses to use this mold."
2138,5,"Update>>>> They refunded me my money with no hassle, but I am going to reorder soon and hope the buzzer will work this time....   This Egg Genie is cute and small much smaller than I though it would be which is good because its not a big bulky thing to deal with lol , I liked it but I am going to have to reorder this because the buzzer did not work. It's suppose to buzzed until you unplug it, but there was never any buzz to alert you that it's done. I gave it a four star because of the buzzer part, over all it's a great lil egg cooker."
2139,5,"When I considered buying these round parchment papers, I thought to myself \\""how silly, just cut the rounds out of a roll of parchment\\""  Well I am so tickled I bought these.  So convenient and really help my cakes look better with no sticking.  I had bought these from a \\""high end\\"" store a few months ago, and these Regencys were just as good if not better & also a much better price.  I keep them in the plastic they come in under my silverware holder in the drawer,  perfect hiding place.  Would highly recommend this product and price from Amazon"
2140,5,I have bought two of these skillets and I love them.  Love love the strainer option.  Love the deep deep sides.  The paint did come off a little on the rim after much cooking but hay its a skillet.  The teflon coating has lasted very well.  Love the plain handle so I can but in oven to continue baking option.
2141,4,"Followed the instructions verbatim and the filter works great.  Water tastes like, well, water.  It does take a good amount of time for the filtration process to run (12 hours thereabouts).  Only major complaint would be the spigot doesn't dispense water very quickly."
2142,5,"the ad showed that it would fit the fen tool. got the order,it does fit the fen. works very good. price is right"
2143,1,"Don't go for this good looking toaster if you mind loud noises!  It has the most annoying beep when you first press the button and then three ear piercing beeps when finished.  So much noise in the house when others are still asleep is just not worth the hassle even if its a KitchenAid model.  What could the engineers have been thinking?  I am returning this back to Macys after two weeks and will buy a normal toaster which does not shatter the peace of my mornings with these loud sounds.    I don't need a jolting beep to tell me when I have started my toaster and three more to tell me my toast is done.  It would be much better if they had a button to tune these sounds off.  Until then, you should tune out this KitchenAid toaster."
2144,4,"After dealing with paper coffee filters for so long, and often choking on coffee grounds, this is a God-send! It is a little annoying to clean, and sometimes you get a chalky residue at the bottom of each pot, but overall this product is great. Definitely would recommend to my friends..."
2145,5,"LOVE THIS!  It's used everywhere!  I chase the dogs with it, I slap the spouse with it...no, just kidding.  Very useful for grilling (think burgers, or fragile things), baking (cookies, cakes, etc).  Really puts all other spatula's to shame - buy this & throw the rest out!"
2146,4,Wok is a beauty itself and i loved cooking in it. Good for usage when it comes to cooking for big family and the non stick is perfect. Somehow i feel it could have been better if the lid was in glass instead of stainless steel.  The finishing on the product was superb as well.
2147,5,"I find this item extremely helpful, when making soups.  Of course plain cheesecloth could be used just the same, but there is an added advantage that this soup sock holds a lot of things (bones, vegetables) that can be easily discarded once the stock is done.  I bought it several times, after I received the fist batch from a friend as a gift. Dolly Tiger Chinitz"
2148,4,"Works just fine, does what it says it will, and I am finding it very useful in my kitchen. I will say it is very light and I did expect something a bit more sturdy. I feel it could break at any moment that would be the only thing I'm not crazy about. I would love it if I felt it wouldn't fly of the counter with one little push or by placing a large or heavy bowl on it was going to break it. It is really small and a bigger weighing surface might have been nicer. For the price its fine and for weighing small portions."
2149,4,"I was happy with the ordering process, and the time it took for shipping and arrival. But was disappointed in the amount of flowers on each lai, I thought there would be more from the way the pictures showed them on line."
2150,5,It was very good quality and did not look cheep like other ones I have seen. The pink color is nice and hot pink. I was very pleased and so was the Bride to be.
2151,1,"This frother worked fabulously for all the twenty or so days it worked, but then it stopped working. The problem was that the plastic attachment connecting the detechable frothing disc to its motor came off and could not be reattched, at least by me. I have contacted the seller, an Amazon affiiliate, but have not so far had a response to my complaint; this included a request for a refund rather than a repair or replacement because the problem seems to me to be faulty design rather durability or careless assembly. Since the gadget cost me, all told, some dollars north of $120, my average cost per frothing - if I don't get my money back - is around $6.00. Even Starbucks is cheaper. Of course I may, eventually get my money back, in which case I will update this review, but even so the psychic cost will have been unreasonably high."
2152,5,I love this coffeemaker so much I've bought them as gifts and a backup for myself out of fear they may be discontinued.  A lot better than the coffeemakers you have to buy pods for as it uses regular grinds.  A fresh cup of coffee within minutes!
2153,4,"Overall I really like this mug - it is the perfect size (not too big) and seems pretty sturdy. The only problem is condensation - the double wall design does not seem to help at all. I have not tried the Starbucks mug, so I'm not sure it that one is any better. I usually just make sure to carry a napkin or tissue to dry off the outside, but I was hoping for less condensation."
2154,5,I have arthritis and I can no longer squeeze on a manual type...This item is great and very easy to clean.
2155,4,"It works great! I did have to push the cherries into the little pitter spot often, they don't just roll in always and the suction comes up sometimes. But it is much better then cutting the seed out."
2156,4,"This is a wonderful conversation piece.  It works as stated, and is really fun to use. Very good to look at as well. Gave it as a gift to a person who collects penguin items and found this to be one of the most unique in the collection."
2157,2,"I purchased my first set from a local store, and they were great.  Very durable, stayed new looking, and I never had any problems--until my father retired and moved in with me.  Since he wasn't working, he stayed up late and would cook snacks after everyone else had gone to bed.  Over time, he ruined the handles on almost every pot in the set.  So I was very happy when I found this exact same set.  I ordered it and a couple of single pots that I needed multiple sizes for (like the 1 quart and 3 quart size).  This set may look the same, but its not.  The pots cook fine.  Heat is distributed across the pot bottom evenly.  The lids all fit well.  But the problem is cleaning the pots.  It doesn't matter whether I scrub the pot in the sink or wash it in the dishwasher, the metal inside the pot retains a white film.  The only way to get rid of the film is to wipe the inside of the pot down with a small amount of oil.  Still, the next time it's washed, the white film appears again.  The second problem is the bottom of the pots.  I like for the pot bottoms to stay clean, so I use Brillo pads on the very bottom when discoloration occurs.  But these pots are stained on the bottom, and I've had them less than a year.  No amount of scrubbing will remove or lessen the discoloration.  The pots look the same as before, but its like the metal material is of a lesser quality than was originally used.  I do not recommend these pots, and I will not buy again."
2158,3,"I was looking for a spice rack that would fit inside my pantry door.  These actually fit the bill VERY nicely.  They have a slide to adjust them, the accommodate many sizes, and they looked nice and orderly when they were installed.  They are basically peel and stick, and it's pretty strong adhesive if you are not going to put them in a place where they will be jiggled a lot.  They stood up for 6 months before beginning to fall off the door and into the floor.  At first I was sticking them back up there; then the tape started tearing.  I'm sure they will still be fine if I want to superglue them to the door.  I don't.  I will edit if I find an alternate solution.  With a more reliable way to mount them, they would be fantastic, especially for the price."
2159,5,"These chopsticks are absolutely beautiful.  The detailed designs have been holding up with regular usage by my teenage son.  Against my instruction my son even put these in the dishwasher and they came out unharmed. These are sturdy and eye pleasing, definitely 4 dollars well spent!"
2160,2,"I purchased this as a gift for my Scotty-fan wife. However, the gold diamond buttons on the jacket on mine were just small dull smudged yellow blobs. Very drab. My wife just put it aside in disappointment. I wish I took a photo of it because, fortunately, I was able repair it using gold enamel spray paint. It now looks like the pictured product. I hope the paint lasts."
2161,4,"These grinders have been absolutely perfect for us. I'm so glad I went with these instead of some of the others out there. The metal bits are solid and the grind is really nice (not too big, not too small). I have people ask where to get them all the time. One of the best buys I've made."
2162,2,The Photo that you show is very deceiving. I could not believe how small is this toaster oven. Very big disappointment
2163,4,I bought this splatter screen because when I fried with my large cast iron skillet my other splatter screen just wouldn't cover the entire pan.  This does that job well.  The only concern i have is at the point where the handle meets the screen doesn't seem strong enough to hold it's weight and I am afraid that at some point it will snap off.  It hasn't happened yet but it is a concern
2164,5,"I have been buying Junket tablets for many years now and they are getting difficult to find.  But, I found these at Amazon.com.    This is a great product for making home made icecream.  I get raves whenever I make it.  Be sure it is the tablets and not the powder.  I modify the receipe a bit to suit my taste.  I put in less sugar, less vanilla, and less cream.  (Put in a bit more milk to compensate)  It turns out great.  Use a lot of salt in the ice to make and keep it cold."
2165,5,"I figured I'd give this scaler a try, but I didn't have high hopes it would work very well. I used it today for the first time and I have to say IT IS WONDERFUL! It works so much nicer than a knife, and so much faster. I'm done with a fish in no time. I put the fish in a bag as I scale it to prevent fish scales from going in all directions. I'm going to buy my parents one of these and I'll recommend it to others as well.<br /><br />[Comment added later, 5-9-12] I noticed somebody saying theirs got rusty. Mine didn't."
2166,5,"I saw Alton Brown use an electric wine bottle opener on \\""Good Eats\\"". I didn't even know they made something like this. I have used many different systems for opening wine from little waiter pocket openers to a stand alone unit built like a can crusher. This thing is heaven! The top is a good, sharp  foil cutter. The opening of the wine and expelling of the cork from the unit was very smooth. It even comes with a nifty wine pourer which has a little rubber stopper with a loop for grasping. It comes with a year warranty so I have little qualms about recommending this with only short time use."
2167,5,"These tops fit all my 750ml and 1L bottles with no problem. They pour just fine and consistently.     I did a quick test and held one of my 750mls upside down for 30 seconds (with the cap closed) and it didn't leak. While I wouldn't trust the caps for long term storage upside down, they will definitely prevent spills.    While they do feel like flimsy plastic, they still seem to be holding up just fine after 3 months of usage. I have these on all my bottles and I will be ordering more."
2168,4,"I ordered one of these to see what it was like and then promptly ordered 6 more!  I store my wine in my 100+ year old basement, way in the back corner on the floor under a shelving unit in cardboard wine boxes.  My basement is more like a root cellar and is about the right temperature, etc.  This product is a godsend!  It fits under the shelves and is all lined up along the wall.  I did not stack them as there is no need for me.  I do have ice wine and those bottles are too small for this rack and slide right out so I jury rigged something else for them.  All the other bottles fit fine and so far I have not had any problems."
2169,5,I gave this machine to my husband for his birthday (hehehehe sneaky huh?) and he has made bread every other day since! He loves it and so does everyone else in the house. I have been experimenting with making jam and he is experimenting making bread. A great combination. It works well and is easy to use and clean. we really like it.
2170,5,"My wife and I like to juice frequently, and occasionally reboot with a good 3-5 day juice fast.  This Breville BJE200XL juicer makes those tasks a whole lot easier.  We've juiced about every kind of fruit and vegetable that you can imagine over the years, with fantastic results; however citrus fruits still juice better with a citrus juicer.  Ever try juicing a sweet potato?  This Breville juicer makes short work of that particular spud.  Mix it with half a cantaloupe and some ginger - and you are in juicing heaven!  We've had the juicer now for more than two years, and have never had an issue.  It cleans really easy, and most of the parts are safe on the top rack of the dishwasher.  Highly recommended!"
2171,5,"What can I say? It's beautiful, and it works. Does an excellent job of reaming the juice out of various sizes of citrus, not just those into which the reamer fits closely."
2172,5,"What a great slow cooker!  I have yet to use the probe but the controls allowing you to set a specific time for cooking as well as the temp can't be beat!  Hamilton Beach really went the extra mile with this must have for any kitchen!  The clips to keep the lid tight during transport and the snap on spoon for serving put it over the top!  One of the best values for the money out there that I could find, and the price from Amazon couldn't be beat!  Love it!"
2173,2,"I bought this so that I could brew my own coffee varieties. I have had it for a little over a year and the pump is shot. It takes 3 tries to brew one cup of coffee. I will use it until it dies completely, then trash it, and NEVER buy another one. I have had a Tassimo for 4 years with no problems! Did I mention that I barely brew 5 cups a month on the Keurig."
2174,5,"All I can say, I had been looking for a new toaster oven for a year...and I felt like Red Riding Hood, some were too big, some were too small and chintzy in quality, I did not want a convection oven which seems to be the trend, and finally selected the Cuisinart TOB 40, and I love it.  It works great, toasts perfectly with it's easy selection dial.  It baked a potato just like my big oven.  This is perfect and I highly recommend it."
2175,1,"The threads colors that make up the orange and green sections of the towel/flag are rather pale. It's not 100% orange-colored thread or 100% green-colored thread; they just used enough colored  thread to visually separate it from the white section of the towel.    Not sure of the thread count, but it appears pretty wimpy.  I doubt these towels will stand up to repeated washing.    I've had bar towels from the source breweries and they were of higher quality, much higher. These appear as barely passible knock-offs."
2176,5,"Other than wishing it came with lid, this pan is great. Used it about a dozen times to make scrambled eggs and the non-stick is wonderful. Plus no possibility of toxic fumes. I even told my Mom to buy one and she can cook!"
2177,5,"I bought these at the local craft store with my 40% off coupon. I looked and looked online but couldn't tell from the pictures what was the best set so I went with this one. It has worked great. I am really happy with it. I'm sure if you are a professional cake decorator you may want something more sophisticated but for me (the average cake decorator, making them on weekends) this works perfectly. It is a sturdy set with almost every tool you will need to create your masterpiece. Easy to clean and they feel good in your hand. I recommend this product highly."
2178,5,"I recently went to a knife skills class taught by Bob Kramer and of course had to go out and purchase whetstones and a 12 in ceramic hone like he had. I purchased this whetstone and a King 1000 Grit whetstone because I didn't think my knives were dull enough to require a 250 grit stone. Now that I have sharpened all of my knives, I think a 250 grit stone would be in order also.     Because I am very new to sharpening my own knives it is hard to review this whetstone too critically. However, I think it is a good stone for a good price which is why I purchased it and it has met my expectations.     I have used this stone after first using a 1000 grit stone exclusively on my kitchen knives which are mostly Shun and a few Henckels."
2179,5,This is an excellent product that creates superb coffee. It is also aesthetically pleasing. The handle is an improvement over the wooden-necked version although one must be very careful not to break the glass.
2180,5,"These cups are terrific! Compact cups nest to save space and include a 2/3 and a 3/4 C measure.  Easy to clean, dishwasher safe, and fun to use."
2181,5,"These mugs are a bit higher than the average mug to buy. but, they are so much more dependable... they will not leak unless the button is pushed. I have careied this mug in my purse, on back seat of my car,, tumped it over, dropped it off table. it has never leaked. come in a great selection of colors. I have bought obne for all my sisters to take to work. They love them too."
2182,5,"The \\""Wusthof Big Game Fixed Blade Hunting Knife\\"" is a high quality knife with great styling and a solid, well balanced feel. The grip is finger notched, which assists both in holding the knife in wet and slippery conditions and in applying force to business end of the knife The blade is made of high carbon steel with a titanium protective coating.<br /><br />The Wusthof comes with basic a leather scabbard for safe keeping and carrying in the field. As other reviewers have noted, the holder is somewhat basic, and has a friction only hold on the knife. I'm not sure I would want to be rolling and tumbling around with this knife on my side with only the friction of the holster to hold it in place.<br /><br />The HC steel blade should make sharpening and getting a razor sharp edge on the blade an easy task. The knife is not just for the field, and may even make a great utility knife in the kitchen for de-boning and trimming. All in all, the \\""Wusthof Big Game Fixed Blade Hunting Knife\\"" is a solid, first rate product."
2183,5,"I researched this coffee maker well because of the \\""mixed\\"" reviews given at Amazon. I decided that for the price it was offered the day I was purchasing, three days ago at the time of this review (it has since dropped $6), the good out-weighed the bad and I had to see for myself what all the discrepancies were about. I don't usually write reviews because I don't have the patience, but I really felt I had to have my say in this one. I was disappointed that it did not come with a paper filter to use immediately, although it did provide coupons to purchase some. It did not come with a water filter pod that it recommends for better tasting coffee. I figured they could have started you off with these two essentials to get started right away. It also recommends using HIGH QUALITY paper filters, so I purchased Bunn's brand. The coffee maker itself is easy to operate and simple to clean. The coffee pot is tall and would not benefit under the counter top, luckily I have the option to keep mine on the island where I have easy access to it without having to pull it out every time I need to make coffee or clean it out. The water reservoir is narrow as others have mentioned; however, it is only a minor detail that barely deserves to be mentioned. I chose to use a Pyrex measuring cup to pour the water in the reservoir, instead of using the well marked holder, because it just seemed easier to me. But I plan to play around and see what works best. Due to all the hype about leakage and since I am the only coffee drinker in the house and prefer my coffee on the stronger side, I chose to brew less than 12 cups. It specifically says not to use more than 1 coffee scoop per cup of coffee, but I believe that is if you are making the full 12 cups, so I knew I could add an extra scoop since I was making less than 12 cups. I encountered no problem with my theory and the coffee brews rather quickly. It's nice that you can dispense it before it finishes if you are in a hurry. Before taking thefirst cup you can easily see how many cups it has made; however, as others have mentioned, after dispensing that first cup you are unable to see how many more remain due to the condensation. This issue is fine for someone like myself, who is the only coffee drinker in the house, since I can easily track the amount of cups I have had throughout the day. It would be an issue for those households/offices who have more than one coffee drinker because you would have no idea when the last cup is taken until you go to dispense it and none comes out. If you don't care about this, it is well worth it's value. I proceeded to brew my coffee without the water filter pod, but used my own filtered water, and it tasted great! I'm not sure what others were doing that complained about the coffee taste, whether they were or were not using the filter pod or filtered water, but if you follow the directions you should not have a problem. I do believe most complaints are due to operator error. The directions also recommend that you run a clean cycle with vinegar once a month. That seems extreme to me as I usually do mine every season. The coffee maker keeps the coffee HOT for for the FULL two hours it claims. I was impressed by this as some were saying it did not. I had a thermal carafe in the past that did not keep it this hot and I had to heat in in the microwave. This dispenser was piping hot after the full two hours. It is so easy to clean afterwards too. Once you clean out the coffee and wash the holder you need to turn it upside down to remove the condensation buildup at the remaining cup marking. I believe this covers a lot of the discrepancies mentioned and I hope you find this review helpful. All in all it is a great coffee maker that makes great coffee at a great price that is very simple to use without any frustration!"
2184,5,"Nice, quality and pretty card.  Lines are far enough apart for easy in writing.  Lines on both front and back which is good.  Looks great with the bamboo box I bought as a gift."
2185,4,"Aesthetics: *****  Durability: ***  Functionality: ***  Accuracy: ****  Value: *****    Pros: This scale is small and attractive, taking up very little room in my crowded kitchen. It serves its purpose and is highly accurate. For its accuracy, the price is unbeatable!     Cons: The scale doesn't seem very durable. It's made of rather cheap-feeling plastic. For the price I paid, though, it will be well worth it if it holds up for two years. I wish the screen had a backlight, as it is sometimes difficult to see the readings. Also, the screen is too close to the weighing area, so large bowls and regularly sized plates obscure viewing.     All-in-all, I'd make this purchase again and recommend it to friends/family who don't want to spring for a $50+ scale. If I had money to burn, I would get something of a little higher quality."
2186,5,"This is my second Chocolate Factory. Got one as a Christmas gift several years ago but in the process of moving and having to store items, pieces got lost. Was so happy to see could get another one. Love using it to make candy and for chocolate sauce for fruit."
2187,4,"I have been using this juicer for a month now, and have enjoyed every minute.  First, the Bigmouth extracts juice very well.  The pulp is almost dry.  Second, it is easy to use.  Third, it is easy to clean up.  The one downside, if you want to call it that, is that it has no container for the juice.  I simply use a 1 quart plastic measuring cup.  I have run virtually every fruit and vegetable through this juicer with great results.  It works very well and is a great value over more expensive juicers.  Highly recommended."
2188,1,"I really liked this machine initially. It did exactly what we wanted. The problem is it's longevity. Mine failed after a year and a half. It simply won't turn on. When I called customer service, they blatantly lied and said there were very few problems with this model. They continued by saying if I had not kept my receipt for the last year and a half they would do nothing. I wish that I had reviewed the commentary here before I purchased it. That being said, I will never purchase anything from cuisinart again. They have lost my business."
2189,5,"I was very happy with the Ninja , it crushes ice perfectly and is very conveinent , there products are sold at walmart too now , very awesome"
2190,4,"Simple storage unit that did what I required... removed coffee capsules from the kitchen work top yet still be easily accessible when I want to make a coffee.  It was a little pricey but to be honest I could not find anything else that beats this unit.  Unlike some reviewers, I have found the sticky Velcro that came with the unit has been strong enough to withstand the weight."
2191,5,"Grinds the beans quickly and with minimal effort. We don't use the feature of grinding the precise amount of beans for a given pot of coffee, so I can't comment on that, but overall it grinds beans quickly and the noise isn't as bad as other cheap grinders I have used. That said, it can be a little difficult to pour the grinds out and requires somewhat frequent cleaning, but any grinder would."
2192,5,"I bought my Dolce Gusto two weeks ago, and I really like it.  I'm a huge fan of iced coffee drinks, so I'm glad that they have Cappuccino Ice.  I'm hoping that they come out with more iced beverages soon.  I've noticed that other coffee machines have A LOT more flavors, and that many other machines can use different brand capsules.  This one you can ONLY use the Nescafe brand capsules.  The only hot drink I've made so far is the mocha, and it was VERY good.  I love the foam it makes on hot drinks!  I made my Dad a hot chocolate a few days ago and he really enjoyed that one too.        I think the value is good, as I was spending over $3.00 per drink, per day and expensive coffee shops.  The drinks that need two capsules for the Dolce Gusto (Milk pod + coffee pod) will only cost a little over $1.00 per drink.  I also think it's pretty fantastic that when you register your Dolce Gusto machine online, you'll get a free box of coffee!  You can also enter the codes online from the inside of your boxes of coffee and earn more coffee or other things!"
2193,5,"These knives are the BEST we have ever owned.  The rivets in the knives help the knife slide through hard meat like dry salami and that's usually a chore.  Well worth the money no doubt about it.  I highly recommend ChicagoCutlery.  We haven't had them long enough to tell you if they stay sharp, but we hand wash them right after using them, so hopefully they will stay sharp for a long time.  And besides all that, they look Gorgeous on the counter!<br /><br />The steak knives slide through steak like butter! They are nicely balanced and feel good in your hands."
2194,1,"If you can spend $350 go to sears and buy a full size oven (space permitting of course) OR go with a much cheaper black and decker model, I had to return this one to warning (that should be their name) as the seal fell off in the first week. The \\""convection\\"" is also a joke. I have learned after 2 purchases a slicer and this item to stay away from WARNING!"
2195,4,"This is a great looking toaster, nice metallic stainless and copper. It is larger than most 2-slice toasters I've seen. The slots are wide enough for bagels and long enough for slices of artisan bread. It seems to toast a little faster than my other ones.  Works for me!"
2196,5,"I haven't found much I can't do with this pan - excellent for \\""one pot\\"" meals like sweet and sour chicken, or pepper steak. With a little Barkeeper's Friend, it cleans up beautifully. At first, it was a little weird never having the stove top set above \\""Medium\\"", but this pan works very well. Feels like it will last a good long time. Definitely in the category of \\""a little more expensive, but worth it in the long run.\\"""
2197,3,"I love spiralized golden beets in a salad, and the occasional radish. This spiralizer is good, but after about 1.5 years it's breaking down. I think a better choice would have been the benringer (Japanese) one, as it has all metal parts. But if you aren't sure you will be spiralizing your veggies for years to come, this one is fine. Also, if you only use it for making zuccini noodles like in raw pasta, you will probably be fine for a few more years."
2198,5,"I have gone through many kitchen timers over the years, because I am sooo clumsy and drop it one too many times, or the timer broke after one drop!  I've never been overly happy with any, and so each time buy a different timer.  I took a chance on this one, and *love* it.  I admit I did not read the instructions, and it is not intuitive, but it did not take long to figure out how to operate the various timers separately.  Even my husband, who has been angered in the past by obtuse timers, was able to quickly use this without repeated instruction from me.  :)  It is slim and sleek; it has both a magnet back and a folding stand that hides flush when not in use.  I have even dropped it!  The battery back came off, but no damage was done to the screen or the electronics!  What a relief!  And I love that the last time is recalled for each timer.  If you need a multi event timer, this one is the best I have seen.  UPDATE....Feb 2012  I have had this for almost a year, and it has been dropped many, many times, and fiddled with by every member of the family.  The tiny batteries do fall out when droped; after searching for those little things and popping them back in, it still works!  It is sad that I am this excited over a timer!"
2199,1,"I received this toaster from Amazon April i, 2011. After working okay for a week, the toaster would shut off  but did not pop-up. I need to use a knife to remove the toast. The handles do not rise even when upward pressure is applied. Calling Hamilton Beach on their Customer Service 1-800-851-8900, is a joke. After all the recorded messages about being told to \\""hold on as a representative will be with you shortly\\"", my first wait was about 20 minutes then I left my telephone because the recording said that I'd be contacted soon. Nothing! I then left my message on their website and would be contacted soon. Nothing! Couple days later I went through the telephone routine and was told I'd be taken care of in six minutes. 25 minutes later I left my phone number again. Nothing! This particular toaster was listed as a good deal on Consumers Reports. HA!"
2200,5,It is a large steel pot. The handles feel solidly connected and the metel is very thick an sturdy.  Not much to say about a pot besides that. I think it was the best quality of steel at that size for the price. I don't really see myself ever needing a different pot for brewing.
2201,2,"The Black & Decker Chopper Plus did not work if you put more than 1/2 the container full of your ingredient. I was not happy with the product.  I have had one for years and it works alot better than this one, but I had lost the blade to it and had to purchase this one."
2202,5,I bought this filter as a gift for my Mother so she did not have to keep buying the paper filters (which are very hard to find in my area). The filter fits perfectly and does the job it was designed to do. It is easy to clean so what more could you ask for. She absolutely loves it.
2203,5,My daughter loves sushi.  We make 'safe' sushi for her to take to school in her Bento box.  It's all part of her 'Japanese' phase. Her French phase was more expensive;)
2204,4,"This product is the best replacement for the original Stain Shield products made with polycarbonate (i.e. containing BPA). Because of that BPA, we finally threw out our ancient Stain Shields (black lid) and bought these.<br /><br />The new plastic container is excellent. BUT the lid is a disaster, as TJ memorably details in his review. In addition to his comments, I would add another lid problem: after microwaving, when you put the heated container aside with the lid loosely on top, the cooling air inside can suck the lid firmly back on, causing the softened rubber to be sucked down into the food, making it hard to remove. BAD design, which could not occur with the old (black rubber) product line.<br /><br />Another thing: the transparent container is BPA-free. But what's in the red rubber? Not BPA, for sure, but who knows what it is."
2205,4,"All of my Norpro brand products are made in the USA; however, this cheese cutter was made in China.  This one is nicely made, but I wish it were heavier/thicker.  It cuts cheese nicely though, so I'm satisfied."
2206,4,This knife is bold with the loud red handle. The blade geometry is similar to Shuns and is very sharp with the added benefit of a harder steel used in the core.  The knife is slightly handle heavy which gives the feel of more control but may be tiring for all day cutting jobs. This is a best of class knife. If you want to save some money and don't need the flash buy the Twin Cermex M66. They have the same core with a plain clad and black handles. One last note these knives are high performance products and when they need sharpening will benefit most by being sharpened by someone who knows what they are doing. I use a EdgePro and have no problem keeping these knives at or above the factory level of sharpness. Avoid motorized sharpeners unless you really know what your doing.
2207,5,Used it for about a month now... No problems may seem a bit flimsy after receiving it... but it does what it has to do... works good
2208,1,"This thing can't even perform its basic function of opening cans. Worked for about 2 months, but the plastic part that holds the cutter in place is - well, made of plastic; really cheap plastic - so one of the little tabs bent out of place, and voila! No more can opener. If you want to impress friends and neighbors with your useless-but-pretty under-counter can opener, then by all means buy this worthless junk. Just be sure to buy a manual can opener as a backup."
2209,5,"I bought this spoon rest to go with the coordinating canister set and utensil crock, all of which are very nice. This spoon rest is enormous, much bigger than expected. It will hold any size utensil (at least, any that I have), and it is nice heavy stoneware. The raised olive leaf and dot motif are beautiful, much nicer than the photo shows. You won't be disappointed!"
2210,1,I have had the machine for a yr now. It jams and you have to keep changing the tension on the same item. The closes repair man is over 150 miles away. Don't buy this machine.
2211,1,Hate this popcorn maker!  The popcorn pops out before it is popped and there is no off / on switch!  Only 1/2 the popcorn you put in gets popped!  Very frustrating!!
2212,5,"Most of my measuring takes place in the morning, pre-coffee.  So I'm grateful for anything that makes the morning easier!  I can tell (even without my reading glasses) just exactly what's in this measuring cup without having to lean over, squint, or hold it up to the light at eye level.  Hallelujah."
2213,3,"Pretty colors, works just fine as a lunch tote. I like that there are two compartments and a tupperware container is included. I'd purchase this again."
2214,5,"I make smoothies with frozen fruit, fresh fruit, juice, and whey protein powder - this blade makes my smoothies so creamy; it has no problem blending the frozen fruit at all. The original Oster blade works fine but doesn't blend like the Milkshake blade - it really makes a difference!"
2215,5,"the thermos stainless king works great for me. it kept my chicken broth hot all day,10 hours anyway, during ice fishing trips where the bottle was sitting in an inch of snow out in the open in 20+ degrees.and by hot i have to wait over 1 minute to sip broth so i don't burn my tongue.the screw cap is neat,you don't unscew it totally to pour your liquid. before use i always add a cup of boiling water to (preheat the bottle) and let it set a few minutes, then empty and fill with your liquid. it cleans easy but you do need a long handle foam brush to get the inside done. a great insulator! A+"
2216,5,"Pasta Server, where have you been all of my life?? It is absolutely great!  Big and sturdy, just awesome."
2217,4,"Let me start off by saying, we LOVE our Tassimo and use it every day.    Having said that, when people tell me they're trying to decide between a Keurig and a Tassimo, I ask them one very simple question.    Do you drink more just coffee and tea? Or do you drink more specialty drinks (like lattes and cappuccinos)?    The very simple reason being, when it comes to variety, Keurig wins hands down. And you can get K-cups EVERYWHERE. Plus, they even have the My K-Cup or whatever it's called, that you can fill with your own favorite coffee or tea and therein have your favorite cup of joe, brewed to perfection in a single serving size.    However, if you just have to have your froth and foam, you are WAY better off with the Tassimo. There's no steaming of the milk or crazy frothing machine you have to buy separately; it does all that for you. There is a fair bit of variety with T-Discs as well, but because of the fact that a Tassimo brews each drink to perfection using a pre-printed bar code found on each and every T-Disc, there is basically no room for anything similar to the Keurig's \\""My K-Cup\\"" type customizable pod/disc. (hence the 4-star rating)    So, if you're into variety, or part of a \\""coffee of the month\\"" club, or just want to try a different coffee or tea every day, or you just *have to have* your particular brand/blend of roast, then you're probably better off with the Keurig.    If however, you are like us, and happy to settle in to the options available (and really, how can you go wrong with a selection of coffee blends including Starbucks, Gevalia and Seattle's Best!) along with several options for teas and hot chocolate, and you find yourself craving a warm frothy cappuccino on a cool morning or even a nice decaf one before bed sometimes, I can guarantee you won't be disappointed. Our friends love having such a \\""specialty\\"" beverage right at their fingertips when they come over, and so do we.    And hey, if all else fails, who says you couldn't have both! ;)"
2218,5,My grandson loves Sponge Bob so when I saw this lunch pail I thought it was worth a try.  I had gotten him a metal one before and it has been well used (many dents later).  I was concerned about the zipper on this but it has not been a problem and he really likes it.  It also goes flat when empty.
2219,5,I was looking for a funnel that would not slip around when I poured a large amount of oil from my deep fryer back into the oil container.  Most funnels slipped or even came out of the bottle and caused the oil to spill all over the place.  I'm happy to say that this funnel did an excellent job.  It stayed put and the filter removed almost all of the particles left over from frying.  It was impossible to find a funnel like this in my local shops.
2220,1,"The contigo autoseal mug's  'autoseal' system engenders a false sense of it's own stability in the user. In my experience it seems extremely robust, but is prone to fail without warning or notice."
2221,5,I have searched high and low for a spoon rest that didnt look cheap and looked right on my stove and these are perfect.Luv them
2222,4,"I really love this little frother - it makes perfect frothed milk for lattes and cappucino every time.  The only downside is that when you froth the maximum amount of milk allowed, it overflows.  Therefore, I froth less milk, but I still love this gadget."
2223,2,"The ties are not quite long or strong enough to organize the bulky computer and kitchen gadget cords that I purchased it for. When I tried to force it to work, it didn't hold and unraveled. Love the look of them, but can only use them to organize smaller things."
2224,5,"A friend at work kept telling me that coffee did not need to be bitter - even strong coffee. I did not believe him until I started using this coffee maker.<br /><br />Although not long, the instructions contain great information about how to make really good coffee.<br /><br />I have had mine for 3-1/2 years, made less than 350 cups of coffee, and it is still in good shape. The quality of the rubber and plastic seems to be excellent and durable. It would be hard to break this thing.<br /><br />It takes about seven minutes to make a cup of coffee:<br />__Start heating water<br />__Measure & grind beans<br />__Put ground beans in tube<br />__Wet grounds - wait a few seconds<br />__Pour in water<br />__Stir for 10 seconds<br />__Wet plunger<br />__Plunge (about 25 seconds)<br />__Cleanup stuff<br /><br />Enjoy."
2225,5,"Love this! Was affordable, came in two days, and we had delicious kase spaetzle for dinner. Very easy to use and clear directions.    Highly recommend."
2226,5,"I like this toaster oven so far.  We have had our one b&d for 16 years, it finally went up in flames;(  I researched for over a week, went to BestBuy, Target, Kmart and Walmart and played with all their machines.  Wow the timer thing is a pain you have to go past 10 and back to make toast, the digital thing would have to reset constantly since we unplug our machine all the time.  I needed an easy way for my 5 year old to make his grilled cheese toast.  Yes my 5 year old.  He has been making himself toast for over 2 years in our old toaster, just a press of a leaver and it pops up when done.  Or turn the switch up \\""in the air\\"" and cook a pizza for our 9 year old and 11 year old.  We never new how long things would cook just if it looked done it was.  I love that this toaster has a knob that goes up in the air to (350) and has 3 settings Bake, Toast, and Broil the last knob is the setting for the toast.  That is it! (so cool) If it is on Toast you can leave it there and they just hit the button \\""Start\\"".  When it is done with its level for toasting it stops on its own!  I have 5 kids and I needed an easier way to cook toasted cheese sammys.  And hitting start was simple and easy.  I guess I will modify this review if the toaster starts to break, but after 16 years with my b&d I am sure this is ok;)  I don't like that I can't open the bottom of it to clean it but I guess the pull out tray is something I will learn to work with, maybe it will be easier than opening the tray over the sink and scrubbing it clean.  So far the easiest toaster oven I have found out there to operate.  It even has a beep when the toast is done:)"
2227,4,"[[ASIN:B000R4LDZ0 Proctor Silex 4-Slice Toaster Oven/Broiler - Black (31955)]]    This machine does all the basics quite well  with little fuss.  I was taken by the rounded design and the front facing crumb tray which is way better than one in the back.  To toast is simplicity itself just turn the color dial to the desired browning and let it do it's job.    I like to melt cheese on toast and the setting for this function , is very easy to do.  You don't  use the broiler, just set the temp to the highest oven temperature and select the darkest toast setting to melt anything.    My one quibble is that the timer sounds like a time-bomb and it's loud."
2228,5,"This item was actually a gift for my mother but I have had the opportunity to use it a couple of times, and it is awesome!!    Now, I know what some of you are thinking, \\""How hard is it to slice an avocado,really?\\""  I know! I thought the same thing before I used this tool. This is a great little tool by Chef'n, that perfectly slices nine thin uniform slices of avocado for you and also cuts it away from the skin as it does so!! How cool is that? Definitely worth a buy if you value thin uniform slices that make a nice presentation or if you are slicing a bunch of avocado for salads and burgers all summer long... zip, zip, zip, All done!!    The only thing I would recommend is, contrary to the instructions, start slicing your avocados from the narrower/smaller end. The handle is quite stiff so this makes it easier on you and it lets the tool do all the work. So basically, you squeeze the handle, insert into the avocado and then drag it through, allowing the handle to open up as you go along. Voila!! Perfect slices. Really nice tool from Chef'n!! I also highly recommend their VeggiChop manual food processor, which I did buy for myself, and is so great to be able to process small amounts without all the noise of an electric."
2229,1,"I gave this 1 star to catch the attention of fellow buyers. The plastic keg in this kit is made with #3 plastic, which is extremely toxic. The beer is pretty good itself and the kit is easy to use. You can ferment the beer in a glass jar or other plastic if you have it available as an alternative to this keg. DO NOT FERMENT THE BEER IN THE PLASTIC KEG IF IT SAYS #3 PLASTIC ON THE BOTTOM."
2230,4,"I've made some of the best coffee ever with this, melita #2 filters, and fresh ground (medium grind) coffee.  Hot-not-boiling water, pour slowly and stir the grounds periodically.    Two things I wish this had:     * a wider base to fit over my favorite coffee mug   * bigger slits for \\""see through\\"" - unless the mug is light-colored, it's not really a useful feature, because it's too dark inside the cup."
2231,4,"This is a huge balloon which cannot be ignored.  It cost about $6 for helium, but stays up for weeks (at least 3.)  You'll have to weight it down with clips so it can move with you indoor air currents.  We kept it almost at ceiling height so the little kids wouldn't grab it or swing it around breaking other things.  If you have older kids/adults you can weight it so that the feet almost touch the floor.  It will move around with the heat or air current from moving people.  Very fun to find it going in and out of rooms unannounced.  Re-inflatable for future seasons.  Gets attention at holiday parties, too. (Holiday hostess gift!)"
2232,5,"This was a  gift to a friend. Someone borrowed hers and then LOST?, it. My friend was surprised and planned to use it for Xmas dinner."

2235,2,"any of the wire spiral design work better.  If the eggs are fresh, one has to shake the whites off the yoke."
2236,1,"This product arrived cracked and broken, and even the intact pieces were shoddy in quality, with very visible seams. We returned it to Amazon."
2237,5,"This bowl is of high quality, very thick glass (fuctional, portable, sturdy).  Perfect for all except the most formal settings."
2238,1,"These knives do not belong to each other.<br /><br />Wooden block itself was made in China. 15 knives were made in Spain (I guess they were made in the same factory that makes cheap Henckels International brand).<br /><br />Only one item from this set (fork) is made in Germany. Scissors have no logo on them, neither country of origin. I am not sure they are from Henckels. Most likely not.<br /><br />It is not a standard set but rather just a random selection of knives packaged in a box with no Henckels logo on it. Knives come from different packages - 15 items were packaged in a white box w/out a logo, and another two items come from a black gift box package.<br /><br />There was no any catalog provided for how these knives are connected to each other. So I guess they are not really connected.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very deceptive way of selling together 18 unrelated items. I would suggest to a serious buyer to look for a real \\""set\\"" of knives all made in Germany and sold together by the brand.<br /><br />And btw, there is no promised \\""Instructional Knife Skills Video\\"". I did not receive any video DVD."
2239,5,"I absolutely love my new mixer.  It has taken a bit of getting used to because of it's size, but it is simple to use."
2240,5,"Easy to use, easy to clean and makes the most even crush I've seen.  It even works well when the cloves aren't peeled.  The construction is robust so it should last forever.  It's expensive but worth it if you frequently use crushed garlic."
2241,1,if you are considering this product you should read the customer complaints at [...] many of these models have been catching fire.
2242,5,To me this is a great product. It works well and I use it almost daily.The only downside so far has been that I had to bend the stir rod slightly to get it to stir the popcorn correctly. I am well pleased with it.
2243,5,"After reading all the previous reviews, I had some reservations but the price is right and with Amazon and the company's 15 month guarantee, I decided to try it.  The upcoming holiday choirs will give it the acid test.<br />After using for several weeks and giving it the kitchen test, the length of the tool is the only<br />drawback, but for me that's easily compensated for.  Cooking for one or two makes it more versatile than my big Cuisinart food processor, and that saves counter real estate.  Changing the tools might be a bit awesome and changeling for some but I didn't have a problem after practicing a few times before putting to actual use.  It does have some plastic parts (gears) but with the 15 mo warranty I have to assume they are of industrial quality materials.<br />I am amazed at the number of blades and how well they perform their respective tasks.  Now on to the holiday cooking.<br />If you like and appreciate quality I think you'll enjoy the feel and using this one.<br /><br />Just one recommendation don't judge it until you've used it a couple times.<br />Jan 13,2011<br />Finding better uses for it ever time used.  Took my big Cuisinart blender off the counter and using the blender tub on this saves lots of counter real estate and a real time saver.  I continue to be impressed.<br />Oct 3, 2011<br />It is a year old now and use it almost every day, with all the attachments I've found many helpful and time-saving uses.  It has held up well not one problem with it's quality of construction and now don't ever think about how much longer it is than other cheaper units.<br />11/16/2013 and it still going just as good as day it was new, I've just about quit using the big counter Cuisinart 6 cup, and have found new ways to use this.  Still a happy camper, this is probably the best service I've had from any kitchen gadget.  You can't have mine, buy your own.<br />I'm sold but now notice they don't show the extra chopping blade and bowl that came with mine.  This sure saves a need for big Cusinart blender, quicker and easier for small cups than that big old unit.  I'm expecting this will last for many years, this will be my last update."
2244,1,"I haven't been able to get a decent cup of coffee out of this machine yet.  It's either too strong or colored water, and no amount of adjustment seems to make a difference.  The coffee is very hot, but I have to wonder if the heat isn't coming from the warming element rather than the actual brew process, because the coffee tastes burned after about a half hour."
2245,5,"I made the mistake of buying my son a regular size coffeemaker in his Freshman year of college; he never used it even though he drinks coffee every morning.    This year I bought him this one cup, ready to go, coffeemaker.   He uses it every day!   The cup is a \\""To-go-cup\\"", so he doesn't have to brew a whole pot of coffee and then transfer the coffee to a cup that he can take out the door with him.       No wasted coffee and convenient to transport."
2246,5,"This is a great product for making mojitos, it is nice and long and has a good grip for really muddling the mint and lime juice together1"
2247,1,"These things are too awkard to use. They sit my shelf, of no use to me. I would not order these again."
2248,1,i purchased this on 9/1/10 and started using on 9/2/10. today is 10/24/10 and it no longer works!!!!<br />pushed the button this morning to have coffee and nothing happened. its very expensive coffee maker and is<br />diffidently not worth one dime. and to top it off amazon of course wont refund since its after the 30 days with<br />no original box or receipt
2249,5,"After many years of home barista-ing and many machines, I wanted a change: I wanted a cleaner counter without knock boxes and grounds everywhere and Cafiza and backflushing and mess. It has exceeded my expectations. I drink a traditional cappuccino. Yes, the foam is the tall style shaving foam, rather than the silky microfoam, but I've learned to live with that, and the Delonghi foams better than my Gaggias, though it takes a bit longer. The steam wand is very easy to clean and does not clog. Setting the machine to the finest grind, and setting it to the highest strength and highest temp, my cappas are perfect -- absolutely delicious. Yes, it's essentially thermoblock and pressurized, but I prefer the cappas' flavor to what I had with a much more expensive setup. The machine holds plenty of beans, and cleans itself superbly every time. It's a design marvel and easy to use. I'm happy I didn't get the model with the milk container, because the steaming is very easy to do myself, and using a thermometer, I can make sure the steamed milk is the temp I want. The main negative for me is that I wish the water container were one inch wider [and hence the machine one inch wider] which would have significantly increased the volume of water it contained:  I find myself refilling the water often, compared to emptying pucks or refilling beans, which is rare.  Overall, I'm very happy I went for this Perfecta."
2250,1,"although a viable concept, these mats will not serve you well. like so many others my experience is the same: they developed splits in less than a year. i sent the required photo under warranty and the claim was denied. i usually wear slippers or am barefoot when cooking. now a year and a half later all four corners on my two mats are curled up and have turned into a constant trip hazard. i should just throw them out, but keep justifying their presence because of the exorbitant price i paid for them"
2251,5,I bought a small ice chest to take with us on our summer outings.  The first time out I realized it leaked as soon as the ice melted.  I bought these as an alternative to real ice cubes.  Works exactly the same with no leaking.  Perfect for small ice chests!
2252,1,"This item appears to be the \\""Del Sol Cold Beverage Dispenser with Lid, 2.75 gallons\\"" which is on sale all over the Internet.<br /><br />It's a simple case of put up a gorgeous pic, make a really cheap crappy product and watch the money roll in.<br /><br />Thanks to online reviews, maybe we can put a stop to these practices.<br /><br />So here's the warning:  I bought two and the result was hours of leaks, hassle and stress. The spigots are plastic (painted to look like metal) and are extremely cheap and poorly made.<br /><br />My complete review is here, which appears to be an identical product: http://www.amazon.com/Beverage-Spigot-Dispenser-Lemonade-Sangria/dp/B002WP9822/ref=pd_bxgy_k_img_b"
2253,2,"Seemed like a great pepper grinder, but then it broke. Bought it maybe 6-8 months ago; for some context on usage, I believe we'd gone through 3 or 4 refills. So not that much; I'd expect it to last longer. The breakage is in the grinding mechanism; it's not like we dropped it or anything. Kind of sad."
2254,1,"I was initially pleased to find these bags offered here after REYNOLDS discontinued them. However my experience reflects that of other posters on the HSN site.  My rough estimate is that approx 50% of the bags I received were defective and would not seal. I'm going back to my FOODSAVER, it's not quite as convenient, but at least it works every time. I doubt there is any such person as \\""DEBBIE MEYER\\"", probably another corporate avatar, but if she does exist, she's a shill and a huckster.  Patrick Monk.RN. SF. Ca."
2255,5,I really ordered this item for my daughter for Xmas. But I have some Lodge cookware that I got from my Mom and Dad when they passed on a number of years ago. Still use it all the time.
2256,1,This mixer failed just after the warranty ended. For the price of this mixer I am very dissapointed in the longevity. It was not used very much even in the 1 1/2 years. I now am going to purchase a non-digital mixer. I would discourage people from purchasing this mixer.
2257,5,"I like the Grand Prix series from Wusthof because the handle fits my hand.  I purchased this knife but what I received was a Grand Prix II, which I do not like.  The description and photo is for the earlier Grand Prix and I thought Cutlery and Beyond must've had some old stock.    I did contact them and they are sending me a return label.  They didn't say there must've been a handling error and would exchange the knife for Grand Prix, so I figured that when you order this you get the Grand Prix II.    The Grand Prix knife itself is great, and that's why I was ordering another.  The weight and balance are superb.  I like the hefty bolster which seems to add strength to the knife instead of just a blade sticking out of a handle.  Also, on knives that do not have such a bolster, my finger, in rare moments, presses into the rear corner of the blade.  Not enough for big damage, but enough to catch my attention.    I like the handle of the Grand Prix over the Classic.  The Classic is flat on the sides, where my hand seems to like the roundness of the Grand Prix.  The Grand Prix II handle has a hump on the top.  For me this causes the blade to angle up some, so I have to awkwardly angle my wrist down.  It also makes rocking the blade somewhat more tedious."
2258,5,love the clean look of the twin select line and no seams make them easy to clean. they maintain an edge and look amazing.
2259,4,This works well enough for me. It helps preserve the wine for at least another day.
2260,5,"The Calphalon Unison Slide Nonstick 12-Inch Covered Omelette Pan was also a great price, since other retailers wanted 150.00.  This even came with the lid for 59.99.  Everything I cook in it comes out perfect, from eggs to fish and even stir fry. It doesn't require much oil either.    I would definitely reccomend this product and I now want more pieces in the Unison line.  Thanks, Amazon"
2261,5,"Given the price, it is good! I have been using it for over a year, and it is functioning well! Only the heating metal is rusted, but it doesn't really matter, our body needs iron anyways."
2262,5,"I just purchased the Cuisinart ICE-21 Frozen Yogurt-Ice Cream & Sorbet Maker and have used it several times. I found the machine very easy to use, the instruction manual is well written and the accompanying recipes are very good.  If you plan to serve more than 4 or 5 people you will need to make several batches of ice cream.  I purchased an extra bowl and find that keeping them in the freezer allows me to make  ice cream on short notice since the bowls are already frozen."
2263,5,Excellent Value.  Super bright and value priced....  Has 2 modes.  Solid construction.
2264,5,"After trying the smaller version I wanted a large one.  You can use this in a pot or in a 12\\"" covered skillet.  A whole bunch of asparagus will fit in it, uncut, if you use the skillet. Works good for steaming dumplings (like dim sum)or anything else you want to steam. And it's soooo easy to clean."
2265,5,I've owned several bundt pans in the past and ended up throwing each away after one or two uses due to the cake not coming out of the pan or just not baking well.<br /><br />This pan is terrific -- worth every penny you pay for it.  It does release the cake well (although I did grease and flour it) as well as bake up high and a perfect golden brown color.<br /><br />Now I plan to buy three more -- one for each of my grown kids.  :)
2266,4,"This seems to be a very well made colander. I am very excited about how little space it takes up. It could even be stored in a drawer, instead of taking up an entire shelf in my cabinet. Not as easy to collapse as I had hoped but not too bad (only reason I am giving it 4 stars). I have the steamer/colander version too (with the long handle) and it is also WONDERFUL!"
2267,5,"I wanted a compact salt/pepper grinder that looked modern.  This exceeded my expectations in every way.  It grinds very nicely, I like how it looks, and it doesn't take up much space on my table.  Perfect!"
2268,4,The picture came as you see it and was printed on nice heavy paper.  I did need to cut off the white edge of the paper to get it down to the size I needed but I counted that as a plus. I got all picture in the picture frame with no white edges.  Is a good product.
2269,5,"Between home and cabin have four of these coffee makers - of various sizes.  Makes great coffee, but don't use cheep coffee in it!  Like full-flavored coffee.  Use HEB !00% Colombian.  Do not like over-roasted coffee ie Starbucks!"
2270,5,"I am so happy with this purchase...it was worth all the research I did.  I refused to clean the George Foreman any longer (what a horror) and so got rid of it.  This grill is a breeze to clean, and the grilling results are perfect for my needs (much better than GF).  Added bonus is it's compact size and reasonable price."
2271,5,"The J8003 Masticating Juicer is excelent. I obtain excelent juices of parsley, cilantro and other vegetables difficult to juice. It is very easy to clean and ensamble. I am delightful with this apparatus. A good exponent of american brands."
2272,3,"I am glad that I bought it on sale, not at the regular price.  Sheets are easily piling after short usage, product does not mean to last; however, they are very cozy."
2273,5,"I purchased my first Sharp R-930AW in 1997 and it was a workhorse.  I especially love the combination feature, since the convection browns food and the microwave cooks things faster.  And, the larger size will handle anything but a turkey.  I wouldn't think of cooking a roast or baked potato in my conventional oven.  When the display window started to get dim and the turntable intermittently failed, the decision to buy another of the same was easy.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that the 2010 model is identical."
2274,5,I live this convection oven. I have always wanted one with convection baking and this unit works great. I have not tried the pizza feature yet. Otherwise it cooks everything else very fast. Would highly recommend and the price is right.
2275,5,"I used to use napkins to take excess water off vegetables.  Then I found this spinner and it works great!  However, I bought the bigger one, which is more of a family size one.  If you want something for just yourself, the small one would probably be a better purchase."
2276,4,"Oven bakes, toasts, and broils very well. Only drawback is the top stainless border on the door gets very hot and is a burn hazard unless the user is very careful.  It should be shielded some how to prevent your hand from touching it when you clasp the handle to open the door."
2277,1,It's a nice looking kettle but it failed in its most important and pretty simple function of whistling only a year after purchase.  It still holds water but it's become dangerous to boil it.    Maybe it can become a watering can.    Waste of money.
2278,4,"On my first use I made a batch of excellent tasting French vanilla ice cream using the recipe in the user's guide that comes with the maker.<br /><br />Be advised that it cost over $6 to make two quarts of ice cream.<br /><br />Recipe calls for 2 1/2 cups half-and-half, 2 1/2 cups whipping cream, 8 egg yolks, cup sugar, 4 tsp. vanilla extract.  (Took about 45 minutes of prep time to make the batter, 8 hours chilling the batter in the fridge, and about 30 minutes of mixing time, and then cleanup time).<br /><br />User guide also advises to set your freezer at the coldest setting when freezing the freeze bowl for 15 hours.  (How much is a kilowatt of electricity?)<br /><br />I'll probably manage to shave some of the cost by getting creative.<br /><br />If you don't mind the premium in cost and time, this maker makes great ice cream.  If I had known the cost involved, I'm not so sure I would have bought this."
2279,1,"We own a WMF Topstar set.<br />One handle broke off a couple of years ago, we contacted WMF and they replaced the casserole right away without asking a single question.<br />The same problem happened again recently (to another casserole in the set) but when we contacted WMF we were told to our surprise that their cookware only carries a 3-year warranty.<br />Apparently they've shorten their warranty because of the bad economy. We have no way to prove the Lifetime Warranty but we're sure the set came with one since it was the main reason we chose their products.<br /><br />Buyer beware: WMF cookware does break and they do not honor the Lifetime Warranty. At least not anymore."
2280,5,"Yes the hot liquids holds for 10 hours or so .Then I tried putting ice cream on it & see if it will hold the firmness  ,I closed the lid & left the mug on a room temperature for 5-6 hours ,Betcha MUG-olly WOW! it's still a bit firm not too soft or anything or almost melting. Highly recommended! NO wonder this mug sells out !"
2281,1,"Well I didn't buy it from amazon, and actually I didn't even buy it, my mother did, and this thing still sucks. We got it to primarily use it to strain the water out from potato shreds for hash browns. The handle bent after the second try and on top of that leaves a big gap that makes it harder to remove the excess water/starch. I wasn't even applying much force when the handle completely bent/broke on me.     For making mashed potatoes this ricer should work but I would go ahead and buy a higher quality item, one that will actually last.    Overall, DON'T BUY!!! There are better ricers out there, go ahead and spend the extra few bucks, you will not regret it, but you will if you purchase this."
2282,1,"Bad bad bad. If grounds spill into the water reservoir, they will clog up and break this coffee maker. It can't be repaired.     It's remarkably easy for you to break this coffee maker:   * Put in the carafe slightly off center (easy to do), then coffee doesn't brew into the carafe, but instead fills up the filter and grounds overflow into the reservoir: Broken coffee maker.    * Put in the filter slightly off center (easy to do), then coffee fills up and grounds overflow into reservoir: Broken coffee maker.   * Set on the carafe's lid without completely snapping it into place (easy to do), then coffee fills up and grounds overflow into the reservoir: Broken coffee maker.     This is my second of the same coffee maker that was destroyed by coffee grounds.     Terrible engineering and terrible product. Buy something else but cheap and usable."
2283,4,"I dreaded using the round, grooved plate with a lid to cook bacon in the microwave. I could cook only 4 or 5 pieces at a time and the plate always became stained brown and no matter how I scrubbed, it never looked clean. And the lid would look bad after a while, too. Storing it took up a fair amount of space as well.<br /><br />This cooker allows you to cook a pound in one fell swoop! So much faster!<br /><br />The only draw back for me--and I don't know if others have experienced this--is that if you like your bacon crispy, it is virtually impossible to get it off the \\""hangers\\"" and unbend it without breaking it. So we eat our bacon bent in half!<br /><br />Other than that, it's totally worth the money. And takes up just a little storage space. Cheapest at Wal-mart."
2284,4,"I purchased this rice cooker about a year ago and have been amazed with the results.  I've used it to prepare brown, wild, long and short grain white rice, and it has perfectly cooked them all.  I also frequently use the timer function to have steel cut oats ready for my breakfast.    I generally avoid non-stick cookware because I like having pans that I know will last me a lifetime, but it is pretty much impossible to find a good quality rice maker, this small, that isn't non-stick.  I went ahead and bought it because I figured at the price I paid it would probably be high quality and last for a long time.  A year later and the nonstick coating (teflon?) started to blister and peel.  Luckily it happened right before the one year warrenty period ended.  I contacted Zojirushi and found them to be very friendly and helpful.  After inspecting the pan I shipped them (at my cost) for physical damage, they replaced it free of charge.  The entire process only took two weeks, so I didn't have to go very long cooking rice by hand.  I'm hopeful that this pan will hold up longer, but Zojirushi does sell replacement pans for about 20 dollars.    Despite the issues with the teflon I would still recommend this product to anyone looking for a small cooker that prepares perfectly cooked rice."
2285,4,"These Sango canisters don't exactly match my Sango dinnerware set but they still do look very nice.  When I got the canisters however, one arrived damaged inside the box and I am unable to reach the manufacturer as instructed for a replacement.  Not sure where else to go to get a single medium-sized canister replaced.  Overall, price was good and shipping was pretty fast too."
2286,2,"I agree with the other negative reviews, namely the display for midgets, too many energy option settings, an almost useless oven light, and clumsy user interface (like try to set the power level to 2). Here is another one: on an ordinary countertop, this oven is so light in weight thanks to the absence of 60 Hz magnetics, that it floats all over the place. Depress the latch to open the door, and the unit slams into the back counter unless it is held with the other hand. Same with depressing any of the front panel switches. I had to install a back board to space it away from the counter's splash guard. This problem could have been avoided by engineering some non-slick feet. Those that it comes with are very hard and slippery."
2287,1,"Like the other reviewers noted the plastic parts that drive the scraper malfunction quickly. I got 3 or 4 uses out of the scoop before the cheap plastic broke. Thing is, the scoop itself feels hefty and sturdy and would be an excellent utensil if they replaced the plastic parts with metal. The scoop stills looks and works fine other than losing the scraper to help free the ice cream from it."
2288,5,"I *highly* recommend this single-serving blender thingy.    I read all of the reviews before I purchased and was a little wary. I was concerned it might not be very powerful and that it would smell of burning oil (as some reviewers mentioned) when I made my first smoothie. Even so, I figured I would give it a shot at $15 because at that price, if it worked at all, it would prob still be worth it for the convenience. Well, turns out I shouldn't have worried at all.    UPS delivered it 20 minutes ago and I am currently enjoying a tasty, healthy smoothie!     It was so fast and easy and effective: I opened the box; plugged it in; threw in some frozen fruit, coconut milk, juice, ground flax seed and wheatgerm; and then pulsed for about off and on for less than 30 seconds, pulled the cup off the base, and...smoothie!     Works like a dream: No burning, no leaky lid, no irregular-sized chunks, no mess, no problems at all. Just blended fruit and other good stuff, all in a cup that I immediately drink from. I will definitely be more likely to make smoothies with this thing because it's so simple and fast and clean-up is a breeze.    I'm guessing people who smell the burning are not pulsing. The button says \\""Pulse\\"" on it--and I'm no engineer--but I'm guessing it does so for a reason. The motor is clearly pretty strong and I can see that if you just held the button down for a while it could over heat. But you don't need to do that. It blends great with repetitive pulsing."
2289,5,"I received this for my bridal shower.  I'd registered for the SCRC500-W but apparently, it's no longer available and this model has replaced it.  I am most certainly very happy with this product.  I made one of my recipes I usually cook on low on the stove top.  I prepared it the night before and then in the morning, put it all into the crock pot and set it on low for 10 hours.  When I got home, it was perfect.  This is the first time I'd ever used a crock pot and I was very happy with the results.  I very much love how once it finishes the cooking time, it will kick down to warm.  It is a nice even heat that worked so well to make my dish so tender.  The crock was extremely easy to clean when I was done.  I'll be using this a lot."
2290,5,"It was either going to be this Panasonic SD-YD250 Bread Maker or a Zojirushi model that was $70.00 more. Based on multiple reviews, I chose the Panasonic. I have nothing negative to say about the Zojirushi. Maybe the few extra programs justify the difference in price. However, after using the Panasonic two or three times a week for the past month, using the receipts both in the provided booklet and other bread cookbooks, I am very satisfied with my choice. It makes great bread, moist, tasty and great texture. I've not experienced a failure yet. This is my second machine. We bought a Wellbilt back in the early Nineties' that produced dry, cylindrical loaves that drove us back to the store. We had heard that machines had improved greatly since then, and when a nephew in England spoke of his fresh bread from his Panasonic machine, we were inspired to try again and glad we did. Perhaps as I gain experience in making bread, I will want a machine with more bells and whistles, but for now, the Panasonic SD-YD250 meets all my needs and more."
2291,5,"I debated over this for a few days.  I decided to get this one and it's 7.5\\"" little brother after reading a lot of poor reviews on the longevity of non-stick.  This pan will pretty much last forever, baring any serious operator errors.      It's expensive, but you should go for it.  This is how I thought of it.  If I buy a cheap non-stick pan every 5 years for the next 50 years, costing $15 each, I'll have dropped $150 in skillets.  (assuming $0 inflation...yeah right)  So from this perspective it was easy to pay for.  ;)      I put this pan through the ringer the first time I used it.  It washed up well, and after using the Magic Eraser on it, it came out perfectly shined and looking brand new.  No problems with it, and no worries about special cooking treatment.  You can use metal, and pretty much beat the heck out of it, and it's fine.  I haven't run it through the dishwasher yet...    because of the handle.  Which is the one wierd thing about this pan.  If you look at the picture, you can see that the handle is at a much steeper angle than a normal pan.  I don't find that it hard to cook with at all.  But that angle makes for fitting it into the dishwasher a bit interesting.      I'm glad I bought this pan, I'm excited that I won't have to be mad about non-stick not sticking to the pan anymore!  :)"
2292,4,"i like it a lot.  no problems so far. had for 1 month. cool blue glow. it starts off by making a loud wooshing sound that we love.  waters ready when it stops and the lever pops back up. fun to see the water droplets from under the clear lid.  However, it is difficult to clean the inside because of protrusions, but i think its easier than most. Also, did doesn't come off for cleaning either.  but all this said, i did a lot of looking and think this is a good choice."
2293,4,"A good rice cooker at a good price!  Stir the rice about 20 minutes into the cooking.  Cleans easily.  Set it, stir the rice once, and forget it!"
2294,3,I have purchased several of these mainly because they can be put in the dishwasher.  I use them for workshops that I have in my home bas ed business. Hot drinks don't stay warm long and when you get near the bottom its easy to spill the drink on yourself.  I notice that my workshop participants take the lids off and just use the cups.  I would not buy more and wish I had purchased fewer of them.
2295,1,"I don't know if I was suppose to do something special with this dish, but I tried it once and it made my dish black.  I was cooking a stew, and it looked like the coating or the pre-seasoning was coming off.  It totally made the stew dark black.  I never used a dish washer, and followed the directions.  This is my first cast-iron pot, so I didn't know what was suppose to happen, I looked on-line and other people have been complaining that the pre-seasoning comes off.  I guess better to get an enameled dutch oven.    I just sent it back, and will try one that is enameled so I hope I don't get the same issues."
2296,5,Better than the regular round cookie sheet for pizza baking. This allows the crust to bake more thoroughly and the crust is nice and crispy.
2297,3,One of my faults is making and eating popcorn with real butter and popcorn salt.  I found this helps get rid of the grease but the power seems a little weak for large kernelled corn.
2298,1,"Unfortunately, this poorly made shaker wouldn't reliably keep its lid on tight.  I checked it before filling it up, but it was obvious the threads were so badly formed that the lid wouldn't stay.  I returned it."
2299,4,"This knife is Excellent. Came out of the Box sharp as a razor. The rubberized handle is great and easy to grip. I looked at several knives including Global, Wustof, and Henckels and I would say these are at least on par with those. Don't let the price fool you these are High Carbon and Stainless Steel Underneath the bonded Titanium coating. The weight is great and I really enjoy the individual wood blocks. Highly Recommend"
2300,5,"This was a great way to keep the kids busy and in one place, they were entertained for quite a while with this. It was even used indoors for a short time with excellent results."
2301,4,I bought this product for my daughter who does a lot of baking and she loves it.  It saves counter space when cooling cookies and that is always a plus in a small kitchen.
2302,5,"Received this as a Christmas gift and am loving it so far. Despite it being freezing out, I have made a drink each morning before work in 2010.  I love frappachinos, but the cost can add up. That said, I don't have much time in the morning and the Starbucks drive thru is attractive. Finding a product that was easy to use and provide me the same tasty beverage has been a dream come true.I can only imagine loving this product more when the weather outside is not bitter cold & snowy.<br /><br />This little gadget is so easy to use (even when you are half asleep first thing in the morning) and the end product tastes great--its is going to save me (and many others) $ and time. I am really impressed with the blending function, as many blenders don't do a good job with icy products....I have not had any ice chunks in my drinks.  Even if the ingredients in the blender are ice heavy, there is a button to do additional blending if you need to. I can't wait to try out some of the alcoholic drinks included in the recipe book next time we host a get together.<br /><br />In terms of the sloppy/messy comments--I really have not had this issue. I make sure that the ice is a little below the ice line on the mixing cup and that way I don't end up with any splash the other reviewers referred to.<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewers that a grinder would be nice, but it is not essential (most grocers or coffee shops have the ability to grind beans on the spot). Because the product does so much else well, it may be unrealistic at this price point.Stainless steel to match our appliances would have been nice, but I think it is attractive as is so not a big deal to me.<br /><br />In terms of the other comments regarding strength of the espresso flavor, I have not found this to be a big issue.  You can vary the strength of the flavor by using different types of coffee (e.g., espresso for stronger coffee flavor, french coffee for deep but not as strong flavor). Brands of coffee can also make a significant difference in taste based on their roasting methods (e.g., Starbucks is known for a more bitter flavor, Caribou for a sweeter taste). I would encourage experimenting to find what suits your flavor needs best. Local coffee shops that roast their own coffee typically allow you to buy small amounts of different beans to sample the different flavors/stengths or hold tastings for you to try them out in the store. They will grind the beans for you on the spot and their staff is usually pretty knowledgable about the different types of coffee beans.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product to all who like Starbucks Frappachinos and similar items.  It is also cute and doesn't take up much counter space.nce in taste based on their roasting methods (e.g., Starbucks is known for a more bitter flavor, Caribou for a sweeter taste).

2303,5,One of the best Pots I've owned. Super thin for cooking rice & jambalaya in. Stinkin wife left spaghetti sauce in it and it ate pin holes throught the sides. Will purchase a new one. No pasta sauce... Only rice next time.
2304,5,"I'm a coffee snob. I spend considerable time making the perfect cup of coffee each day with my French Press. The vacuum-sealed beans are precisely measured, the water is at a specific temperature, the brew is precisely timed, and after pressing, the coffee is poured through a gold filter on its way to the carafe.    Unfortunately, the carafe has been the weakest link (see my review of the Catalina Carafe - [[ASIN:B000ERJ7MQ Catalina Carafes (68oz)]]). If a carafe can't keep coffee hot for over an hour, something is definitely wrong. Even with pre-heating, I couldn't get the Catalina to stay hot.    Last week, I took ownership of a Thermos 34 oz carafe. If one were to compare carafes on price alone, the Catalina wins. If, however, the Thermos is compared on its ability to function as a carafe, it stomps all over any other carafe I've used in years (and makes the Catalina seem like a toy in comparison).    So there I was, French Press to my left, Thermos to my right. I poured my morning brew through my filter and into the carafe. The carafe lid has a very tight fit and screws in tightly. About 2 minutes later, I pushed the spout lever, and was welcomed by a little steam-pop. This carafe appears to be completely airtight.    I brew at 192 degrees, but by the time I pour out the press, the temp is usually mid- to high 180's. When I poured my first cup, the temperature was perfect. A quick check with the thermometer showed about 187).    The real test: what would the temp be like in 60 minutes? With the Catalina, the microwave became a requirement, as the carafe cooled off way too quickly. With the Thermos, I still had piping hot coffee an hour later, and still had a tiny bit of steam-pop when I opened the spout.    I can't really say whether the Thermos keeps coffee hot all day, because my carafe is typically drained within 2-3 hours, However, over a 3-hour span, it's excellent.    Definitely a great carafe. Hopefully the lid seal will hold up over the next year or two."
2305,4,"I was well pleased with this dehydrator, I had previosly owned one and this one outperformed the previous one.   It worked quickly and efficiently and clean up after use was very easy.  I made beef jerky and there was alot of grease from the meat and that cleaned off easily with hot water and dish detergent, no scrubbing required."
2306,1,"I just received this oil drizzler, and wish I had read the previous opinions first.  It is very lightweight, no tight seal and not an MIU product.  I returned it and went to Williams Sonoma to buy the real thing."
2307,1,"I bought this pair of pitchers from Small Appliance and the first one started leaking during the brewing process within the first month. I did not put it in the dishwasher, but always hand washed it. When I contacted Small Appliance (just past the 30 days since it shipped but not 30 days after arrival) to address the situation, they initially balked and told me that since I had had the item for more than 30 days and they couldn't do anything about it. They grudgingly passed it on to a manager who did finally agree to replace it, only I had to mail the item back myself... no pre paid mailing label, their company policy. I know when I have had to deal with Mr. Coffee directly in the past for a similar issue, they were much more cooperative. I plan to avoid purchasing anything from Small Appliance in the future."
2308,5,"This portable pie plate comes in three distinct pieces. The first is the pyrex pie plate that lives up to the Pyrex name in quality and serviceability. The second is an open bottomed ring, forming the bottom of the whole thing. You drop the pie plate into the ring and it is suspended there for transport. Pretty spiffy. The third major piece is the cover. This attaches to the bottom ring without harming the crust of the pie since it is suspended in the center.    We used this pie transport during the Thanksgiving holidays and it worked wonderfully. The construction is sound and everything works as it should. If you need a way to carry your pies to the next family outing or potluck, this is the tool for you!"
2309,1,"Pros:  Looks nice    Cons:  Loud  Very slow steam of water  Only can give out about 16-24 ounces of room/cold water (combined) throughout a day.     If you are a one person household and want to drink only 1 glass of room (which is quite warm), 1 glass of cold and 1 glass of hot water per day, (while you listen to the motor constantly running).... then this is for you.     If you want to drink more than 1 glass of cold water a day find another option."
2310,5,"We have been very satisfied with the purchase of these snow cone cups.  This was the best price we could find, for the quality and quantity   of snow cone cups.  The delivery was fast and efficient."
2311,1,"It looks good and was a good price. BUT brewed coffee is not HOT enough and it is hard to pour into cup, so I returned next day. I haven't receive refund yet. It takes long time to receive it. I don't recommend to buy this product. I bought cheap one for $15, it works much much better."
2312,5,"coffee pot is all it said it was.  Only complaint is the size of the \\""cup\\"" in coffee pot speak - only 6oz! Who drinks a 6oz cup?"
2313,4,"This is a great sharpener.  However, you must follow the directions to correctly hone your knives the first time.  That means twenty passes the first time.  After that, you can pass the knife through the sharpener a couple of times.  I am not a beginner;  I've been in and around the restaurant business for over fifty years and have a collection of knives with both high and low nickel content.  The high nickel content knives (polished/shiny) need to be honed on an electric sharpener;  it just takes too long on a stone and not many people can correctly steel a knife."
2314,5,"Easy to clean, sturdy silicone spoonula. I was getting tired of wood handled spatula heads falling off during mixing and washing, so I got this spoonula, as well as the regular spatula, and the narrow one. Silicone has no seams, so grime doesn't get stuck in creases, and head doesn't fall off. Previous reviewer said the edge of his spoonula is too soft - true, I have a white one which is really flexible, and a yellow one which is stiffer.  I guess quality control needs a little work.  Anyway, I would definitely recommend buying a darker color if you cook with tomatoes or use dark spices. The white one will stain, which can be cleaned with a little bleach; however, I don't know if continual use of bleach damages silicone, so I use the white one for baking only. I've had my spoonulas/spatulas for about 3 years, and they still look new after a quick run through the dishwasher."
2315,4,"The Continental Electric Grill is small and convenient for use in a small kitchen. This is a very basic electric frying pan that works well in a limited capacity.<br /><br />I like that it has fairly deep side walls, so cooking eggs works well (omelets come out nice), and it is the perfect size for making grilled cheese sandwiches. The lid is OK for use while cooking and also helps to keep food warm for serving. I also like that the power cord is about 2.5' long, which is a fair length for counter-top cooking.<br /><br />There are few basic things that keep this from being really good. The first is that the non-stick coating is VERY thin, so it really needs to be hand washed shortly after using it. The heating control is far from precise and needs to be watched very closely to avoid burning the food until you become familiar with it. Lastly, the handle is detachable and the pan can be used to serve the food, but this should be attempted with utmost caution when hot.<br /><br />This worked as expected, but my expectations were fairly low. I would buy it again.<br /><br />CFH"
2316,5,This is the fourth one I have bought! Not because they break - because they work so well and are so easy to use and clean that I buy them for gifts. It has replaced my blender and food processor for many tasks. It is -simply the best! Oh and those who were on the receiving end of the gift loved this product too.
2317,5,"I purchased this item to grind nuts, seeds, & spices. It works great. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a quality 200 watt grinder. I choose the stainless steel one because the inside is all stainless steel. Didn't want to stain the white plastic inside of the cheaper model."
2318,5,[...].  Perfect size for what I needed and the price was great too!  Had to have stainless steel with a flat bottom to use on my new ceramic cooking top.  Old pot didn't make contact for proper heat transfer.
2319,2,"I have had this food processor for a few years now and am not at all impressed.  I wish I would have chosen a different one.      Problems:    1.  I also had the problem where the small piece that holds the discs on got stuck.  Kitchenaid had great customer service and replaced my unit.  If that were all, I'd be happy.    2.  I bought this unit because I liked the versatility of bowl size, however every time I have tried to use the smaller bowls, they have leaked into the larger bowl causing me more dishes to wash.  I just quit using the smaller bowls.      3.  As another poster said, the larger opening is great to allow a wide item to fit, but you have to make is short for the pusher to connect to the lid and turn the machine on so I find I don't use the large opening very often. It is easier to just cut the items to fit in the smaller opening.    The actual processor does cut great, but it is big and bulky for small jobs and not as versatile as I had hoped.  I don't always want to use a 12 cup bowl, but I don't want to clean 2 bowls either."
2320,5,"This is a well-designed product that works perfectly!  I use it on my bus commute to work each day for coffee and it keeps it hot to the last drop, even after 3 hours.  The shape is just right to hold comfortably, and it fits in the cup holder in my car.  The larger 16 oz is better that the dinky 12oz versions on the market.  The lid, as well as the sipping hole, both make a perfect seal so there is never a spill or splash.  The button to open the siping hole is loaded with enough spring pressure that it isn't prone to accidently opening, even when I throw it in my backpack sideways with my other gear. Construction quality is very good and I expect many years of reliable service."
2321,4,"Bought this coffee grinder to grind spices, works really well.  Is nice that the cord wraps up inside it, too many gadgets have the cord sticking out while being stored.  We've only used it once, and it did a good job, but I don't have any input about durability over time yet.    Would buy again."
2322,1,A real piece of Cheap Chinese Crap. Worked only 7 months - then the control knob broke off. This knob control both the power (on/off) and the steam valve (diverts steam to the latte steamer nozzle OR to the brewer). The plastic knob stem broke where it was attached to the steam valve - this should have been a metal part - not plastic. Another piece of landfill due to poor engineering. I suggest you avoid any Sunbeam (aka Mr. Coffee) products.
2323,5,"Item says orange,don't remember it saying orange when I ordered but I got blue which is perfectly fine. Nice big size ."
2324,4,Product will neatly hold rectangular containers.  It is a flashy bag of which I have received many complements.
2325,4,This made the perfect gift for teachers and such. I filled them with chocolates and they were received very well. They are so pretty.
2326,5,"I love the classic because it is good looking and it works well.  It doesn't leak and the top doesn't fall off if it is put on right. Match arrow, arrow to arrow.  When you pour and your fingers are on the handle it is very easy to rest your thumb on the arrows on the handle/cover, offers security and a nice method of handling the pitcher.    This is a two-stage pitcher, I use it for coffee and tea and cooking.    I use a Pur three-stage pitcher for drinking water.    For looks and handling, I think the Classic Brita has it all over the Pur but have learned to live with wanting the three-stage process for some things, wish that Brita would consider a three stage filtering system."
2327,5,"I'm a popcorn addict, and I've tried several different methods, but this is my favorite.  You need to buy popcorn that is fresh so that it comes out nice and crunchy (Whole Food's bulk popcorn is pretty good).  You need to use oil to make popcorn in this pan, but you don't need as much butter because the oil gives it a nice flavor.  The vent holes release steam which is what makes the popcorn come out nice and crispy.  I pop a couple of batches and salt it (no butter) and put it in a large tupperware container, and my husband takes it to work to have for his afternoon snack during the week and it stays fresh for the whole week.  He doesn't miss the butter, but when we're at home, we add butter, of course!"
2328,4,"We have used the cover for more than one year. It is covering a wood and tile kitchen table and cat's jump up on it when we are not around.  This cover protects the table from their accidental scratches. With the cover, we have no cat hair and no scratched wood surfaces. Plus everyone that sees it thinks it is a real tile table cover, until they touch it.  We did not buy it for decorative purposes but people do compliment the look."
2329,5,"Don't waste your money on a spice rack full with spices. Half of the included spices are garbage.  Just buy this and fill it with what you need as the days go by.  Very good quality, mounts easily, and holds all my McCormick spices jars and a few others.  My wife loves it too.  I have 17 spices on it, and it's full."
2330,5,"This is an excellent grinder, very little static electricity, but on fine grinds it needs to be cleaned frequently.  I replaced another Capresso after about 14 years of service.  I'm quite pleased with this one.  The timer  is pretty accurate for the number of cups you want to grind and it seems sturdier than the one I replaced.  I expect it to last."
2331,4,"This is a great corkscrew and probably the easiest one I have ever used!  This would clearly be a five star product if the design held the pieces together better in the drawer, in transit, etc.  However, that is merely a convenience issue.  The corkscrew works easily and is all I had hoped for in purchasing it."
2332,4,I purchased this as part of a wedding gift.  Item arrived timely and was in good condition.
2333,5,This Bread knife cuts through French breads cleanly and doen't crush the soft insides of the slices. A bargain at the price. The materals are first quality.
2334,1,"We have always been big Saeco fans - had their machines for many many years and got a lot of our friends turned on to the brand. So we finally decided it was time to get their latest and greatest - the Talea Ring Plus.  Oh my goodness! I can't believe how poorly this has been. The Espresso is quite good and I like the adjustments and controls. But frothing milk is a catastrophe! It usually will not create an froth, just hot milk. No matter whether you use the cappucchinatore or island. And the island tends to leak or come loose... Should you ever drop the glass carafe of the milk island, you will be surprised how much a replacement is. After a few months, the machine started to leak and now we got a taste of Saeco's so-called customer service. It was the worst experience ever, period. After many weeks of phone calls (I am not making this up!) we finally got authorization to send it in. The returned it very quickly (impressive) and now the leaking seems fixed for the moment but still no froth! It is ridiculous - any cheap, older Saeco (i.e. Vienna) used to do this great!   If this has not scared you enough, please do a Google search for it - you will find tons of bad reviews and disgruntled owners. Wish I had done that!  I would so not ever buy another Saeco - I feel I got screwed for my $1,500. Next stop - Jura."
2335,4,I love these little pods.  I bought a couple more sets after trying them the first time so that I can make 6 at a time.  They are so easy and quick and the eggs come out perfect everytime.  I had company and was able to make a lot of eggs and hold them warm in the 175 degree oven for almost a half an hour and they were wonderfully shaped and delicious.
2336,5,"I changed to the flexible cutting mats when they first came out and never use the others, ever. These are so easy to just pull out, little space needed, sanitary, fold for spout to pour in bowl.  I can use one for cutting veggies, use another to cut meats, another for making pies or cookies...then just rinse and put in top of dishwasher in just a few seconds. I still am using my first set from years ago.  No more wooden cutting boards for me."
2337,5,"These knives and case are great.  And it got me a big \\""atta boy\\"" from my wife."
2338,4,"Really enjoy useing the George Forman 360. Does a good job and is very handy for most every thing. I do think the cord should be longer, since I had to buy an extension cord so I can use it where I need to. It is really easy to clean."
2339,5,"This is a great product, thus far. I searched high and low for a corkscrew that doesn't require any hand strength (it was a present for my 70+ year old father) and this was the only one that fit the bill. So far very pleased."
2340,4,Works well once you practice. Read the manual and use a cheap knife to learn.
2341,5,"A fantastic fry pan.  A little bit more pricey then the average \\""in store\\"" pan but well worth it.  With its heavy, solid build and even heating I recommend this for any serious household chef"
2342,5,"I received this as a gift about a month ago and I absolutely love it.  Every morning for years I make essentially an Egg McMuffin (english muffins, cheese, canadian bacon, egg).  EVERY morning for years I would leave a dirty skillet in the sink to wash when I got home.  With this nice kitchen gadget I prepare the same breakfast sandwich in less than half the time, also it took me two eggs with the skillet method, this just takes one and its all nice, and perfect to fit the muffin bottom.     The directions state to spray the egg pan with cooking spray before each use, which I do, and the egg just pops right out on my english muffin after it's cooked thoroughly.  I have found no faults with it and the cord even wraps up around the bottom so that you can store it with out have a wild cord running around your shelves."
2343,3,"i just received 5 sets of these (for my birthday)- as we are collecting Settings for 20 people in order to have the family together for christmas 2009. - these arrived fine. - are beautiful. i am almost afraid to use them. - i just might give the children (by christmas the 3 youngest will be 10 and 11) these to use as well, kids will be kids --<br />i love the design, and still have more of the winterberry collection to get, - :)) thanks Pfaltzgraff!"
2344,4,"If you want to toast bread, use a toaster. The crumbs from any cooking can accumulate on the oven bottom and make it hard to clean. Not worth the effort for a few toasted slices. You could always use the baking pan but then it won't heat evenly. So it's basically a small oven.   This oven does the job and maybe even does it too well. Maybe since the oven is new that my food was overcooked even after following proper cooking times. Because of this, you should probably knock down an extra minute or so from the cooking. After some tinkering, the controls are also extremely easy to use.   The problems that arise are:   1. Cleaning this thing is problematic. If crumbs or food particles fall to the bottom, you'll have to wait until the temperature cools off and then try wiping it off. If you use the cooking pan then it'll take longer to cook and you might as well use some other heating application for toast or anything small.   2. This cooking space itself is quite small compared to the overall contraption. Don't expect to cook anything too large or else the top portion would cook faster."
2345,4,"OK, so if it was used more than ocassionally, it would get five stars.  Put this in the \\""someone had to think of it\\"" category.  Solid as other Good Grips products and purpose-built to do just one thing - pit a mango.  If you have a mango-lover in the house, surprise them with this unique tool, as I did."
2346,2,"As noted by other reviewers, these warp badly -- pretty much anything over 350 degrees, and even 350 is dicey. Not necessarily a problem if you are only using for cookies, but not useful for anything else!<br /><br />One (better) alternative is Chicago Metallic professional-grade large jelly roll pans -- available on Amazon, but also from Chef's Catalog (2 for $30) and at World Market (Cost Plus) stores. Costco also used to have a set of 3-4 professional-weight cookie/jelly roll pans even cheaper, so keep an eye out for those!"
2347,2,"I bought this toaster last year. I really haven't been happy. It takes too long to heat. My son jacks up the setting, then pops the toast early to get the toast to toast. I love kitchenaid, but not this one."
2348,5,"I own All Clad, Cuisinart and Le Creuset and LOVE this non-stick.  I also have a bunch of Calphalon, and am gradually moving to the all non-stick arena.  LOVE."
2349,5,"Shun. What more needs to be said??? It is simple, Shun is the best all around. Will you pay more? Sure you will but you will never have to buy a replacement in your lifetime. Shun knives are the best in the world, no question."
2350,5,"First, get one of these beautiful cruets for yourself, then check your gift list.  It's a winner, and everyone who has seen it wants one, too!  In my well-supplied kitchen, this is my treasured toy of the moment and earned an instant, permanent place on the kitchen counter.  It is beautiful, balanced and truly dripless.  The fine design, reminiscent of a perfume bottle, allows very controlled dispensing for the perfect olive oil drizzle without overpouring.  The globe fits in the palm of your hand and the top does not fall out when held upside down. This leaves your other hand free.  It is indispensible in general and appreciated when I am baking bread and need a few quick drops of oil with messy hands.  It is beautiful enough to be art and practical enough for solid every day use.  The design is brilliant. I find it helpful to reduce butter use even further to enjoy olive oil drizzled on grilled bread."
2351,2,"If all you want to do is make drinks to pour over ice the machine is great.  However, if you plan to make any frozen drinks, which is what I purchased it for, you might as well forget it.  It barely makes a chip in the ice when blending.  I'm extremely disappointed."
2352,4,"I have needed this for a long time. We deep fry in a dutch oven and have always had a problem getting hot food out of the pot. This is a perfect size (5\\"") and stainless steel and allows me to get a lot of food out in a hurry."
2353,2,"We have put up with this griddle for at least a year. It's fine except that the heat is uneven. The end of the griddle closest to the plug-in is much cooler than the rest, so those pancakes are still gooey while the rest are ready, so you end up \\""babysitting\\"" your pancakes (taking some off, adding batter, then taking the slow ones off, etc.)when you should be eating. We just sent it off with our son to college, so we get to buy a new one!"
2354,4,"Yes, this line of Henckels knives is not made in Germany, but in China.  (And yes, I also think it is somewhat confusing and irritating at times to see information that suggests products are from one place when they are actually from another.  But that is a problem with many of the products sold now.)  But, made in China or not, these knives seem rather nice to me, not anything like the quite inexpensive ones that might also be made in China under other brand names.      The blades do not have that too flexible quality that comes from steel stamped too thin.  The blade and handle is one piece, so there is no danger of the latter coming off.  (Furthermore, there will not be that problem with wooden-handled knives that stay wet just a bit too long after being washed: a rather musty smell.)  There is a good mix of types of knieves, though the chef knife has a blade that is a bit narrow (in that it is closer to a carving knife in size than usual).  Also, the sharpening tool has a plastic handle, which is aesthetically and practically rather unfortunate, given that everything else is steel.      Finally, the only real issue I have with the set is that the angle of the storage block is such that when placing it on top of a counter that has cabinets hanging over it (something that I think a lot of people do), the knives cannot be removed.  You have to move the entire base out so that you have enough room to pull the knife up without hitting the underside of the cabinet.  The old block of knives we had was built with a better angle, which did not cause this problem.  Still, overall it is a nice set."
2355,5,"This was purchased for use in our church. We already had a larger urn, but needed one that wasn't so large for a different function, so as not to waste unneeded coffee. This was purchased both for it's in-between size and because it is stainless steel, not aluminum. Aluminum can leach into liquids and is detrimental to your health. So now, both of our church's coffee urns are stainless. We like this unit, and it has been performing quite well! I give it a 5-star."
2356,5,I loved it!!! It's great for when you are cooking for a big family.  It cleans good and it's great for pasta.
2357,3,"Could not find sunflower cocktail napkins anywhere and google led me to a website where they could be ordered from Amazon. I got quick service, and they were just what I needed. Mindy Orman Nashville Tn."
2358,5,"I call this pot my wonderful pot simply because it is.  It is heavy and it fits flat on the element, since I have a ceramic cooktop, this is very important.  I have used Revere with  copper bottoms all my married life, but now I plan to use Revere Traditions.  I love it and would recommend it to everybody who is looking for a nice pot for cooking."
2359,5,"Read reviews on this and went with opinions. Grinder works fast, relatively quietly and has the many grind variations I wanted. Great product!"
2360,4,"Like the look of this garland.  Wish it was a little longer, but it still works fine.  The piece spreads out nicely and holds the shape you desire since it is wire."
2361,2,"I use this cup for making salad dressing. I make enough for a couple of nights and like to put the rest in the refrig. I had been covering my cup with saran, so I jumped at this cup with lid. Problem is, it does not seal. There is a big gap between the spout and the lid. So, the dressing dries out or the dressing (if garlic/onion/shallot) smell permeates through the refrig. It does not seal so liquids will leak out of the spout. It would be good for pouring off liquids from, say, micro'd veggies.   The other irritating thing is, I have 2 other PYREX 2-cup measuring cups (I bought this 3rd cup bec of the lid), and the lid doesn't fit them."
2362,5,This is a fabulous product.  I have a bunch of All-Clad and you just can't lose by buying their cookware.    It pays to buy the best you can because it will last forever.
2363,2,I REALLY LIKE THIS ICE TEA MAKER....SO MUCH I BOUGHT ONE FOR A GIFT AND SHE LIKES IT TOO!
2364,5,"We love iced tea and make it all year round.  The Mr. Coffee machine for this we had before was a constant problem.  When the pitcher finally cracked on us, we could not seem to find a replacement, even from their website, so we decided to buy an entirely new unit.  I read the positive reviews about the Hamilton Beach machine on Amazon and decided to purchase one.  So far, my husband and I are delighted with the quality and the ease of use of this machine.  I highly recommend it!"
2365,2,"I have gone through many grill pans, both expensive and lower priced, trying to find one that will keep it's non-stick capabilities at high temperatures.  This one worked great the first four times that I used it, then the honeymoon was over and food starting sticking to it. Even after soaking it, it is difficult to clean. Perhaps if I lowered the temperature it would work better and food would not stick, but to me the purpose of a grill pan is to be able to sear my chicken not saute it.  This pan is a disappointment.  Martha Stewart should be ashamed."
2366,5,"I never ate so much rice before! I make at least 2 cups for my daughter and me every day. Previously I thought the microwave rice maker I had was great and made fine rice, but this is great. I usually make the medium grain (sticky) rice and it is wonderful.  Much easier to clean than the microwave maker and much easier to use because there is no guessing. Just use the cup to measure the rice, rinse the rice (I  think it tastes better), put in water up to the line and turn it on.  Sometimes I do it the night before and set the timer or set it when I leave in the morning to be ready when I get home at night.  It's so nice to come home and have delicious rice all ready.  It's so easy then to just grill something or use the microwave to make some vegetables.My oatmeal didn't come out because it boiled over, but I've since read to add a little butter which will keep that from happening.  At least this rice cooker was easy to clean up from  the boiled over oatmeal mess.  I love the thick titanium bowl and think it's much healthier  to cook rice in this than in the plastic microwave cooker.  It's a real luxery to have this and may be a little hard to justify the cost, but since I'm starting the Rice Solution Diet, I'm thinking I can justify it if I keep losing weight.  Five pounds down so far!"
2367,5,Super cute timer! Works great.  I think the people that complained about the timer not working didnt follow the timer setting instructions provided in the packaging. :)
2368,5,This is not a fancy product and it doesn't claim to be. It just makes good coffee. I have had none of the problems with leakage that others have written about. It is easy to set up. The timer works well and I like the automatic cutoff. Because of the metal in its construction it is heavier than som other coffee makers. This might be an issue if you have to slide it out from under a cabinet to pour water into the tank. I would recommend this product to anyone.
2369,2,"I bought this toaster because I had had a similar Phillips toaster with long slots, and this looked similar, and it was nice in stainless steel to match my other appliances. It is terrible!! you have to rotate once or twice your toasts to get them almost even, it burns the edges and does not toast the middle... DO NOT BUY IT."
2370,3,"I found that the product as shipped was not usable.  Even with the largest grind available on my solis maesrto, it would not drip down anywhere fast enough.  It seemed to stall about 3/4s of the way down.  I solved this problem by drilling four more holes adjacent to the one supplied.  Now it works fine."
2371,1,i bought this with my pod coffee maker thinking i would save money on making my own pods with regular coffee. well let me tell you. the thing worked for maybe a month. then it just stoped. i was not very happy. what a piece of crap. just go and buy the pods in the stores or online. the flavors are so much better.
2372,5,I have never used a Kitchen Aid Mixer in my life.  I read the booklet that came with the mixer and used my own recipe to make banana bread this past weekend.  I just don't know how I have gotten along without a Kitchen Aid Mixer for this long in my life.  And more amazing to me is that my Mom never had a Kitchen Aid Mixer.  I JUST LOVE IT!!!
2373,2,"Before purchasing this poster, you should know that it's the Challenger space shuttle that has been photographed.  Even if you click on the picture, you can't read it, but we could see it listed right there on the space shuttle when we received it.    I don't think we would have purchased this poster for my son's room had we known that it was a photo of a space shuttle in which astronauts eventually died.     This poster should have been identified with the name in the description."
2374,5,"Have been using these for a few years.  They work every time, never had a problem."
2375,5,"I love this Wok i've had seviral Woks over time and this has surpassed them all in quality and workmanship.. And i like it that's it's made in USA.. I hate buyin cheap products for the sake of it being cheap..I'm a strict Ovo-Vegetarian,& it makes great scrambled eggs.. rated 5***** fer me"
2376,1,My rating is LESS THAN A ONE. I have purchased lights from this company several times and found I have only wasted my money. The lights burned out long BEFORE the holiday season ended and the company will only make excuses.  I will never buy anything by Everstar again
2377,2,"Agree with some of the other reviewers. Best not to use with mixed drinks, for example, coffee or tea with milk or cream, otherwise, particulate material gets trapped in lid (breeding-ground for bacteria). I almost threw up at work with my first morning sip. I had been sure I had cleaned and rinsed out the top the night before.<br />After work, I tried many times to clean the top out. Despite hot water & soap regimen (similar to prior posts), followed by multiple (>15X!) rinsings with vigorous shaking, I could not clean it completely-brown flaky crud would still come out (saw when rinsing into white bowl)-very gross! Finally, I gave up and \\""sacrificed\\"" the top and opened up the inner mechanism (by cutting the stem). Design flaw led to retained material in central chamber with foul-smelling, encrusted, rusty metal spring-coil. Oxo needs another seal, to prevent liquids from coming into the central chamber. I loved this mug, until I realized it was too difficult to clean. I was trying to be \\""green\\"" by bringing own mug to work. I use the bottom still, but for bringing liquids (with milk) to work, I will go back to my Nissan thermos, until can find a better mug design, that's non-spilling, safe and easy to clean. I'm going to warn my friends who have not had their mugs as long..."
2378,4,"There's really not much to say -- this is just a simple, reversible aluminum wok ring. It does what it's supposed to just fine on both gas and electric ranges. It's big enough even when inverted to fit over the large burners on most stoves."
2379,5,Love it!  It is pretty to look at and even prettier to clean.  Never have had a problem cleaning it.  Cooks fast and evenly.  I would love to have one in every size and color (need to win the lottery first).  You won't regret this purchase!
2380,5,"I love them!  It is so nice to not have to saw through food with a dull knife.  I have seen infomercials for years and didn't quite believe them.  But I have been looking at knife sets for some time and couldn't find anything I liked.  I saw these on Amazon on sale and thought, what the heck, for that price I'll give them a try and am I ever glad I did."
2381,1,"This product is a nice idea but designed and executed poorly.  You would be far better off buying a regular cast iron skillet and \\""season\\"" it.  I bought this pan thinking that the inner ceramic finish would make it a breeze to cook with.  In fact, the \\""Use and Care\\"" instructions that come with the pan make no mention of it needing any seasoning.  The only recommendation was to use a little oil to prevent sticking.  Don't get me wrong; I love my Lodge Dutch ovens.  The quality of the ceramic finish on the inside and outside of the Dutch ovens is extremely smooth and provides a very stick-resistant surface.  That's how I was suckered into buying this pan. Boy was I in for a surprise. The food surface finish is very rough.  In fact, it looks exactly like one of their \\""pre-seasoned\\"" regular cast iron surfaces, maybe even rougher.  The first time I tried to fry some eggs in it (and they were literally floating in oil) the eggs stuck down so badly that I had to rip and scrape them out of the pan.  So now I have an expensive, yet worthless frying pan that I have to be really careful about putting into water when it's hot and dare not put over a strong flame (such as a campfire) that has a \\""ceramic finish\\"" on the cooking surface that is way, way, way, worse than a properly seasoned regular cast iron pan.  No thanks.  Sometimes you win by buying the cheaper brand (Lodge Dutch oven vs. Le Creuset) sometimes you get stung."
2382,1,"I would give this product zero stars if I could.    For those who are not familiar with the original U.S.-made glass/ceramic Corning Ware, this cheaply made substitute may seem like a good deal.  For those of us who still have pieces of the original Corning Ware, this product is a horrible substitute.    World Kitchen bought the brand in the late 1990's, promptly \\""redesigned\\"" the product, and shipped manufacturing overseas.  WK is trading on the reputation of Corning Ware while offering a product that bears no resemblance to the original in versatility or durability.     I'm switching over to Pyrex.  It is an excellent product and manufacturing is still done in the U.S."
2383,5,This waffle maker works really well. It make thick waffles and stores with great ease as it folds and stores standing up. This is a great space saving feature. I am enjoying using it. I followed the recommendation that you prepare the surface for the first use and there was no sticking even when I used the last of the batter. I would recommend it especially if you are short on space.
2384,5,This sphere is simply beautiful. I hung it in my bedroom window and I simply adore the rainbow colors this sphere produces. Magical!
2385,5,Had been looking for a coupon holder for some time so was really excited to find it on line with Amazon.  Was as good or more than I had expected.  Really enjoying it.    Thanks    Rose
2386,5,"this stand mixer is amazing. I recieved this as a gift and could not be happier with it. The power this things packs is amazing. The clean up is a snap, and the manual comes with a lot of recipes to use with your mixer too.<br />Ive made pizza dough with it, and baguettes, pound cake, shortbread, etc. The spiral dough hook that comes with it works like a charm! The way it kneads yeast dough is great. No matter what you are mixing, this thing has the power to do it. With nearly 600 watts of mixing power, a 6qt bowl with a capacity of up to 14 cups (all purpose) flour, and the attachments that come standard you can start mixing (and impressing) friends and family:)"
2387,5,"We love this timer. It takes a little patience at first to get used to operating it, but once your catch on it is fantastic. I even took our old one outside to the grill for timing when grilling. It didn't break by falling, that happened many times and it kept on working. It broke when it was knocked into the dishwater -- deadly!! So do be careful to keep it away from the sink."
2388,5,My husband loved this quesadilla maker.  It works very well.  We have not had any problems with it.
2389,5,"This is THE BEST multi mixer you could ever buy!  When I got married 12 years ago, we got this as a present.  I have used it constantly throughout those 12 years and it has just started showing signs of dying.  I don't think any other mixer would have lasted that long with what I put it through (especially for the price that was paid...excellent value)!  I have used it for chopping nuts, making smoothies, mixing pizza dough, and whipping cream as well as a multitude of other tasks.  Highly, highly recommended and very versatile!  I know my next mixer will be the exact same one!  :)"
2390,1,"DO NOT BUY the Calphalon One Non Stick Pan<br /><br />I am a good cook, and I know pots and pans. The Customer service I received from Calphalon was superb.  Within six years, I returned FOUR Calphalon One Non Stick Pans to Calphalon for replacement, and  each time, I received back a brand new pan which was sent by the company within only 3 to 10 days, after they received my pan.  Superb customer service, and this company really does stand behind their (INFERIOR) product.  Maybe I will try to sell online, the new pan I just received from Calphalon, to end my culinary nightmare.<br /><br />The pans work very well for approximately 50 to 100 uses.  Then the surface of the pan becomes dull, food sticks, and the pan becomes worthless.  I have treated the pans very carefully, using good quality nylon spatulas, cooking below maximum allowable temperatures, and always waiting for the pan to cool off for at least 20 minutes before washing with mild soap, and a soft sponge.  However, I have found the inexpensive non stick pans I purchased at my local retailers to last as long, or longer than Calphalon non stick pans.<br /><br />I have had better luck with my Calphalon infused Anodized pan.  I have only returned one to the company in six years.  The Calphalon infused anodized pan sears very well, although it is sometimes moderately difficult to clean, when adding sauces to meats.<br /><br />Although Calphalon provides outstanding customer service, please do not purchase the Calphalon One Non Stick pan, unless you are prepared to return it to the manufacturer after using it for a fairly short period of time."
2391,4,"Product does as promised, keeps coffee hot. Carafe arrived loose in box, lousy packing and the lid was off and all over the box. Carafe was scuffed up a bit in shiping but not enough to send back. I guess free shipping is poor shipping."
2392,2,"The bad news..the garland comes flat, a spine with 6 inches either side of hard rubber-type pine branches (like half a railroad track). The branches are all identical, so you really have to work the greenery to make it look natural. It's also very heavy. I don't think it looks as nice as the product photo, because it doesn't look as full.  The good news....my price was 1/3 the original cost. I'm planning on adding greenery from a craft store to provide branch diversity. It looks better than the plastic paper stuff you get for 12.99 at craft stores."
2393,5,"I love this product, I've bought several and given several as gifts, everyone's amused.  It really works well, and if you don't make a large, full pot of pasta the utensil will replace the strainer and save you another moment at the sink after dinner.  Holds up well, no staining, burning, fading, or other unpleasantness.<br />I actually buy one every time I need to reach the Free Shipping threshold."
2394,5,"[[ASIN:B0006G3JRO Cuisinart CSB-77 Smart Stick Hand Blender with Whisk and Chopper Attachments]]  I received the above as a wedding present, and hate everything but its looks.  This model by Braun is awesome!"
2395,5,"I know there are several ways to open a bottle of wine, but the waiter's corkscrew will always be the best and most reliable method. This corkscrew is the best one I have ever found. Excellent quality, very user friendly, and really well priced!"
2396,5,"I love this scale!.. so attractive that I leave it out on my counter all the time & doesn't take up that much space.  Very useful in weighing foods (by ounces or grams) ..and really like how you can put a container on it, zero it out and only food weight shows & NOT the container weight. Great item for Weight Watchers and got it for $10 cheaper than scale they sell at WW meetings."
2397,5,"This is my favorite piece of cook wear hands down.  I love cooking stews, chili, soup, sauces.  I have used it to slow cook meal in oven. I wish it wasn't so expensive as I would buy more if I could.  Love the color!"
2398,4,"I wanted a small (2 quart) pressure cooker, but they were very expensive and cost well over $100! Therefore, I decided to buy this reasonably priced Presto pressure cooker although it was 4 quart in capacity. It is little heavier and larger for me, but it serves the purpose well. It is well built and made of stainless steel, and I am happy with it. I bought this for $43 from Amazon."
2399,5,"As soon as I touched this in a Brookstone store I had to have one! My husband has one, I have one, and my dad has one! They're so worth it! They've never stained anything of mine, but I'm sure washing it would fix that. I certainly wouldn't give it a one star because of that though! Maybe a 4...Anyways, this blanket is incredible, durable, and sooooo soft. I even took it with me to Iraq and sometimes I think it's the only reason I can get to sleep at night. I'm gonna get the queen size one for Christmas....I HOPE!"
2400,4,"I just purchased this knife at Kohl's (cheaper here at Amazon) and I love it. My current knives are a mix of Chicago cutlery and a cheaper set that was a wedding gift 15 yrs ago. I'm currently trying to upgrade as finances allow. I bought this one because the regular chef's knives were sold out and I have been curious about the santoku ever since Rachael Ray came to rise on HGTV. I like the way this feels in my hand - not too heavy, not too light. I just used it for the first time tonight and it chopped through my vegetables and meat for my homemade soup in no time! May look for others in this series, too. A good upgrade!"
2401,4,I WAS PLEASED WITH THE ROASTER AND THE SIZE MAKES IT USEFUL FOR ALOT OF THINGS.
2402,5,"We've had this cooker for a couple years now.. It's a great thing to have in the kitchen, We love it.  But.. We've lost the Gasket on the lid that changes between Pressure, Steam, and clean... Anyone know where to find a replacement?"
2403,4,The fruit and vegetable strainer works well for tomatoes and apples and other fruits and vegetables with larger seeds.  The screen is not fine enough for raspberries.  I put the berries through twice and got a lot of seeds coming through the screen.  I still had to use my old hand crank food mill to seperate the seeds from the pulp.  I use it on speed #4.
2404,5,This product is perfect for my needs and arrived in a very timely manner. Excellent!
2405,5,"I already had one of these mixers and when I saw this one and the great price, compared to in the stores, I had to buy it for a friend who was getting married. Needless to say, they're very happy campers too! The mixer whips better than any I've had and I love my dough hook. I'm getting some of the attachments for my own mixer soon - pasta anyone?"
2406,5,"I received my pillows in the mail today. The fabric is good quality and they look nice. The green and blue is a bit brighter than the photo, but I still like them. Very stylish."
2407,4,"I really like this kanteen but unfortunately, it's way too heavy for my 1 year old to carry around.  Once it has water in it it weighs quite a bit and can really hurt when it's dropped on baby toes.  I'll have to put this away for now but I'll use it again once he's a little older and stronger.  It's also a lot bigger then it looks.  It's more of a Jr. size water bottle then a toddler sippy."
2408,4,"I use the 8\\"" knife the most, but I have the other go to knives, which I use as they are required.  If you find better units for the price let me know."
2409,4,"I received this set as a wedding gift two years ago and all three pieces work well.  I especially like the spoons - they save so much space by having multiple measurements in one spoon (as opposed to a separate spoon for each measurement).  They are easy to clean and easy to use. The cup is good for peanut butter and shortening, but I don't use it for liquids.  I really like my adjust-a-measure set and would recommend it to friends and family."
2410,2,"I just got this item in the mail last week, and it already had a stress crack by the handle!  The crack seeps, I was really disappointed...usually I am all about EVERYTHING that Target sells, but this time I was a little bummed!  It will now go on top of my kitchen cabinets with some pretty silk flowers or something...because I do think it is very pretty.  (PS~ I was even really careful with it because I wanted to preserve it's look.)"
2411,5,"SUMMARY  The Waring WMK300 Professional Belgian Waffle Maker turns out perfectly browned, light, fluffy waffles every time, even with low carb and multi-grain batter. Cleanup is also very easy - fewer crevices means that you don't spend hours with a toothpick cleaning it out, and the catch tray underneath catches excess oil, spray, etc. Also, because you \\""turn the waffle over\\"" after pouring in the batter, it is more evenly distributed in the tray and seems to help with cooking.    ABOUT THE PRODUCT  The Waring is a little different than the other products out there - it has what appears to be a slightly smaller cooking area that you fill with batter and then \\""turn over\\"" the waffle for it to cook. There is a power light on the front, as well as a \\""ready\\"" light on the front when it is ready for you to add batter, and also for when the waffle is done. A catch tray underneath catches excess batter and \\""coating\\"" oil for the plates. You simply turn the iron on, wait till the \\""ready\\"" light comes on, spray cooking spray (such as Pam) on each side of the waffle iron, add the batter, \\""turn over\\"" the waffle, and wait till the alarm sounds (and \\""ready\\"" light comes back on). It has an adjustable \\""browning\\"" setting that you can raise or lower (but go in small steps!).    THE COMPETITION  We have tried the best rated versions of the Black and Decker, VillaWare, and Krups waffle makers. All three had sticking issues and turned out soggy waffles. The B&D and Krups were also particularly unreliable with low carb waffle mix and multi-grain waffle mix - I would end up with burnt crumbs that took a lot of time to clean out. I also had no luck with very thick or thin batter with any of them, if people wanted more substantial waffles or very light and airy ones - it would always stick or turn out miss-happen pieces. The difference is so significant vs. the other makers we have tried that I find I can feed by 2 year old daughter multigrain waffles and get away with it. On the Krups, she was lukewarm about the regular waffles and we had no shot with the multigrain (read: healthier). Call that subjective, but its worth a million dollars to me.    UPDATE July 2009  This waffle maker is still going strong, with no issues and turning out waffles as nicely as ever.  We use multigrain waffle mix as well as Aunt Jemima Complete in it, and kids and guests love the waffles.  We wouldn't trade it in for a different one if you paid us.  Well, ok, maybe for a LOT of money :) (we'd spend part of it to buy this waffle maker again). :)    UPDATE July 2010  Still going strong!  Have recommended this to several friends, and one came back and thanked me.  They purchased a cheaper waffle maker, endured weeks of sticking waffles, and finally bit the bullet and spent the money on this one.  Better waffles, never stick, and about as easy to clean as a device like this can be."
2412,1,"I bought two PUR faucet mounted water filters and within 6 months both are leaking, but not from any of the connections. Rather, they are leaking through cracks in the plastic filter housing. It is as if they used faulty plastic that is now breaking down. One might think it has something to do with our water, but the second filter was given to my mother and father in-law who live in another state. I asked for a replacement and they gave me a coupon for $10 off. I will not buy another one."
2413,4,They're pretty and blue and haven't broken.  The three sizes nest nicely and afford me a nice selection when choosing which one to use.
2414,5,what can i say? for the price it's perfect. good quality and nice size... i can steam milk for up to three drinks.
2415,1,"Well, was all excited to find something that brews as fast as the Bunn. <br /> <br />Bought one on Ebay for $29.99.  If you want a fire, then buy this.  It leaks from the bottom and ends up sitting in a pool of water. <br />Bummer!"
2416,5,priced very reasonably. I like this because all you can see on my door is my wreath:-)
2417,5,I purchased these sheets based on the evaluations of others.  I was not disappointed!
2418,5,This is my third order of Farberware. The quality is exceptional without a huge price tag!
2419,4,"For me--an adult already knowing how to sew on big machines, this was marketed as a kid's learn to sew sewing machine, but I bought it for basic fixes. So far, it seems like it will serve that purpose--small jobs. For a mini, it's adorable and similar to the real ones. needles are replaceable, threading is similar, bobbins can be loaded, and there's even a power pedal. I love the fact that it's portable--using 4 AAs. Instructions are horrible. Descriptive, but not instructive. Ask someone who knows how to sew. Cute otherwise."
2420,5,good product at a great price.  can't beat pyrex for performance and usability
2421,5,This is a terrific pasta/straining pot. Sturdy and easy to clean.  I had a cheaper version (different brand) of this and it wore out quickly as I should have anticipated - that's why I bought this one.  Good quality.
2422,5,"After trying what feels like 18 or Starbucks' 98,000 dark roasts, I have found one I will stick with.  This coffee has a strong, smoky taste and isn't as acidic as most of the other dark roasts.  The beans arrived fresh in two of the larger vacuum-sealed bags like you see in the stores.  Awesome coffee!!"
2423,4,"This item worked as expected.  It did a fine job of separating broth from fat, and it is dishwasher safe."
2424,5,I received my bakeware extremely quickly and was thrilled with the quality.  The bakeware set is awesome.  The sets are very substancial and the quality and price was unbeatable.
2425,5,"PROS: <br />The design is striking; sleek polished heavy insulated stainless steel, simplified filter system compared to other models, easier to clean than any Bodum I ever had; Ive owned 2 regular glass bodum with the steel cage (the glass always ends up broken, not a problem with this one), and the oversized Bodum 32 oz I purchased in Montreal (black plastic top with a cork base). <br /> <br />Cons: Price, unless on sale like I got it at Amazon ($29 USD), rubber seal for plunger works well, but can stick a bit sometimes(so do the metal on glass designs), if you're a big burly bloke like me, you'll live (but if its a present for mom or your grandmother, they might complain occasionally). White/clear rubber on seal turns brown quickly, should have made it black instead. The lid is ok for storing coffee for about an hour and a half, two hours tops; slightly different design for lid may have increased the heat retention at least three times that if the lid was insulated as well- the walls of the urn are heavily insulated, but the lid is single walled with a plastic strainer that turns to close. <br /> <br />BOTTOM LINE: <br />The best french press I've ever owned from bodum or anyone else. French press is in my opinion the best flavorful coffee you can brew. <br /> <br />A definite hit despite the insulation of the lid not matching the insulation of the urn, It's well made, very nice looking and works well, just dont expect really hot coffee after 2 hrs or more. <br />"
2426,5,More than one cup a day ?  Guests ? The office ?  Why wouldn't you ?
2427,5,I have enjoyed using this skillet it came very well packaged.
2428,1,not worth it. The pasta sticks together even after stiring it. It doesn't cook it properly.
2429,5,Emerilware is a great stepping-stone in cookware between the common store bought stuff and the extravagantly priced All-Clad type cookware. It is perfect for me. As a matter of fact I Like the slightly lighter weight of the Emeril line as apposed to the All-Clad. The only thing that I don't like is that I noticed the newer pieces from the last six months or so is made overseas. I don't recall that they were before. This steamer fits the 3-quart lidded casserole pan and 3-quart saucepan perfectly.  It also fits the 2-quart saucepan but as another reviewer mention it does not leave much water in the bottom of the pan.  I do wish that the emerilware line would come up with a double boiler with the same configuration as the steamer.
2430,1,"I should begin this review by saying that I own a number of All Clad pots and pans, each of which is made of exceptional materials and functions perfectly.  For the serious home cook, they are well worth the cost.  I purchased my All Clad food mill based on this previous experience, from a famous NYC gourmet/housewares retailer.   <br /> <br />The food mill itself is beautifully made from top quality materials.  The fit and finish of all components is excellent.  But the design flaws are so glaring that I suggest you avoid this product entirely.  What are the problems? <br /> <br />First, the narrow recesses at the bottom of the mill's bowl (into which you put the foods to be processed) are SO narrow and so precise that they fit only onto a specific bowl, not one you might happen to already have in the house.  This results in additional expense. <br /> <br />Second, while the three graduated inserts are an excellent idea, so that one can get various textures of milled food, the blade that rotates on top of them has a very acute angle of attack against the inserts, and so anything larger than a pea will not fit under it and thus be forced through the insert. <br /> <br />Third, the blade is held against the insert by the downward pressure of a spring.  The spring is too weak to exert much pressure, and so the blade often rotates uselessly atop the insert while your food is stirred around on top of it.   <br /> <br />Fourth, and most critical, the knob on the end of the handle ~ it's a large steel ball that fits perfectly in my hand ~ does not rotate as you crank the handle.  This results in a lot of friction against your palm and a lot of pushing and pulling instead of a smooth continuous motion.  This causes a lot of extra, wasted labor. <br /> <br />I bought this (unfortunately) horrid thing from a top-line merchant.  After I'd used it for Thanksgiving dinner, I showed the department manager its obvious flaws.  He totally agreed with me that this is an inferior tool, and refunded my money with a smile.   <br /> <br />Given the quality of other products made and sold by All Clad, I'm surprised they released this thing for sale."
2431,4,"nice print, cheesy frame, but you get what you pay for.  you can't go wrong with floral paintings from Georgia O'Keefe"
2432,5,"The River Of Goods Arm Chair 5805 is a very good value for the cost, looks more expensive. The color is a little darker than viewed on the computer, but nice, cloth pattern and carvings are beautiful. Easy assemble, double bolted for extra strength, simple picture directions, sturdy construction. Well packed for shipping."
2433,1,"Great disappointment. That summarizes my experience with this attachment.<br /><br />The manual's first page has this phrase \\""This attachment has been approved for use with all KitchenAid household stand mixers\\"". Nevertheless, it does not fit mixers marketed in Europe and Latin America. The mixer has a ring guard in the beater shaft that makes it impossible to use the ice cream attachment.<br /><br />I wish I could send it back, but I no longer have the box and it would cost a lot of money to mail it. I guess I will have to make a lamp out of it :-)"
2434,5,"I bought it in March. My first concern is that my neighbor downstair will complain the noise, but she told me she even didn't hear the noise. So far so good. Only con is the spin cycle is too long. Thanks."
2435,5,I bought this set for my son in college.  He loves the modern look and and fact that it's not heavy like ironstone.  Add that to the fact that it's unbreakable!  Great product.
2436,5,"A wonderful, beautiful grill, that worked great for my first panini! I can't wait to make my first waffles."
2437,5,I cannot thank you enough for sending the forks. I had looked long and hard to find them.
2438,5,The Sanyo grill has been perfect for grilling indoors since we've had to move into a travel trailer after Hurricane Katrina. The grill taste/quality is much the same as outdoor grilling and this unit is very easy to clean.
2439,5,"This is a wonderful product to quickly heat water for tea, jello, etc. It holds enough water for about 2 cups. I've been using Hot Shots for 30+ years.  I have only had 4 in all that time.  My last one started leaking, so we decided to purchase a new one.  I also bought one for our condo in Florida because I can't be without one!  It is a great product for heating water"
2440,5,"Update 9/10/07:  Before purchasing this knife separately, check out the Shun Classic U2 (Ultimate Utility) Knife.  You may like it better.<br /><br />I believe if you're serious about cooking, you should own great cookware and excellent knives.  I finally stepped up and got excellent knives.  For those who haven't heard the hype, Shun is one of the most respected knife brands in the world.  Check them out on the Web at kershawknives.com.<br /><br />Great features of the entire line include these cool \\""D\\"" shaped handles that fit your hand better.  Every Shun Classic knife is made in a right- and left-handed version (chefsresource.com for lefties).  The steel used for the blades is harder than what you would find in most other knives.  The knives are EXTREMELY sharp.  One thing to note about Asian knives is that they must be sharpened at a different angle, 16-18 degrees vs. 20 degrees for German knives.  The Shun steel takes the guesswork out of getting the angle correct because of the flat edge on one side of the metal disc below the handle.<br /><br />Tomato knife -- I didn't eat tomatoes for a week while I was waiting on this knife to arrive.  I'm glad I waited.  I used to cut tomatoes with a steak knife and this is so much better!<br />I think this knife is the utility knife with scallops.  I don't have enough knife smarts to know the difference between serrations and scallops, but I do know I love this knife.  In Alton Brown's \\""Gear\\"" book, he prefers scallops, but didn't say why.<br /><br />This is an expensive, but lifetime investment.  I encourage you to visit stores and feel the knives in your hand to make sure you are comfortable with them. For more info on Shun, check out Alton Brown's website.  For ratings on various brands and types of knives, check out cooksillustrated.coms' equipment ratings.<br /><br />This is probably the best kitchen purchase I've made and the one I'm most proud of."
2441,4,This is a pretty good thermos. I like that it is small and can fit in my briefcase but it's size also makes it difficult to clean. The  coffee I put into it remains hot all day long but it only holds about 1.25 large cups of coffee. This works fine if you get your coffee in the morning but you may want a larger model if you plan to have coffee from the thermos in the morning and afternoon.
2442,1,I received this coffee maker as a Christmas gift and was very excited thinking it would be very convenient.  I've been very disappointed however.  The very first time I used it I thought it was broken because all I could see in the time display was 8888.  Finally I realized you have to bend down and get on eye level with the display before you can read the numbers--is that bad design or what?  Didn't they ever try using this coffee maker after they designed it? Then I made my first pot of coffee and it was very weak.  I finally realized that I need to use nearly double the amount of coffee to make the same strength coffee as I did in my old Mr. Coffee coffee maker.  Instead of being very convenient this coffee maker has been very annoying.
2443,4,"Good coffee press, but it doesn't begin to approach 3 cups of actual capacity.  In fact, it doesn't quite make one full mug, but it works great and the quality is good.  Only complaint is over rated capacity."
2444,4,"Although somewhat of a novelty item, it does produce perfectly round shaped fried eggs. I have had the best results by spraying it with oil and when I want to flip the egg, I loosen the edges with a spatula, slide it out of the pan and on to the spatula then flip it back into the pan."
2445,5,"I had an indoor citrus tree that had just put out two small, but good-looking limes and decided this would be my first recipe attempt with the Muffin Magic manual - lime muffins.  I was a little skeptical during the process - not so much in the Muffin Magic's ability to produce - but with my recipe efforts. I subbed low fat Bisquick for the flour and used Splenda instead of sugar and just in case the two limes wouldn't make six muffins - halved the recipe.  End results?  WOW!  What great tasting and textured muffins!  The next batch?  Blueberry muffins.  They were yummy too.  Can't wait to try fresh blackberry, tayberry, or raspberry muffins when they are in season.<br /><br />Breville's products are built solid with thoughtful ergonomic features built in - the hole in the plug that lets you easily pull it out of the socket is a perfect example.<br /><br />Grabbed this maker on sale here - what a great, healthy-smart purchase!"
2446,1,"I would give this a zero star if I could.  After about 30 uses, the metal gear slipped, and the center plastic assembly cracked.  I broke it apart to fix it and it did the same thing on the next try.  Spend your money on something else.  This gadget is terrible."
2447,5,"My husband and I are what you might call coffee snobs.  I considered buying the Capresso but I was too cheap.  After reading all the reviews, I decided this Cuisinart may be our salvation from burned coffee sitting on the burner too long!  And it is!  I think it works great and makes a good cup of coffee (helps when you start with good beans!).  We have only had a problem with it spilling during brewing the very first time we made coffee.  Haven't had a problem since.<br /><br />You do need to make sure the lid is threaded on correctly.  It's pretty obvious when it gets misaligned.  If you have to start forcing it, then it's probably on wrong.  And you have to make sure the brew basket is in correctly, but once again, that's easy to do as long as you are paying attention (although at 6:30am pre-coffee, it's hard to pay attention!).<br /><br />In our experience, it keeps coffee hot for about 3-4 hours.  What's nice about it though is that even when the coffee gets to be lukewarm, it doesn't have that nasty burned taste that our old coffee maker would produce from sitting on the heating element for two hours.  The end of brewing beep is kind of loud, but it's out in the kitchen, so who cares?<br /><br />Overall, we are very happy with this purchase.  We don't use the auto setting very often as we like to freshly grind our beans, but it's been easy to set up when we have done it.  Easy to clean, and I like the white with stainless steel since our kitchen is white.  The coffee maker is pretty tall so make sure it will fit under your cabinets.  I have to pull it out away from the cabinets to pour in the water, and then move it back underneath."
2448,1,"The colors are nice, but they are just photographed onto the  sheets and comforter. The sheets didn't even feel like cloth, they felt like a disposable paper table cloth. The feel of the sheets and comforter was terrible, and the overall quality was really bad. Save your money"
2449,5,"This coffee maker is incredible.  I'm not sure if it's the gold filter or the water filter that makes this coffee maker make such superior coffee, but I guess what's really important is that it does make great coffee.  This coffee maker also looks great in my kitchen."
2450,1,"Beware, these scissors are low quality, not what you would expect from Henckels.  They are manufactured in Korea and China with cheap, uncomfortable plastic handles.  I own a genuine pair of Henckels kitchen shears which I purchased at Macy's about 20 years ago.  They are still in great condition and work perfectly.  This is the type of quality that I was hoping for when I purchased this 5-piece set. Unfortunately, what I got was a set of cheap imitations. I returned my order.  Don't make the same mistake that I made."
2451,5,I registered for this set for our wedding and I absolutely love it.  We have all of the canisters and the table accessory set.  Everyone has commented on how cute our new kitchen is.  If only we could find the soap dispenser!
2452,5,"I purchased the queen size frame. It's sturdy and easy to assemble. The price is also great, even with the shipping it still came out $10 cheaper than the most inexpensive frame at my local Sleepy's."
2453,5,"Best coffee maker I've owned! I like everything about the design and appearance.  The basket is very easy to access with the release button and the basket lifts out easily if you need to clean it.   Also, the coffee gets very hot.  I like the filtration system too.  If you don't want to use the Britta water filters there is an insert that comes with the coffee maker that can be used in place of the filter. The only negative is that the carafe will spill/leak coffee around the lid  because the spout is narrow.  I've gotten used to this, but others who make coffee with my machine tend to be messy.    October 2009--I'm still using this coffee maker and haven't had to replace it.  It's still great.  Everyone who comes over to use it compliments it and I've had several friends/family get one for themselves."
2454,5,I love this sports bottle!!  I take this with me everyday and it has held up quite nicely.  The straw is very convenient too especially when my son wants a drink.
2455,3,"Just got my 1 litre teapress. Did not come with a pad like all Bodum coffee presses; that's disappointing, and sorely missed. I don't find the user-friendliness quite optimal... The press is okay, sort of, but I would just as well like to have the option of another cover to go and serve the tea without that whole column apparatus flip-flopping around the pot's opening, into which the tea press does not fit snugly. Cleaning it is also somewhat of a clumsy affair. I have used loose herbal concoctions and not had the press's holes clog up so far, as a previous reviewer alluded to, but I'll be trying finely cut Russian Kousmichoff tea soon, and will keep my fingers crossed. Finally, while the coffee presses have metal filters and spring-loaded O-rings, the tea press has a silicone O-ring seal and I have my doubts as to its longevity. Voil&agrave;! Bonne chance..."
2456,5,"My mom bought the Back to Basics Stove Top Popper and passed it on to me.  I have enjoyed many, many hot, fresh, tastey bowls of popcorn from this little gadget.  I have experienced no problems whatsoever with the lid or the pot.  Its an excellent popcorn popper and beats microwave popcorn any day!"
2457,5,No doubt the best Waffle Iron my husband has ever used. He really enjoys using it. Even the measuring cup they supply makes perfect size waffles with no spill-over. Clean up is so quick-I never have to twist his arm to make Waffles. He even took it camping with us and made breakfast for our Club. I'm sure we sold atleast a dozen for you just that weekend.  <br /> <br />Thanks Again <br />Betty & Paul
2458,3,I bought this piece in store and believed that i was getting an excellent deal.  Its seems that this dark wood furniture like the Dolce Collection is a hot item.  Unfortunately target doesnt suppy enough instore of either collection.  I bought the last armoire and took it home to assemble on my own.  While I wasnt dissapointed at the amount of time it took to assembe I was upset at the outcome.  The stain on the doors are uneven and the doors are not evenly hinged.  the drawers are not even either. How to fix this problem I am not sure.  My problems sound similar to those of others so I think target should get on the ball and fix these issues!
2459,5,"I cooked professionally for over 25 years, and have had experience with many brands, and styles of knives. If I knew back then what I know today, I would say a Santuko, a bread knife, and a paring knife are the only knives needed to last your entire lifetime. (Perhaps a Boning knife if you do a lot of meat prep) This knife does everything a Chef's knife, a Butcher knife, and a Slicer can do. It holds an edge very long, and the handle is comfortable. I have found that Wusthof handles outlast Henkels before cracks develop in the phenolic.  The Grand Prix model would be even better for this than the Classic, with it's associated rivets. Slicing thin is easy, the indents in the blade do what they are supposed to do, release food.  A Santuko knife should be the FIRST item on anyones list of kitchen essentials. Brand's, of course, are personal preferences, this review is more about the style."
2460,5,"Hi, I must have thrown the agitator out with the last loaf of bread that we didn't get eaten before it went bad. Sometimes it sticks in the loaf. How can I get a replacement? We really love our machine. I miss using it. Grahamcreek"
2461,5,"My mother in law bought me this rotisserie for christmas. I must say it's the best kitchen appliance any one can have.I cook every thing in it: Chicken,Pork,Ribs,Turkey,Ribroast,Kabobs   and anything else I can think of.It makes cooking a pieace of cake...   It also cooks in half the time.&amp;quot;You set it and forget it&amp;quot;.   Meanwhile, you can take a break while dinner is on the way.    But don't forget to buy the black or silver as the white discolors from the heat......and if the spin rods make alittle noise just rub some cooking oil on it and your on your way to a delicious meal.   YOU'LL LOVE THIS APPLIANCE I KNOW I DO."
2462,1,"i can't believe this thing is already broken.  i used it maybe 5 times, where it seemed to be working OK, and now it tells me the ambient temp of my kitchen is 162!  it won't read when inserted into roasts, etc., either.<br />the timer still works.<br />i am going to try the fix recommended by a user here of baking the probe by itself for half an hour at 325 and see if that helps.  next stop, contacting Taylor.  overall very disappointing for what could have been a cool &amp; useful product."
2463,5,"I snagged this particular color because it was about $30 less expensive than the other colors available at the time. A few days later, when I was checking on my order, I decided to go back to the item to read more about it. Come to find out, the price had been knocked down to $99!! I decided to email customer service to ask if they would credit me for the difference of price, and they did!! AMAZON RULES, BABY!!<br />Since I have recieved this mixer, I have used it to make all sorts of cookies, scrambled eggs, meatloaf and even two loaves worth of my mother's Italian bread recipe. All have turned out beautifully. The only time I had a problem is when I was mixing the two loaves of bread dough at the same time. I did have to hold the mixer down because it was jumping all over the place, but I think that was my fault for trying to put so much dough in at once...lol. For the price I got it at though, I'm giving it five stars despite the cute lil' dance it did.....it has made my life easier and my time in the kitchen much more enjoyable."
2464,3,"I like using my crockpot because I like having dinner ready when I get home, but I wouldn't get this one if I could go back in time because the lid has never fit properly.  About a year and a half after I got it, I learned that a vacuum is supposed to be created by the steam, something that can't happen with mine because the lid doesn't fit.  Despite that, though, almost everything I've cooked has turned out well as long as there was lots of liquid to start.  I DO like the size, shape and the actual crock itself.  But the outer portion is almost flimsy and the design is ugly.  Also, I think I paid about $10 less at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond."
2465,5,This is the greatest item for our high-energy son. We have a very large doorway between the dining room and living room and it is perfect for him to go wild. I wouldn't recommend the jumper if you don't have a large doorway.
2466,4,"I bought this set over ten years ago and broke only one through sheer utter carelessness.  Back then they were called &quot;Oxford Glasses.&quot;  They're a great all around glass if you don't have a lot to spend but want quality and style.  They're extra large but you get used to them fast.  If they seem a bit wide for some, the vertical ridges aid your grip.  I need to drink lots of water for my health and the 18-oz capacity tumbler, which holds a full can of pop, helps fool me into drinking two glasses in one; I sometimes use an extra glass as a mini ICE bucket.  The cocktail glass is wide as well and heavy enough to CAN jellies or jams in for a pretty food gift."
2467,5,"My wife and I were very skeptical about Riedell glasses until we did a Riedel Wine Glass Tasting here in Austin.  We are now believers, and we now have our Riedel Travel Tote to carry our own glasses when dining out.  Sure beat paying retail price and got free shipping, too."
2468,5,"This is a wonderful little machine -- I cook dinner for my family nearly every single night, pretty much from scratch -- I work fulltime and I get home relatively late (6:30pm most nights) and I am able, with a little planning, to get dinner on the table around 7:30 most evenings - and this little bread maker is such a gem!  I held my breath when I ordered it thinking that for my ravenous crew (4 of us) the loaves might be so ridiculously dinky they'd not even give us each a decent slice - NOT TRUE -- there is enough in each loaf for all of us and usually there are 1-2 slices left over.  Also I have used, as someone else suggested in this string of reviews, the regular Red Star Yeast that I buy in bulk at Costco - and it works just FINE - so have not had to go and buy the more expensive little jars of rapid-rise yeast.  Very pleased with it. . . ONLY thing I didn't like (and this is a real nit) is the plastic outer housing is, I think, a little bit ugly -- probably something you just like a lot (like many have said) or you don't .. I think it would have been nicer to be a smoother ivory colour.....but that's NOT important."
2469,3,"The concept is great. This product makes good coffee and automatically turns off, which makes it safer.  The main problem is that the supplied coffee filter needs a top to prevent the expanded, water soaked, coffee grinds from flowing over the filter basket into the brewed coffee itself.  I solved this problem by spooning the coffee into a &quot;fold over&quot; paper filter.  This works and saves a big mess.  Now the coffee is grind-free and the pot is easy to clean."
2470,5,"I've had this machine for almost a year.  I use it daily and it sees a lot of use when we entertain.  It is so simple to use that our guests can serve themselves with little coaching.  I haven't used the frother and I use distilled water.  I froth milk for expresso drinks that require it with a hand frother and heat it in the microwave.  It is a foolproof system as milk is such a difficult liquid to work with.  That may explain why I have had no maintenance problems.  The flavor of the coffee depends on the bean used.  We have tried several different beans and using a real expresso bean gives the best results.  When the proper bean is used, the coffee has that excellent, unbeatable expresso flavor that we all love.  The cost of this machine appears high at first glance, but not a day goes by that I don't thank myself for spending the money.  I have owned Gaggia and other Krups expresso makers in the [less expensive] zone and suffered the work and cleaning associated with those.  It was simply too difficult to make expresso for a group with them.  This maching makes it easy!  I hope my Krups Orchestro lasts forever.  I could hardly face a day without it.  I do have one issue with the cleaning process.  I have used up all of the supplied cleaning products and have just sent an email to Krups to find a supplier for the tablets and powder cleaning chemicals.  Internet searches have not found them for me.  If you love expresso and are waffleing over a decision to spend the money for this one (I did!), jump right in.  You will not regret the decision and will think it was the best money you have ever spent."

2472,5,"Finally a coffee maker that does not take up a lot of counter space; that does not require those nasty paper filters; that does not periodically need a vinegar cleaning; and one that is not permanently coffee stained. More importantly, I can finally make a great cup of coffee.<br />If this coffee maker is stored on an open counter or shelf, it looks almost like sculpture.  It's fun too, and mornings need a bit of fun in addition to a good cup or two of coffee.<br />Even if guests don't get to see the way coffee is made with this Bodum, they'll be able to join me in a superb cup of coffee, and I'll get the kudos!"
2473,3,"First of all, I do not own this All-Clad scoop set, but I am in the market to buy. So why am I writing this &quot;review?&quot; In the hopes that All-Clad will take note and include a 1/3 cup in this scoop set (it's such a common measurement, I was amazed it is not included). That's why I gave it a &quot;rating&quot; of 3 stars (otherwise, I'm sure it would have deserved 5). <BR>     Secondly, if it is added to this set, I would definitely buy it. I own many All-Clad products, and they are without a doubt the best kitchen products I've ever owned!"
2474,5,"I bought this pan to try out the line before committing to a full purchase and I have been<BR>very pleased, in fact, I have decided to go ahead with replacing all my current cookware<BR>with this line (currently have Calphalon Professional Hard Anodized).<br />First, why am I replacing?  I like the Hard Anodized for the most part and it is certainly<BR>better than 90% of what is out there, but there are a few problems.  1) The pots/pans are<BR>very heavy compared to similar clad stainless pots/pans. 2) The Professional Anodized<BR>pans do not have the cool touch handles, which means that they get very very hot.  3) The<BR>Anodized pans can scratch and though it is mainly a cosmetic issue, I don't like the<BR>look of it.  4) Most of the Professional Anodized line do not have flared lips, which<BR>means that it can be very difficult to pour from them.<br />I looked at the following for potential replacements.  Le Creuset, which is beautiful<BR>but it is also even more heavy than the aluminum and I read that the finish can crack.<BR>It is also very very expensive.  All Clad, which is similar to the tri-ply, but<BR>more expensive, otherwise it seems very close to what I wanted.  And lastly, various<BR>brands of copper pots/pans, which look great hanging up, but from what I read, are a <BR>real bear to keep looking that way.<br />I did end up deciding that stainless of some sort was the way to go.  Stainless<BR>cleans up easily, is relatively light, and stays good looking very easily.  It also<BR>heats quickly without scorching.  The stainless finish gives a good visual indicator<BR>of what the food is doing when sauteing (especially when compared to the very dark<BR>anodized where you can't see anything).<br />Regarding cleaning, a previous reviewer mentioned that he/she had a problem with<BR>a residue on the interior of the pan.  According to the user guide and my personal<BR>experience, Bar Keeper's Friend scouring powder will take that right out.  It takes <BR>just alittle bit of elbow grease (and I mean very little), and it will polish right<BR>up.<br />So, I am definitely sold on these pots/pans.  Now, just to figure out what to<BR>do with the old ones, eBay here I come. :)"
2475,2,"After reading the review about customer service problems (and from other ratings sources), I decided to go with the Kitchenaid Professional 11 c. food processor.  After all, no matter how good a product is, if the company does not provide good customer service, then it is not worth the money."
2476,5,"i bought the coffeemaker because of kevin sinnott the writer  of &quot;great coffee&quot;. he mentions it as a coffemaker that brews at the right temperature (at least 195 degrees). only 4 coffeemakers that i know of reach this temperature and they all cost more than double the price of the kitchenaid.<BR>anyway kevin sinott goes on to mention that the coffeemaker also brews at the proper length of time (6 minutes), and all the coffee grounds are evenly extracted.<BR>my personal experience is that yes this coffeemaker does brew an excellent cup of  coffee. i would further suggest that for the ultimate experience in  good tasting coffee one use freshly roasted beans from a micro roaster or roast your own beans with one of the home roasters now on the market. also use the proper proportion of coffee to water which is 2 tbs of coffee grinds per 6 ounces of  water.<BR>as for the carafe dribbling the water mentioned elsewhere in the reviews on this site the simple s olution is to lift the lid when pouring the coffee. this prevents the dribbling."
2477,5,"I received the Spoon Spatula as a gift and must say that after going through several spatulas a year from melting and staining, I still have my first Le Creuset. In the past years that I have used this tool, it has slowly become a part of every meal preparation. The high heat tolerance allows me to wipe soups and sauces off the sides of my pans while they're still on the stove, or right out of the oven. The spoon shape is great for sampling liquids and scraping bowls clean. I even use it for cooking tomato sauces, which always stained my old white and clear spatulas. I would recommend this to anyone, and when picking one out, make sure it's a color you like, because you'll be seeing it for several years."
