0,4,It works as I wished.
1,5,Bought it for my daughter and she uses it everyday.  Battery life is good and its compact size makes it ideal for daily use.  sounds great and connects easily with her iphone.
2,5,Great product
3,5,"This unit is definitely worth the money. I compared 100's of wireless speakers everything from Bose to Jambox and this one for the price took the cake. This unit has a better design then the Bose system with a equal and sometimes better sound quality then the Bose system. It has a rich deep bass sound equal to that of a small sound big box system. When I first had this on my room mates thought I had a dedicated subwoofer. When they found out that it was from this small device they were amazed. I have since recommended this unit to 4 others who all love it, some wished they had demoed this before purchasing the similar Bose system.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* High Clear Crisp Sound<br />* Good Highs and Lows with no interference from case design<br />* Holds a very long charge (although will vary depending on how loud you play it)<br />* Easy Setup<br />* Very Durable<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Rubber on case makes it collect dust easily<br />* A little bulky but not bad<br />* Not able to function as a wireless mic when making calls<br />* Does not come with a carrying case"
4,5,Perfect fit. I love them. Bose wanted recycle them for 90$. I found a better perfect option!
5,5,"This little speaker sounds pretty good, it plays for quite awhile and charges fairly quickly, no issues with the charging port. We liked this little speaker so much we bought this one for my husband."
6,5,"These are some of the best buys available for earbuds; the trick however is to get these inserted into your ears deeply enough to seal them.  Once they are sealed, the bass and actually all sounds come out great.  It would be hard to beat the sound.  The problem I have is that they just don't seem to fit the way I would expect them to.  You have to insert them (to me) upside down with the wires going up toward the top of your head.  I believe this is so they can be looped behind your ears but it just doesn't feel right to me.  Maybe I adjust to this over time..  In any even, for the price and sound, they can't be beat..."

8,5,I just received these as a gift and they are simply outstanding.  The best headphones that I've ever used.  They are adjustable for head size and fit my head/ears perfectly (unlike some other models that I've purchased and seen fail soon after!).  Excellent sound and great build quality.  Very happy!
9,5,Nice wire. Works fine.
10,5,"Floated the river with this case & it worked perfectly!!! Awesome Sound and the speaker stayed completely dry! Very durable, Survived Rapids and plus it Floats!!!"
11,5,Great Item - Fast Shipping - Will Purchase Again
12,5,Fantastic sound.
13,5,Perfect
14,5,"Rock them all the time, they work about 50 feet from phone, its great."
15,5,Works very well
16,5,"I had no idea which antenna to buy, as read that really varies as to signal towers etc & my tower is approx 30-31 miles away so figured this would be fine. I just bought a new TV to replace a tiny TV for a small room that doesn't have cable & won't be getting it, but wanted to get just a few channels for guests.  This antenna is great & works really well.  I didn't want a really cheap one, but didn't want an expensive one either, & this one was right in the middle.  It brought in a ton of digital channels, including most of the local stations & some others like KCET etc.  The picture is very clear, which surprised me as was expecting it to break up like my old analog antenna, but it's actually almost perfect & I forget that it's not cable.  I really love the 20ft cable length, as works perfectly for the room size. I have it behind the TV, nowhere near the window, so am not using the suction cups.   **update 11/7/15 - love this thing, I'm still blown away at the quality of the reception it brings in."
17,5,Works fine for less
18,5,"I've had a GT40 for several years, since they first came out.  I've solely used mine primarily as a DAC in conjunction with JRiver Media Center software, and recommend both heartily.  The GT40 is one of the most satisfying and affordable components in my overall stereo system.  Every other component cost $1,000 or more.  Unlike other DACs I've tried, the output sounds nearly as good as original sources and the unit seems to be built like a tank.  I've had no hiccups or failures of any kind.  I assume that the other applications work as well, in fact I now remember using it successfully as a phono stage for vinyl conversion to WAV a couple of years ago.<br />UPDATE - 2/1/17 - I had my first issue with the GT40 tonight after several hours of listening via earphones with it (since my beloved 50 year-old 15&#34; JBL speakers are being refurbished).  I lost the right channel for no apparent reason, but if I pulled out the headphone plug part way, it would return.  OK, it's just a displaced or dirty contact, I thought.  I took the unit apart and to my dismay the receptacle is sealed, so I couldn't get to the contacts to &#34;adjust&#34; (translation - bend) and/or clean them as hoped.  After putting it back together, I inserted and retracted the headphone plug aggressively several times, and voila -- I have both channels again.  The next step is to treat the receptacle innards from the front with DeOxit.  This turned out to be a minor glitch, so far, following years of flawless and frequent service.  My previous 5-star rating stands.  I'd give it 6 stars if I could!"
19,5,as described!
20,5,Works great s far. Arrived when expected.
21,2,I received a previously used Ipod the product info said new. I was able to use it abs it works great.
22,5,Great but some macs are iffy and don't work because of the new OSX
23,5,happy
24,5,Excellent sound and tone! The wood cabinet provides a rich sound and every instrument is exceptionally clear.
25,5,"I took me all of 15 seconds to get it working. The most intelligent light bulb I have ever used. It however  takes about 30 seconds the first time to connect to the Bluetooth of the iPhone with one 'cannot connect to Bluetooth failure message'. Once you get over that the app is super easy to use, you can increase or decrease the bulb intensity but cannot change the color. The speaks in the bulb sound very good for my ears. I use this for demoes where I show that even old fashioned light bulbs have changed forever thanks to technology.  I am in Mumbai , India and the voltage is 230 v and the light worked without a problem."
26,5,Works great for both my iPhone 5s and my husband's HTC.
27,3,"These ear buds worked for quite awhile, but eventually became useless. I had used these for a couple of years, but one day one of the wires snapped. For their price it was expected that I'd have to replace them after several years. The sound quality was adequate, not bad, not great either. The length of the cord could have been longer, but wasn't too bad overall."
28,2,I've got to re-scan ever time I turn on my tv set
29,4,"Pretty sturdy, but creaky. The ear muffs are soft, but like other comments, circle not oval. This makes them an on-ear headset. Pairing was easy, as well as switching between devices. They are not super tight on my head and I have a large noggin (7.75 hat size). Buttons are easy to use once you have memorized the layout.<br /><br />Sound quality is nice when used with device EQ settings. I like how turning up the volume on the headset does not change the volume setting on the device. To clarify, you have some volume swing when your device is at 75% volume.<br /><br />Overal, good budget piece of hardware."
30,5,"Awesome! I bought them to wear at a noisy gym, especially in one of the CardioKickBoxing classes. So bought for the noise canceling feature. Muffles loud noise nicely and are very comfortable. You can't, however, jump with these, since too much movement stops the feature from working.  But just doing weights, kicking punching is fine. I've also tried listening to some lectures on my iPhone with them, so nice. I could hear the lecture perfectly, but the surrounding noise disappeared. I did this at a birthday party with in laws, at a fancy restaurant, great way to get through a boring event."
31,5,No problems at all it's really a great unit I would recommend it to anybody has many features and does many things and it sounds great great sound from it
32,5,Nice surge protector!
33,1,It arrived broken
34,5,Been very useful to find items
35,1,"Low quality connectors that don't seat well.  Tried 3 different pieces of equipment to rule out a problem with the amp I was using them on originally, and got the same loose fitting seat and terrible audio quality on them as well.  I see that they got some good reviews from other users, so not sure if this is a fluke or what.  This manufacturer needs better quality control to improve consistency."
36,2,This item does not fit my headset as advertised
37,1,"Initially this product worked like a charm, but after a year of use it started to fall apart where the cable and the rectangular device connected. The inner wires started to show to the point where it got dangerous to continue to use this product for fear of being electrocuted. For such an expensive item, the build quality is extremely poor and the customer service is lacking. When you bring it to BOSE, they have a policy where they do not fix these products. Instead, you have the option to buy a new pair for a small discount. Why would I pay several hundred dollars for another pair that will break down after a year? There's a fundamental flaw with the design. If Bose was really proud of their product, they would offer a lifetime guarantee. I will never buy another bose product again."
38,5,"This little antenna is absolutely superb. Simple to set up and reception is excellent. This is a directional antenna. It will work best outdoors, mounted clear of other objects and pointed toward the origin of the broadcast signal. My signals originate from 2 broadcast towers that are about 15 degrees apart. I never have to rotate the antenna to receive a strong signal for all available broadcast channels."
39,5,Very good product with good clarity and vibrant sound.
40,5,Perfect for my application. Thanks!
41,5,So far so good:)  what can I say - it's  a strip outlet and it works
42,5,Perfect and very very sturdy! Very proud of myself for guessing this right.
43,5,Excellent product
44,2,"I received this adapter today. My three-pronged laptop plug fits perfectly. It can be inserted fully into the adapter and fits snugly. However, I cannot get any two-pronged plug into the top of this adapter. I tried to insert the plug for a lamp, my cell phone and my kindle. Not one can go all the way into this adapter. They all can only be inserted halfway into the adapter and are very loose. I am leaving for London in two days so I don't have the time to return this for a replacement. What a disappointment after all the great reviews. I am not a happy camper."
45,5,"I love it. I ordered one, but was defective and received a new one which worked. I love that it has a built in mic."
46,5,"This is a great base for your HEOS speakers (you must have a HEOS speaker to use this).  It helps to protect the system from water, adds bluetooth capability, adds portability and battery power.  Now you can take a speaker with you or use outdoors.<br /><br />The base is easy to put on and take off.  It is also very easy to use for streaming music.<br /><br />The HEOS system just keeps getting better.  Enjoy!"
47,5,works as it should.
48,3,"The ear pieces are quite large, returned."
49,1,not good. disappointed.
50,4,Works great
51,4,these worked great. Supply of mounting bolts not so great. None would fit my Vizio sound bar. Good thing I always keep the extra bolts and nuts from other things I buy. Oh and when it's all mounted and ready to be plugged back in the top part of the brackets blocks the plugs on the soundbar making it a little tight when plugging in wires. Other than that I'm happy and it looks really nice with the soundbar off the tv stand.
52,5,Exactly what I needed for the Omron unit.
53,5,perfect
54,5,"My brother and I paired this subwoofer with JBL ES90BK's floorstanding speakers, and the JBL ES25CBK center channel. Our surrounds are old vintage speakers that we kept for the look because they can still do their job on the sound. This is all tied to a Onkyo TX-NR626 receiver. This subwoofer is more than what you need in the best way. The bass can overpower our setup even when we are completely cranked. That is to say that you will never lack bass if you want bass. Once you dial the levels in this subwoofer really adds to any movie or music you want to throw at it. Fantastic addition, great look, phenomenal sound. This is the item furthest from being a limiting factor on our setup."
55,2,Low grade product. Don't fit with bose never recommand to purchase.
56,5,This was such a fabulous surprise how great it is! Exactly what I needed. I know it's old school but I still like making and playing my own CDs. It came here in perfect condition. Wonderful!!!!!
57,5,I was very pleased w/ this mount. Very easy to install.
58,5,"So far , I have not had any problems. It sounds great .I give it a 5 star rating ."
59,1,"It's a lie, this control does not fit to replace the remote control of AH59-01778V"
60,5,"I was more than happy with these headphones.  I've owned good quality headphones that were too heavy and cheap ones that had no lastabilty at all.  The sound, ease and comfort of these is wonderful.  Buy them!"
61,5,Delivered quickly as discribed
62,1,the product simply did not work!
63,4,"This is a very attractive battery powered speaker and it works quite well.  The speaker is not capable of producing low bass notes to any degree of significance and has the typical mid-range sound you would expect for its size. The Bluetooth connection was very straightforward. It paired automatically and I didn't even have to go through the procedure outlined in the instructions. When a phone call came in, it became a speakerphone in the same manner a Bluetooth earpiece operates.  And when the call ended, it resumed playing music from the cell phone.  Everything has operated perfectly so far.<br /><br />There are a couple of things that I think should have been built differently. On the bottom is a routine mini charger port like the one on your late model cell phone and a mini-plug for audio input along with a reset button requiring a pin to activate it. To charge the battery, you must turn the speaker on its side during charging.  And to play music directly from a MP3 player, you have to do the same thing.  I think they should not have put the receptacles on the bottom.  Side location toward the bottom would have provided so much better access.  While playing directly from a MP3 player, it would be nice to stand the speaker up, but you can't do that because of the audio connection location.  And same thing for charging. It would be nice to be able to listen to music or a phone call with the speaker standing up as it is intended. It should not cost any extra to relocate these two connectors. The cosmetic appearance would still be good since the connectors are so small.<br /><br />I charged this speaker overnight about a week ago. The battery is still charged. I haven't tried to test how long it will keep a charge, but it's plenty good from my limited experience.  It's really nice to have a wireless speakerphone without needing a power cord.  For sure, the sound is much better than what I get from the speakerphone on my cell phone.  You need to keep a little distance between the microphone on your cell phone and this rechargeable speaker during a phone call or you may get some self sustaining squealing microphonic feedback similar to a stage microphone and speaker system. Usually even a short distance is sufficient.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very nice battery powered wireless speaker and is quite attractive.  It has a very well built appearance and with reasonable care, it should last a very long time.  The battery life will vary greatly depending upon the volume and type of music that is being played. Heavy metal has a broad sound spectrum compared to an easy listening Mozart piano concerto. So set your expectations accordingly. Distortion at loud volume was quite apparent, but when backed off to a pleasant level, I didn't notice any distortion.<br /><br />The price is reasonable considering the rechargeable battery and wireless Bluetooth capability.  If you are in the market for something like this, I think this should be seriously considered. The reason I took off a star was because I don't like the location of the charger port and audio input connector.e between the microphone on your cell phone and this rechargeable speaker during a phone call or you may get some self sustaining squealing microphonic feedback similar to a stage microphone and speaker system.

64,5,Thanks for the inventor. Good stuff!
65,5,very nice mount
66,5,Works great fast spipping
67,4,"Does what it's supposed to do, but not quite as loud as running music straight from the Blu-ray player."
68,4,These are very comfortable...so long as you never lose the rubber nubs. without that little rubber piece you're in for some painful listening.
69,5,Love the sound and comfort of these earbuds.
70,4,OK
71,5,Excelente
72,5,Product as described. Thank you.
73,5,"For the price, this cannot be beaten, I ended up buying two and find them to be working much better than anything else I have tried in the past."
74,5,Good product.  Good price.
75,5,"Works as expected, saves on cable."
76,5,nice product.  priced fairly.  arrived within the expected timeframe.  will do business with them again
77,5,This little MP3 player works great..! The battery lasts almost my whole eight hour shift of working in the noisy garage at work.  I love it.
78,5,"Solid, sturdy case, although a bit clunky. Fits my Sennheiser HD 598 perfectly with ample room left over for accessories."
79,5,This wireless set is not tied to any particular brand of home theater receivers unlike many other systems. It does what it is supposed to: deliver clean sound to my rear speakers. I have had this for over a week and love it.
80,5,Easy to install and works well.
81,2,"The primary function of headphones is good sound quality, right? Well with these, the price leads you to believe it'll be phenomenal, but it isn't, it's mediocre at best. The volume as well was good.. but everything lacked that.. oomf you get with ear buds, you know?"
82,4,Works just as described. Use it with a GPS unit and my phone charger and both charge as expected...
83,5,Pretty cool
84,5,"I have been using my earbuds for about two weeks now, and very happy with them.<br /> Connecting them to my S4 was quick and easy, and the sound quality is great!<br /> They fit snugly in your ear, I've use them will running on a treadmill and I had no issues with them staying in.<br /> I highly recommend them, great product at an excellent price!!"
85,5,Works better than expected
86,1,Not sure if it was the Sennheiser or  my TV. Either way I couldn't get it to work ! I'll be returning them  my next opertunity
87,5,Item is as listed.  good price. Quickly shipped.
88,5,"Update - *This survived a 6ft fall onto concrete*  It landed on the corner.  The plastic is not even that messed up.  Great build quality.  Everything still feels just as solid as before the fall. I think this is going to last the test of time.  The sound quality on  this is excellent.  I'm usually quite a bit picky with sound, but for its size this speakers has impressed me.  I have to say I was very surprised that this speaker sounds better outdoors than in a small room.  The rubber feet on this are very grippy.  It gets plenty loud. The sound is a bit directional.  But I feel like that is a plus so you can listen a louder while being less likely to annoy people around you. The speaker feels very solid.  It does not feel cheap. As long as you aren't throwing it around I think it will last a long time.  I have not used it long enough to say much on the battery life, but one of the main reasons I purchased this is when the time comes and the battery does wear out as any rechargeable will.  It can be removed and replaced with a higher capacity one to boot.  There are many how to's videos if you are curious how its done. Being that replacing battery's is much cheaper than replacing the speaker this should be a good long term speaker."
89,1,Sound is terrible.
90,3,lamp was okay but housing was wrong - had to take it out and put lamp in old housing
91,5,Great headset best I have had.  The service was great as I am a Prime member have been for many years.
92,5,I like the product
93,1,Wasn't what I needed
94,1,"Shortly after buying one side of earbud wouldn't play music, as well as playing through speakers when plugged in. Very bad do not buy. My 1$ earphones work better"
95,5,"Amazing headphones, especially given the portability and price. Sound is similar to Senn 558, and not very far off from from other fancy and more expensive headphones headphones - judging with my unqualified ears, while listening to CD rips/ALAC from FiiOx1. I don't get the feeling I am loosing a whole lot on sound quality when I am on the go.<br /><br />Very sturdy and clever folding mechanism. While these headphones are open, I used them in the library at low to moderate volume without complaints and criminal looks- when I put them down with the music still running, I had a hard time picking up any noise."
96,4,"This amp will be delivered to me tomorrow.  I plan to use it as an power amp only, paired to my Parasound pre amp.  Based on my seating position while  listening, I need the &#34;balance&#34; control  feature found on my pre amp, which none of the integrated amps offer.  For some reason, my classical radio station seem to have more energy directed to the left side as far as stereo is concerned (just hear the left speaker so as to sound like a mono recording) so I need to be able to make the right speaker louder to compensate for this effect.  I do have a solid state power amp which allows me to do this but I prefer the sound of tubes. I had to give it a star rating before I was able to post so I'm giving it a 4 star rating"
97,1,"It came before the day it suppose to, but it is really bad.... bought it for my hubby and to find out , one side works and one side don't. It is sadly really bad. Beware before buying."
98,5,"Best batteries i ever use,If loooking for the best,here they are"
99,1,The cushion on the headphones came right off the day we got it and there is no way we can get them back on.
100,5,Love it.  It is very fast to connect and gives me everything I needed.
101,1,Junk! Do not buy this crap - just send me your money if you are going to waste it! LOL CD player died in the first day.
102,5,"5 years ago I kicked cable TV out of my life and have not looked back, with all the great streaming programs I had a great need for hdmi cables. Throughout the years I had my share of cheap cords that came broken, broke within the month or were comically short. Always having to awkwardly place my computer next to the tv crossing my fingers that it will not fall from the corner of a table or the small space next to the tv. The answer to my problems was this heavy duty HDMI cable great picture, I love the length and the cloth cable in my opinion keeps the cable from fraying easily.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review."
103,2,only received three channels. not worth the money.
104,5,Needed a flat head cable extension for a lamp and this works just fine for that purpose.
105,5,"As advertised, KOSS brand is a trusted brand. I really enjoy their headphones."
106,2,The moment I put these on my BlueBud X headphones and into my ear - the sound and fit seemed very good but they tore upon my taking them out. Hadn't had them more than a day or two when it happened.
107,5,Arrived on time and is just as described.  Much handier than carrying another cord.
108,4,"3 senns later and I have to say these disappointeds me. I'm a big sennheiser fan and swear by them to all my friends but these just not as good as my other two pairs. Which other two? Hd280 pros, and recently the momentums. If you find my reviews on both you'll get better light but to be short hd280s had best overall sound, momentums best all around if you sacrifice little bit of sound to the 280s, these 598 would fall in the middle since I like the way they look and feel on your head but I was disappointed with the sound, especially how they leak so Much probably not a good flying headphones plus they cost the most when I got them the momentum were on sale for 10$ Less and just edge these out quite easily. 4 Stars for being a senn fan and they're cool classy looking."
109,5,The speaker works great and has great sound. The Bluetooth connection is very easy.  The speaker also has a great battery life.  While camping we had the speaker on continuously for over 8 hour and intermittent rain was never a problem.
110,1,"Whoever is thinking of buying this, drop the idea right at this moment! Bloody skullcandies sound better than these! Bass is nearly non-existant! Samsung default headphones sound better than this! I guess the sound quality equals that of those hanging in CVS or any convenience store cheap headphones. The ear loop stands way above your ears if you have smaller ears. Wires don't feel sturdier enough. This product is a total scrap."
111,5,"Read too many negative reviews after my wife told me she ordered these earbuds for me for Fathers Day - I am sorry to hear some people had less than stellar experiences with these, but they are terrific!  Fit ear perfectly (the larger buds) and, based in experience with the corded versions of Yurbuds, the company will custom mold of neither of the sizes included fit your ear.  They stay put during exercise (running, lifting, biking) and Bluetooth range is greater than 6ft - I typically keep my phone in my pocket."
112,5,I really like the quality of this cable.  It has a nice thickness and maintains great signal quality.
113,2,I use these in my Logitech Performance MX mouse.  They don't hold a charge for more than 4 days.
114,5,Fast ship will buy again
115,5,Bargain! High quality for a very reasonable price. Highly recommend. Very fast delivery as well
116,5,"It really like the sound from this. I got and it was little bigger than I thought, but the set up was easy and the sound is great"
117,4,"Great product. However, It'd have been 5 stars if the remoulding would have been easier, as when you re-heat it, it sticks to the vessel you use for heating leaving smudges.  I'd recommend it."
118,1,JUNK!  Only uploaded a couple of songs and didn't play them all the way through.  I had a very disappointed little boy.
119,5,a must buy.
120,5,Great!  Had them for about 3 months.  Good sound.  Easy to pair.  Ultra comfortable.  Affordable.  Great purchase!
121,5,Great i love it
122,1,"Cable to gresse, get dirty , no good for sharp turns.<br />Tx any way."
123,4,"Also warn to stay away. Within a year this will be my second wire replacement and the microphone just went out. So much for German quality. My crappy Siberia V2s are still working 3yrs later, but these can't last one. You lost a customer Beyerdynamic.<br /><br />UPDATE: I was livid with the problems I had during the first year, but it has been running with no problems as of late. Still, for the price spend the money on  a pair of headphones with the remainder going to a modmic. They will sound slightly better, and if the microphone ever goes out, it won't require a warranty fix."
124,5,Works great.  Mine is mounted under my gaming desk to hold my headphones.  No problems.
125,5,works perfectly and has been for over a year
126,5,"Great speakers for the price.  4 of them arranged over the pool from the edge of the patio roof, sound great.  No need to blow big bucks on outdoor speakers, In my Opinion anyway."
127,4,"no issues, worked fine"
128,5,Got 1.  Has worked great for over 6 years.  Use it maybe once a month.  Purchased a 2nd one recently.  Now I have a spare base.  They both look and sound great!
129,5,Its good as i expect
130,1,This is machined improperly. I had to add an eight inch rubber washer to get it to lock in place and even with that it comes loose
131,2,Not a good fit and sound is average.
132,3,"It is what it is,  it works"
133,5,"Bought these as a gift for daughter in college. Loves them, just wishes they would play a little louder, not enough volume for her. I guess that is a youth thing, music was never loud enough when i was that age either."
134,4,I recently had an installation at a client's side which would not allow running speaker wires. I got this wireless kit and it was easy to install and my customer is satisfied.
135,2,"Does not fit phones larger than 5&#34;, and even 5&#34; screened phones are quite snug (gs4) and will often hit the volume/power buttons along the edge. Returning."
136,5,"These are great speakers, small with a good sound."
137,5,Great sound great bass
138,5,"I was able to get all 4 cords, they are worth the money but keep in mind you get what you pay for. They are cheap cords that work well. I would recommend this to someone who just what's a replacement but dose not care too much for quality."
139,5,Everything went well
140,1,"I ordered the 5.5mm cable twice and both times I received the incorrect one.  I will try one more time, If I am not satisfied I will not order from Sentey again."
141,5,"As I posted on the response for the individual cables, these are great cables at a great price. Don't be afraid to use them. They are a great product!"
142,5,"Perfect, just what I needed to mount my sound bar. I would definitely buy this again."
143,5,"Battery backup. 8 outlets. Does what it says on the tin. I haven't installed the software that comes with these in 10 years, so have no idea how that works. I use it mainly to keep my iMac, NAS and Airport Extreme from powering off and on during brief intermittent power outages, and this works nicely. I had an older APC that lasted 7 years and replaced it with this one. The day after I swapped this one in, the power in my place went off for about 20-25 minutes while I was at work, and this was able to keep the gear I mentioned above powered on for that duration."
144,5,love this product very clear  sound and who every you are talking to can understand and hear you clearly with out yelling have bought 3 of these for my family they love them to
145,2,Doesn't work in my area. Seems well built but just not what I needed in my area I guess.
146,5,"It looks extremely stylish, it is portable.It is very easy to use,connecting to devices quickly and the quality of sound is brilliant."
147,5,"Great antenna.  Set it up in 2 minutes, scanned for channels, all worked like a charm."
148,4,"I got these for my wife. She's not picky, and she likes them just fine."
149,5,I researched extensively and read reviews for many wall mounts. This one lives up to its stellar reviews. The price is g-r-e-a-t and it is easy and quick to mount. Adjust easily to fit tv. This is the second one that I have purchased since we were so pleased with our first one. Highly recommend.
150,5,great product for the price
151,1,"The cd player doesn't work, the measurements for the screws are off and doesn't allow for a tight screw. I actually had to use a different screw for the horn. I haven't tried everything yet but I noticed those right off the bat."
152,4,"It works perfectly fine. I use it with DashCommand on a my iPad for a 2014 Mustang GT. It is very accurate. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the device its a little big and you risks to hit it with your left knew when you move out/in of the car. It also blinks all the time, and all lights blink at the same time."
153,5,works great for tv and cable box.
154,5,"Great product, do the job im happy.."
155,4,Sturdy and works good with room for a label.
156,4,"If you have an Android device use “USB OTG Checker” in the Google play store to see if your Android will read a USB jump drive (thumb drive) before purchase.<br /><br />This does not work on my new Android Galaxy Tab 4 (7 inch) but still gave this product four stars because it's not their fault and they are nicely made. This is my second purchase of a cables to read 2.0 USB drives from two different manufacturers. I will not return these, I just put them in the box of lessons for later use.<br /><br />Check your device before purchase. The app is free and requires no spacial permissions from your device. You can remove the app after the check."
157,5,I like how conveniently short this AUX is so it isn't cumbersome and it is equally convenient that can be expanded for users in the passenger or back seats.
158,4,An excellent unit with durability and highest quality.
159,3,Looks like they will work fine but one of the 4 batteries refuses to charge. My charger keeps saying it's defective. I've moved the battery around in different slots on the charger with the same result. The other batteries charged fine so I know it's not the charger. Hit or miss with these.
160,5,"The perfect gift and the battery lasts longer depending on how loudly you listen to your speaker as well!  I had no idea you could extend the life. The setup was a snap, the quality put a challenge against other BT speakers and the depth sounded great and being bluetooth, portable and having a plug for non BT devices makes this a great value.  BEING ON SALE did not determine this purchase, but I feel much better knowing I saved money too"
161,2,Not the quality I was expecting
162,1,Received charger with the wires cut. Completely useless
163,5,Awesome speaker!!!
164,5,I got this for my weather radio as we live in a somewhat severe weather prone area. It shipped packed well & accurately according to the time estimate & works fine :)
165,1,"Never worked. Was not able to even open until after having over 30 days as TV mounted in wall. When finally hooked up, wouldn't work. Called J-Tech without success"
166,4,"Worked exactly as advertised.  The receiver is small, and if I could change anything, it would be to have the receiver with no LED, but I guess it tells you it's working, so that's good."
167,5,This was some of the best money I've spent. It charges fast without a fuss and does not take up a lot of space. I have not tried the 9 volt portion since I don't use that type of battery. Very happy with it so far.<br />I would like to see a 12 volt DC version of this charger that works as well as this one.
168,5,"Good price, good delivery, good quality"
169,5,"Packaged nicely, works perfectly, and drives like a Cadillac!"
170,2,"This is an item I WANT to like, but after 2 nights of use I find myself shopping for a replacement.  The GOOD:  Sound quality &#34;OK&#34; for a clock radio, it has a relatively small &#34;footprint&#34; and with a couple of readings of the simple instructions one can figure out how to the  features.  And, I do like the &#34;Sync&#34; feature between the clock and iphone clocks.    However the BAD:  The clock is so ridiculously bright it can/will keep you awake if you prefer a dark bedroom for sleeping.  The clock is dimmable, but once dimmed even &#34;one notch&#34; the time then becomes unreadable.  The issue is the blueish white face being the black font.  Attractive in the product picture, but in use it becomes annoying to the point I cannot ignore it any longer.     As much as I like the concept and features of this iHome charger clock radio,  I'm sending this thing back and will take my lumps on the  shipping.  The brightness of the clock is poorly thought out."
171,4,Works as advertised.
172,5,The camera was nice but  too big for my Audi Q5 everybody would see it.
173,5,Great price did not have to wait long working great
174,5,Great for listening to music while swimming laps!
175,4,great
176,5,very sturdy with easy directions for installation
177,1,"This cable gave me a great first impression with the cloth wrapped cord and overall feel of superior quality.  My satisfaction for this purchase quickly faded once I tried to push them into the ports on the back of the TV and receiver.  The black tips, which is supposed to hold them in place, are slightly too large and the material does not flex to allow placement.  After just a few months, the cable has fallen out multiple times on both sides leading to damage to the tip.    Today the cable stopped working.  I would avoid this product and look elsewhere.  I just threw mine in the garbage where it belongs."
178,4,"Does a great job, but make sure you have a set of wrenches. This made-in-China product won't let you use a socket set to screw it in the wall, due to a design oversight. Regardless, it looks and works great!"
179,3,sound is great.  Odd charger
180,5,Perfecto
181,3,"These work fine, but I still prefer my Eneloops, which seem to last longer in my Xbox 360 controller."
182,5,"To anyone working in the food service industry; this speaker is the best for cooks.  Loud,sturdy, pairs instantly everytime ya turn it on.  range depends on walls but about 20 feet.  buy it unless ya just wanna listen to the hood."
183,5,Easy to replace the old ones. Perfect fit! Thanks
184,5,"This speaker is great. For its size it is loud, crisp sound. A great product for the price."
185,2,"so i bought this because it it the first google result when I type in (surge protector with ethernet splitter).  This does NOT have an ethernet splitter. No clue why it is the first search result.  I am writing this as a warning.  I am sure it says this under some information that I could have read before the purchase, but seeing that I googled ETHERNET splitter, it must of somehow passed me.  The splitter is for a phone line.  Why this is needed or even manufactured in 2015 is absolutely beyond me.  But here is my warning to someone looking for an ethernet splitter, this in NOT it"
186,5,"This is my fourth set of these headphones.  Not because they fail, but because they are a good buy!  Ive given a pair to my daughter (10), My grandson (14) and there are two lying around for others to use (including a 4-yr old).  They have all received heavy use and just keep working!  No cable failures, no cans coming off the headband.  Just solid sound whether from their smartphone or one of the various computers they use.  I noticed that the SONY name has worn off one of the blue ones, from constant use, but that is it!  Buy some before they raise the price."
187,5,"Works great, over priced as all get out.  Found a $5 one at Wal-mart that works just as good."
188,3,not impressed with set up
189,5,Helps to keep earbud wires from pulling when turning your head.
190,1,Got in the mail and wouldn't  charge or turn on. Sent them back got and went with a different wireless headset.
191,5,"I was never much into headphones. I was happy with earbuds and some OK headphones I found somewhere. Being a musician that sounds bad because I can hear every nuance of a guitar's sound. And I NEVER would picture myself buying a $450 pair of headphone. Never. But these were a gift, I was gonna sell 'em, but I decided to give them a try.<br /><br />They changed my view on headphones. The sound on these things is amazing. I've recorded at some high-end studios and these headphones are comparable, if not better than many studio headphones I've used.<br /><br />I started to go out and test other brands to see if I was just impressed stepping up from earbuds, I tried Beats Studio 2's and a bunch of other high-end headphones and these really blow them all away. Especially the Beats. If Dr. Dre's name wasn't on those things nobody would buy them, but I digress.<br /><br />Like I said, I'm a musician and I have a great ear for music and picking out separate tones and frequencies, but $450 is a lot of dough that could be put towards gear. Now that I know how much the listening experience is changed by good headphones I feel dumb for not trying a good pair earlier. The sound is crystal clear with crisp high, not overly prominent mids, and clean clear bass. With the caveat that you know how to EQ your music player and have a quality copy of your music.<br /><br />If you really enjoy music, not only the songs and lyrics, but the production value and the layers and effects that you can't really hear unless you have a $5000 set of studio speakers and a great hi-fi tube amplifier these are the headphones you need. If you just wanna rock out, there are cheaper options.<br /><br />The bluetooth is decent, but I don't move around much. I heard of latency problem with Netflix/Hulu/etc. but I haven't had an issue. They are kind of quirky to hook up, but I eventually get them to hook up. That's on me and my laziness and refusal to RTFM.<br /><br />If you got the dough and want the best in bluetooth headphone sound, these are the way to go.in bluetooth headphone sound, these are the way to go."
192,5,the bass tho!
193,5,"Love these things. I use them on hair dryers, toasters, microwave, etc. They have lowered the bill a little. Definitely paid for themselves in just a month or two."
194,5,Great product
195,5,"Lightweight, decent sound quality, great price."
196,5,Just what I've come to expect in terms of quality. A brand you can trust.
197,1,Had no issue screwing in the last bulb and I can't get this one to go in for nothing. Have been messing with it for a few hours and cannot figure out what to do. WASTE OF MONEY!!
198,1,"I wanted to like these, and at first they were OK. I bought them in October and by April, they were dying after only 15-30 minutes of use. Today they lasted for 11:41 into my podcast before shutting down after fully charging overnight. I had a set of Plantronics Bluetooth earbuds previously and while I had some problems with them too, battery life never was a problem and I was generally happier with the Plantronics. Definitely won't be buying the Soundot again."
199,5,"It was easy to assemble and works great for my needs, although I wish it were about 4&#34; higher.  I'm using it on my desk to raise my monitor so I can stand part of the day, good thing I'm only 5'1&#34; it just makes it height wise but could be higher.  Losing the monitor stand also gave me more desk space to cover in papers."
200,5,did the Job
201,5,It works as it is supposed to.
202,4,"Works well enough. Other complaints about the suction cup are no joke, the manufacturers even include a 2 sided gel sticky but it also failed. I had to use one of those 3M non wall damaging 2 sided stickers to get it into a position that worked for all stations. After I found the sweet spot, I have to say the signal looks great.  Make sure to check the FCC website to see how strong your OTA signal is in your area so you can adjust your expectations as to what stations will come in clear for you."
203,1,"It came in a weathered box, and when I went to pug it in and  the screen was not operating properly. I spoke with the Factory and they told me to replace the battery and if that didn't work it was broken and they would not warranty it. It did not work and I unfortunately am stuck with a bad Deal.  I hate leaving negative feedback, Darryl Lawson."
204,5,Was looking for a RG 174 cable to use with amateur radio.  The strain relief around the bnc connectors have been attached well. The cable checked out well using a multi-meter checking continuity.  Very satisfied with the product and expect it to work well for it's intended purpose.
205,5,"Received the product yesterday and my husband installed it. It works great, and it even came with a cable to make the HD TV show better. We love it."
206,1,I bought it for my brother and picked it up and it snapped in two. Did have great bass and sound but very cheap plastic.
207,5,"quality cable, well packaged and delivered fast.  Very happy with my purchase and would return."
208,5,"This remote is a great alternative to the standard Comcast remote. Set up was pretty much automatic. Love that the keys light up when you move it just a little--great for pausing or rewinding in the dark! Best thing: it's not really expensive. Yes, you get a remote for free from Comcast, but $20 for one that has the lighted feature is worth it."
209,1,Bought it for my nephew lasted 3 months the volume piece broke and only one side works.
210,1,RETURNED - KAROKE UNIT DID NOT COME WITH A MIC.  PURCHASED MIC SEPARATE AND THE MIC JACK DID NOT WORK. RETURNED UNIT.
211,5,Great replacement Remote!!!!!!
212,5,Worked as expected flawlessly in Germany. It also fit snugly on the sockets.
213,5,very good item.  thank you
214,2,The head band broke when I stretched it to put it on the first time.
215,5,"I have previously purchased these stands a while back so I wanted a matching set.  They seem heavy enough to hold my speakers.  Even though the speakers are non-traditional, I have found ways to use the enclosed brackets.  I now have 6 of these stands and i'm happy so far.  For those who have heavy speakers, they will tip over if you don't use the right mount.  I have a few that have the spikes in the feet and a few I'm trying with just the rubber tabs, just to see which is more stable.<br /><br />For a little wiring trick, I found it easier to thread the speaker wire through the bottom of the pole before placing it on the &#34;feet&#34;  that way you can just extend the pole and pull the wire with it."
216,5,"I had to wait for some time to get one of these great systems. It was worth the wait. After getting it mounted, my wife and I sat down with the 3D projector and it was great. No need to go to the theater anymore. The sound is terrific, setup was a snap and we are enjoying it immensely. we would recommend the Onkyo  to everyone. I did get the Mount-it heavy duty speaker mounts. The speakers are a bit heavy and these worked great."
217,5,I LOVE IT! So easy to mount on the wall!
218,1,It's not working!. The Bluetooth function never worked!!!..... I could be more unsatisfied.
219,5,Love these. This is my son' second pair. He wears them everyday and had the first pair for 2 years. I'm looking forward to another 2 years
220,5,Retro alarm clock should be able to wake up almost anyone! You have to set this every night before bed as its the old fashion traditional style.  You can press the light in the back if you want to read it in the dark (but its nice as the light doesn't stay on all night and disturb your sleep.)  Takes one battery.<br /><br />4/25/2015 - still using the same battery - the alarm keeps ringing until you get up and turn it off - as loud as a truckers alarm.  You have to get up and turn it off.  Don't know if it eventually goes off as its so loud I can't ignore it.
221,4,"It took a while to get delivered, but it's so cute and small and charming. If you are a moonie its worth the 12 dollars, if you aren't then this little phone charm may be a little too expensive. it's made out of some good stuff, it just tends to get dirty a little easily.  Easy enough to clean off. I gave this item four starts mainly because even though its really cute and well made it wasn't quite what I expected, but its def perf and worth the money!"
222,5,Nice player
223,5,Good deal
224,5,The best product ever made.
225,5,"I kept losing my headphones and now I'm onto my third pair, but it's not their fault. These headphones are great bang for your buck, which is why I keep reordering. Add some memory foam tips to your order for maximum comfort."
226,4,Very compact and very loud. But not so long battery life. This latest unit I got gets a little distorted sometimes but if it keeps doing that I would have to return it.
227,4,This works with my cell and laptop.
228,5,"Would have bought more for gifts, but was limited as to how many they would let me purchase"
229,5,"I ordered two of these 1 for my son for his birthday and one for the nursery...... this thing is really small good in the palm of your hand, but it is so cute! Has great sound range (I've tried some other cheap radios that you could hardly adjust the sound) I didn't realize when I bought this that it lights up different colors. Pretty easy to use once you figure it out, but I definitely had to look at the instructions. Cones with a usb and another audio cable. Altogether this is SO cute."
230,4,Works fine for me.
231,5,"My husband was able to set this all up himself, and it's tight and secure on the wall! We have a 55' Sanyo, and it works perfectly!"
232,5,"Excellent item with good sound. I wanted a speaker to mount on a fence above a spa. This fit the bill perfectly. In addition to the stake that is pictured, a well-designed wall mount is included. Options for directing the speaker are nearly infinite. These are not small speakers and will need thoughtful placement if you don't want them to stand out."
233,4,The monitors we bought didn't have the HDMI cable so we had to buy separately and these worked perfectly fine.
234,4,Works fine and is easy to use and connect.
235,5,"exactly what I was looking for, setup in a few minutes"
236,5,"I've got to say these earbuds are amazing, comparable to ones upwards of $30 dollars.<br />There is, however, a catch.<br />To get good bass and high sound quality you need to get the earphones in correctly.<br />Also, the stock memory foam eartips that came with mine were hard as a rock, ordered some cheap blue cell ones, $6 for 10 eartips, those are very soft and have enhanced my experience with these headphones."
237,5,It is good..
238,4,"Works well but the remote never worked at all.  Not a big deal, I just use the button on the unit itself to switch inputs."
239,5,good
240,3,"Good audio quality and all, but there's too much audio bleed through on the headphones. Might be good at home, but at work or outside in general, wouldn't recommend it."
241,5,"Maximum volume and audio quality is better than I expected, battery performance is very good.Play time up to 7 hours and<br />standby time lasts for over 2 weeks on a full charge."
242,5,great
243,5,"perfect for our large library of movies.  and its size can fit almost anywhere (i.e., under a chair, in and under a cabinet, on a TV stand....  Love it!"
244,5,"These headphones are an awesome value. Luke other reviews have said, the sound quality is not perfect but for $30 and while I am running that's not what I am concerned about. They are light weight, comfortable and stay in place. I love that there are no lose wires to get caught on anything. I have answered a call on them and they worked great, the caller could hear me just fine. The only thing that is a little tricky is locating the multi function button while the rubber sweat proof ring is on it; but the triangular shape helps with that because it is located on one of the points."
245,5,"Great sound, good reception and easy to use."
246,1,"Same as the last pair, one channel quit after a week. It wouldn't cost them 5 cents to improve the connector. ):"
247,4,"It's been working good so far. I bought a big 27 inch external monitor for my MAC and wasn't sure how to connect it. One search on Amazon pointed me to this , bought HDMI cable to go with it and booom now I can enjoy everything on my big screen. Make sure you change audio settings  on your MAC ."
248,5,"After debating whether to drop the money on what I saw as a Beats Solo copy, the pre-order reviews swayed me, and I am thankful they did. The matte rubber finish on the body eliminates the cheap look and feeling of Beats Solos. The cord and design are both well made, sleek, and stylish. One of the thigns I hate about headphones is how I look wearing them, but with these I may or may not slow my walk when passing mirrors, glass plates, or street selfies. Not to mention, they are unbranded which I LOVE. (I hate being a walking billboard).<br /><br />Design and appearance aside, the sound quality was my highest concern and greatest selling point. For the price these headphones offer superb sound and power. I believe they are not pre-mixed to provide a certain ambiance or boost a range, making them ideal for my mixing music at concerts and productions. The bass is powerful, but not bleedy or destructive to the other ranges. The mids and high are remarkably clean in many genres of music. Although I've gone through about five-six headphones known for their sound and not appearance in the past year, with these I still occasionally hear sounds and instruments I hadn't heard before. I could continue, but the point is, they are well worth the money!"
249,1,Fell apart almost immediately - not worth anything.
250,3,Better than the ones they replaced which had fallen apart. These do not attach reliably. Have to reattach them periodically. But they work.
251,5,great product.
252,4,"Bought this as a gift. It's great! Sound quality is excellent!<br /><br />However, 2 small things: the case is giant (I know it's not meant to be a portable or foldable headphone, but still) and the ear pads are quite small. While they fit over my friend's ears just fine - it's a close fit. If he had bigger ears... it'll probably squish them."
253,1,They shorted out within a week. I will not purchase another product from Beats.
254,1,They were nice... for the 30 minutes that they worked and then the right phone went out. Switched out all the cords. Nothing. Waste of money.
255,1,Broke within 5 days of my son wearing them....Do not buy!!
256,5,This is a great product.. Its a must have for your pedals.. And the blue lights look awesome
257,1,"Great speaker.  Too bad Klipsch discontinued this model.  I ordered one it came damaged, I ordered a second it as damaged in the same fashion.  Speakers should be handled with care.  Dropping one could damage the voice coil.  Both of these have evidently been thrown around.  The boxes seemed O.K. but flat dropping the boxes damaged both of the speakers I received.<br /><br />The mounts holding the 8&#34; driver where broken, the speaker was flopping around in the housing.  I returned the first one and the second came in the same way (different serial #'s).  Vann's? FedEx? what ever, broken both times.  I need these for an installation and I have no time and must resort to JB weld.  Be prepared to ship these back or repair with JB weld.  Great sound for a dual voice coil, however, overpriced.  My customer already has Klipsch installed and needs this one for an odd space in the same area."
258,2,The headphones broke the second I put then on. They lasted for literally 5 seconds. However they are comfortable and have nice sound.
259,4,Wrx great
260,5,No complaints
261,5,"Exactly as advertised, built down to .15 Ohms with no problems. Thanks!"
262,4,Works as advertised.
263,5,awesome!!!
264,5,Works good for my 55 inch.
265,5,Excelent!!!...
266,5,Excellent
267,4,"I just purchased and I did have to find out out how to connect to hear the TV and found out that with a att u verse , I connected the audio cables to the att set top box pressed the reset once and received perfect sound but every time I turn on/off I might need to press the scan button to find the right channel. I have walked away up the steps , even to the front door about 20' behind walls and I could still hear clearly. Maybe better instructions would help those thst can't get them work?. As for me, I'm very satisfied."
268,5,"Perfect for burning CDs from iTunes. I know some reviews on here mention some disks failing... I haven't had that issue yet and i've burned 6 disks so far, a few with 27 songs on 1 disk and have had 0 problems... i'm wondering if people are maybe bumping their laptops or messing with other programs that may effect the quality of completion.<br /><br />I tested every single one I burned and every song works the whole way through. I highly recommend this and will be purchasing the DVDs next."
269,5,Great qualite
270,5,Nice product to have..
271,5,works good
272,2,I use this cable to connect a radio to my helmet that I use for paragliding. The cable gets moved around a lot during flight. It only lasted a month before a conductor inside the cable &#34;broke&#34; or otherwise made and &#34;open circuit&#34; from an electrical perspective. I used the exact same cable again and it did the same thing. OK cable if it is going to sit behind your stereo but not good if you are going to be using it for sports.
273,5,Heavy duty HDMI cable bendable too
274,5,Like the ones that came with the unit. Great.
275,5,My child &#34; loves &#34; them .
276,3,Break if your not careful
277,3,one side of headphone went out after 2 months. besides that its great
278,1,"Anker did a great job on this product.<br /><br />I have bought/tried a dozen of bluetooth speaker including those expensive ones form big brand (&#62;$100), in the end, this speaker was the winner (and it is also the cheapest one!).<br /><br />It is very compact, the sound quality is very good and loud for it's size. More importantly, the sound is natural without a lot of processing like some other bluetooth speakers. Battery last a very long time.<br /><br />The micro SD function is what I need and it works great as well. Quality product, 5 stars!<br /><br />Update 20150509<br />=============<br /><br />While the bluetooth connection still functional, the micro SD card function stopped working (not the SD card itself because I tried different micro SD card on the speaker), reduce to one star."
279,5,These batteries hold their charge quite nicely -much better than the other brands I've used over the years.  I use them primarily for xbox 360 and wii controllers and they seem to last much longer on a charge.
280,5,very good^^
281,5,They do the job.
282,5,Works very well as advertised
283,5,Works as described. Very happy.
284,3,"If you find the right position in your ear, it works fine, but it will be tiring after about one hour. Also the position of the little preamp is not convenient, too high, or too low, i can never find the right spot and it is hardwired with a cord that is way too short, and no change or extension is possible to it."
285,5,We are down to 1 remote and the phone.  We use the app less than the remote but.... it is great to have the option.
286,5,All three work perfectly. Thanks.
287,4,"Okay, I was able to buy this product to use in my car for only 1.80$ (free shipping)! I knew when buying that the quality probably wouldn't be great, and it's not bad. The Sound Quality is pretty good, but the cable itself is quite flimsy and feels like might break in the near future. But then again, at less than 2$, who really cares? However, the biggest gripe I had with the product was the delivery time. I ordered right after the New Year (which may have caused the delay, understandably) and the product didn't ship until early February, and then wasn't delivered for another 2 1/2 weeks. All that wait for such a little product (which I admittedly was greatly anticipating for some driving entertainment)? I was debating just going to Walmart/Target and spending 8$ on whatever Aux Cable they were selling (same quality).<br /><br />I would buy again at such a low price, but definitely from a different seller or something."
288,4,Really great multi-function speaker! But don't buy it if you want louder speakers... It's great for a daily soundtrack!
289,4,Be careful what type of mounting screws you use because mine ripped out of the wall.  I used 4X drywall anchors that were rated at 50 lbs each.  Make sure you secure this to a stud no matter what.
290,5,Fast and perfect.  Thank you very much.
291,5,They sound great and affordable
292,5,They work. Comes with a few extras. I will update this review if something happens in the next month or so. But great buy for the price from what I can see.
293,1,"I so wanted to be able to write a good review for this product, but sadly I can't.  First let me say, this radio looks great. And it sounds great, too. But that's where the praise ends. The display is not lit all the time, so when it is dark at night, you can't just look at the clock and see what time it is. Kind of stupid if you ask me. And the USBort, is only to read a thumb drive. IT WILL NOT CHARGE A PHONE, which is beyond me why this is one of the first clocks that comes up when you put &#34;alarm clock with USB charger&#34; into Amazon's search bar. So even though I wanted a cool alarm clock, I returned this in search of another."
294,5,"The original buds for the JayBird BlueBuds X weren't good for me.  The ear pieces would never stay in my ears no matter what.  I tried the silicone ear buds from my other headphones but they didn't help either.  I researched and found these.  These work great.  It does take a bit for the foam pieces to expand and settle in your ears, but it fits snug and I didn't have any problems with it falling it out when working out, smiling, or even eating.  I would not recommend you wearing this while running in the street since it does a really good job of canceling outside noise.  Stay safe!"
295,1,"I love the product....Had another one, which is why I ordered this one.  I just didn't work...Wouldn't turn on..."
296,5,excellent reception and easy to install.
297,5,Peforms as claimed.  I just wish there were more broadcasters in my area.  Performs as well or better than cable.
298,5,Great speakers for the price! Very nice sound. Works well with the PC.
299,4,Seemed good quality.  Gave this as a gift for Xmas.  Looked to be about the right size for a headset but not much room for anything else.
300,5,Great
301,5,Perfect for the job! I did not expect it not to work! Of course C2G has great product always!
302,5,Great replacement works like a charm<br />No problems here<br />Delivered before time<br />Love it
303,4,"This is easy to set up, and very simple.  I would like if we could turn it off, as the LED lights are a bit on the bright side.  Other than than, good stuff!"
304,4,"Works as advertised.  I have not had any problems as reviewed by other users.  Good price, good product.  I did not give a 5 star rating because I am not sure I could ever &#34;love&#34; a DVD case."
305,5,My kid love it to much<br />And also his mom take a pink one from him :D
306,3,"Headphones seems nice, and work well from what I have seen so far. But I am missing accessories from my order.  I received 2 right sports hooks, no lefts.  Looks like others recently have had the same issue by looking at their seller profile page.<br />I would like to keep the headphones and just get the missing accessories."
307,5,bought it for xmas. love the sound
308,3,okay
309,5,Great headphones my wife loves em
310,4,"Works as advertised. The only problem we've had with it was it paired to a Kindle my son had left on instead of the closer device we were trying to pair with.  The only real negative to the speaker is there's no volume control on the speaker itself, so set your volume from your device before you get in the shower :)    Instructions are printed in a 2pt serif font that's very hard to read. They look like they've been reduced from a full page. That said, they aren't hard to figure out."
311,5,Great sound from such a small device.  Very convenient.
312,5,"This screen cleaner is the bomb, no residue left over whatsoever. Comes with an awesome cloth."
313,5,great. Saved me from throwing away my old headset.
314,5,"Nice looking, amazing battery life, great sound quality, perfect for my campings and hiking trails :)"
315,4,The delivery is little late. But the headphone is nice.<br />Purple color is not looks like it. It is more pretty. Pastle purple. I like it.
316,4,"For the price it was I love it. It works like it should, its easy to set up and use, and it suits our needs perfectly. Of course you are not going to get top dollar sound quality in this price bracket but thats not to say that it is not good. Its worth its money and is good quality stuff"
317,5,ALL EXCELLENT
318,5,i cant hear you over the awesomness of my speakers.
319,5,"I've purchased these style earbuds for about 6-7 years now. While the shape changes, the classic, no remote earbuds, always last a good year or two with no malfunctions."
320,5,Really good compliment to a 7 inch tablet with great long battery life.
321,4,"I like it. I just can't figure out how to make the screen brighter. if someone could help me, i would appreciate it. Other than that little issue, i really like it."
322,4,Good for archiving DVD's and CD's.
323,4,"Really awesome speaker with great, consistent sound. I use it in the shower every day! Two criticisms (but honestly the speaker was worth it despite these): battery life could be better (only lasts me 4-5 hours) and it could be louder (I like my morning music super loud and this is just barely there). If you can live with that, definitely buy it!"
324,5,Good replacement for lost remote.
325,5,The best rechargeable I know. Hold double as long as my old ones. Great offer!
326,5,Met my expectations
327,4,"Easy to use. Music with bass causes the device to rattle and distort, but that is not surprising given its size. Otherwise, great and fills large rooms with sounds."
328,4,download is very fast
329,5,👍👍👍👍
330,5,"Record player arrived in time for Christmas, was easy to use, and had good sound."
331,5,I love it
332,5,well good
333,5,the aux cord is just as it shows the shipping was awesome I have no complaints about the product nor the seller
334,3,Decent quality for its price
335,4,buen producto
336,5,Got these for my 8 year old son to use at school. He says they sound good and fit him well.
337,5,Great price. Very sturdy and well made. Also pretty good instructions if needed.
338,5,"Works great, bought for length works with HDTV OK......"
339,1,The speaker is great but the cover tore up when I was putting on the speaker the zipper came apart.  speaker 5 stars
340,1,This product did not fit my ROKU 3. I sent it back immediately and just ordered one from ROKU.
341,5,Not extremely big and true sound!
342,4,Clean sound
343,3,not fit well
344,5,great product works and looks as advertised this product is a win great deal and very durable
345,4,"Made the connection, just like I needed it to."
346,1,"I have built some speakers using the same or similar BMR drivers that are in these speakers so I had high hopes as I thought the DSP tech in these would make them sound even more amazing than my own designs. Honestly, they sound as good as a $10 bluetooth speaker or as good as my Mac's built in speakers. Also, these are sold individually, not in pairs making the price for performance crazy. Yes, I tried different amps and sources etc. I even listened to them side by side with other good speakers as I was in shock at how empty and weak they performed."
347,5,"I'm an audio snob! With the exception of one that was five times the price of this one, all of the ones I demo'd were trying too hard to compensate for the fact that it is a little speaker that physically cannot move the same quantity of air as a very large speaker. At only $45, this speaker has a quality sound. It isn't danceable and isn't for home theater, but it works very well in the kitchen or for listening to podcasts in the garage. The battery life is exceptional!"
348,5,Works as advertised. Just changed TV service providers in our condo and the new Direct TV unit needed an HDMI port. Got this cable so my DVD player and Roku box can share the remaining port.
349,4,"It was much easier to setup/calibrate than my last receiver (Onkyo TX-NR616)<br /><br />I have tested it with gaming, 3d movies, regular movies, tv. All work out well."
350,1,"I will say that using this speaker is very easy. You don't need to be an expert to make the connections. However, I am terribly disappointed in the quality. Just 1 star from me."
351,4,Works as expected.
352,1,Came broken
353,5,Exactly what we were looking for
354,4,worked like I expected
355,5,Easy to get hooked up to my laptop and iPhone and great sound quality. Buying more as christmas gifts
356,5,Great headphones. The clarity and crisp sound that I get with these headphones are day and night from other headphones. I also love the fact that these headphones do not get tangled no matter if you even put them in your pocket. Great headphones.
357,5,Best price to keep the sound booth at church supplied.
358,4,mounted 24 inch tv no problem
359,5,great money saver.
360,5,My husband loves this receiver. It apparently upscales picture quality which is a bonus. Our tv shows and movies look better than ever.
361,2,"Seems well-enough built, but the audio quality is truly horrid."
362,2,Get a mount that has the back wall plate already in one piece. Assembly was annoying
363,4,i placed it in my ninetendo game and game comes on for a few minutes and than turn off
364,4,Totally as on picture. no complaint
365,2,"meh.  for the price i was expecting a great deal more from this unit.  it's plenty loud to use in my home gym (unlike the tv speakers) but the sound is overly bright, jarring, jagged, and overdone.  the total lack of controls to balance this is deeply disappointing in a product this price.  some of this may be subjective.  if you like the rotel amp bw speaker type &#34;british&#34; sound, this unit may bother you less, but i find it to be unsatisfying, brash, overly detailed, and incohensive.  the &#34;harman&#34; mode basically works like a &#34;loudness&#34; button and makes all the imperfections far more intense.<br /><br />it's easy to set up and easy to synch to your tv remote (though the lack of on screen info like volume level etc is a serious omission).<br /><br />this is not a great product at all.<br /><br />to use while doing cardio, it's tolerable, but this has ZERO business in a living room or home theater."
366,4,"The switch works ok, but sometimes it does not recognize which of the devices is on and I need to walk over and press the button. I made sure to put only one frequently used device in the switch, so it does not happen too often. The switch does not heat up during work, and looks solid. The cord is thick, but still flexible. I have it wrapped around the TV arm and have FireTv stick in it, which heats up quite a lot - that way it is suspended in the air and can somewhat cool itself."
367,5,Withstands a beating. My niece is wild
368,1,"I was excited for this to arrive to set up my dual monitors.  I have a Vista desktop and it only has ISB 2.0 ports.  Warning, I learned if that is the case, the maximum display you can get is 800 x 600.  The biggest problem is when moving programs or closing programs they never disappear from the screen.  On top of that, the flicker is really distracting.  I tried to connect it to my windows 7 laptop and that crashed 3 times when I tried to extend the desktop.  It will show a duplicate of the screen, but the resolution was at 800 x 600 also.  So far a very poor product.  Don't waste your money."
369,5,Great product great price
370,1,"Product arrived with no problems, but the installation was a disaster. Three of the six supports broke during installation - the torque required to thread the screw through the shaft of the plastic support arm broke the collar where the head of the screw supports the speaker.  I have installed other similar products with identical support systems and have never had problems. This product was returned to the vendor."
371,5,"works like a charm, no issues!!!"
372,5,"Not only did the Nano show up a day before Amazon estimated, but its a great refurbished product. It showed up with everything intact. Apple makes great products and Square Deals was cheap and easy to use. I would recommend using them and I will be buying more from them in the future. Expect great things from Square deals, Dave & Jessica you guys rock!"
373,5,My 10-yr-old Jason Kipnis fan thinks these are sweet ... and they are pretty cool if you're an Indians fan. They work great for her with the interchangeable bud pads and the logo is authentic. Sound comes through great. She gave them a thumbs up. Mom approves.
374,1,Broke a few days after I got them
375,4,no signal was all I got from these cables<br />these people will do everything to make it right for you
376,5,"Well worth the money. Bluetooth works easily and the shark produces a very nice sound. Loud enough for sitting around or in a golf cart, but won't necessarily work for the main sound at a party."
377,1,I would've given it 3 stars if it cost like 5 bucks. For $30 you can buy a decent player and for that money it's better to just listen to your smartphone. Battery life non-existent. I bought it for less than $10 and I feel like a fool to have thrown this money out the window. Can't even give it to anyone.
378,5,Yup.  It's what it appears to be.  Battery draws down quickly when using with a bluetooth speaker.
379,3,"I finally made the step to hang up my flat screen and I wanted it to be as close to the wall as possible. The frame has decent quality but the hardware was terrible. My apartment has plaster walls so I had to go to the nearest hardware store to pick up some wall anchors and bolts. I ended up using none of the provided hardware, except for the screws to hold the TV up. If you have plaster or drywall, just spend a few extra bucks on a good metal wall anchor. You only need 1-2 and it provides much more security. I really like the full range of motions but like others mentioned, the arm tilts and unlevels the TV. I also found this for much cheaper, around $18, after I hooked it up."
380,3,its ok
381,5,Just the right size and price!
382,5,Great price and works well.
383,4,Did not use it.
384,3,This toll usually didn't work to extract pins.  Not sure what the issue was.
385,5,My exercise routine has kicked up a notch now that I don't worry about my ear buds falling out of my ears. I love it.
386,3,Pretty easy to use but the quality of the video from the tv to the computer isn't the best. It's bearable but the quality could be way better.
387,5,Great battery for a great price.
388,4,"Ok short and sweet:<br /><br />Cons: the plastic its made with reflects a little around the sides when you're playing.<br />they could be a bit more comfy for the price you pay but to each their own with head sizes.<br /><br />Pros: out of the box to playing first game was like 15 minutes set was a breeze and went flawlessly.<br />Everything works fine the glasses intigrated with my in built IR emiter in my monitor ect<br />My first words when playing something in 3d for the first time (crysis 3) were oh my god, and so were my girlfriends.<br /><br />In summary compare seeing a movie in 2d to seeing one in 3d... did you like that? then get these glasses for your 3d monitor, i did and i wouldnt do it any differently.<br /><br />PS if anyone from amazon reads this just would like to say i LOVE your site, it was supposed to arrive friday and i went downstairs and found it somehow arrived wednesday lol! also you have the most amazing customer service and prices, even though i live in Australia I always come you to guys first to see if you have what i need &#60;3"
389,5,"I've had these for over a year now, use them almost daily at work. Good fit in-ear. Have a sound quality that will satisfy the majority of users.<br /><br />The cord is a little shorter than I would have liked for my usage (plugged into a floor-placed desktop PC), but the length is advertised and that is my own fault.<br /><br />Hold strongly in ear, seals well, easily to clean."
390,4,Great sound. I wish you could visually see the volume increase/decrease on the TV screen.
391,2,nice looking picks... but are made very cheap... where down very fast... after a few hrs. of playing with them the pick is almost round... lose there tip very fast...  not worth the money i paid...
392,2,"I have owned this unit for about 2 months. When the internet portion works it's great. The problem is that for the 2nd time, the network settings were not retained by the unit. I called Onkyo and was told that since the unit is under warranty, they will repair it for free.<br />The problem I have is that the buyer has to pay to ship the item to the mfgr. even though it's under warranty. The amounts top approximately $60. In my opinion this should not be the case.<br /><br />When a product of this alleged quality malfunctions early in the ownership period, I question the overall quality of the product. Additionally, when the buyer has to pay part of the cost of warranty repair, it eliminates my desire to purchase anything else from Onkyo."
393,5,"I handle small-scale IT and audio/visual for higher-end residential and SMB clientele and I've tried literally every budget indoor amplified antenna under the sun (RCA, RadioShack, Antenna's Direct, AntennaCraft, etc. etc.) and I've found that the curve 30 just simply works better out-of-the-box more often, in more places. Solid product thus far. This includes a couple clients in areas where colleagues of mine told me they tried all kinds of non-amplified and amplified antennas and nothing really worked that well... So take it for what it's worth, but yeah, if I were a cable company, I'd want this thing taken off the market ASAP. LOL. Well done Mohu!"
394,5,Cheap and easy install. Mounted a 32&#34; lcd in about 15 minutes after unboxing
395,1,"I purchased this a year ago. Trusting that it is good, I used it just 2 days ago for the first time only to find out that it is defective and out of warranty. So frustrating. A waste of money. A good lesson not to trust easily on a product but to test it upon receipt."
396,5,"good, i'm satisfied."
397,5,"Works great! I have two so one stays in my travel bag. This speaker allows me to listen to music or tv without bothering my husband at night. It slips right under my pillow, without the cover, and I can hear everything quite clearly!"
398,5,"I bought this to view internet video on my large flat screen TV.  It works beautifully.  I plugged it's input into the monitor output port on my Dell Inspiron One (Windows 7 Ultimate with Service Pack 1) and into the headphone jack, and it's output into an HDMI input port on my TV.  Then I used the Windows multi-monitor function to extend my desktop onto the TV.  Then, whatever video I want to watch, I move the player (e.g. browser) window onto the TV, maximize it, and set it to full-screen display.  My only complaint is that the audio input cable is a little short (8&#34; plus connector), so it barely reaches the headphone port on the Inspiron without an extension cable.  With my setup the sound comes out of both the computer and TV speakers.  If the audio jack is unplugged I get static hum on the TV (of course);  otherwise, picture and sound are excellent.  Excellent function for a very reasonable price."
399,1,A FRAUD1. OHLY ONE BATTERY SUPPLIED. BUT TWO ILLUNSTRATED&#62;  ILLINSTATION SHOULD SAY ONE .I&#34;LL NEVER BUY FROM SUPPLIER AGAIN&#62;
400,4,great
401,4,works ok
402,1,Too cheaply made.
403,5,Worked perfectly as a replacement for the monitor power supply that became defective due a power outage.  Inexpensive.
404,5,Very happy with this product. The box arrived in very good condition. My husband didn't have any problems putting it together and it is held up nicely. We have had it for over a year now and it has definitely gotten some abuse my granddaughters would definitely recommend this product.
405,1,"This antenna is extremely over priced in comparison to the quality, even though it's only $30. I wouldn't advise the purchase of this product."
406,5,"Got this for a Dv6 1259dx , it works , price is right"
407,5,excellent
408,5,Works as advertised.
409,5,"Arrived on time, love the sound"
410,5,"I've been looking into different Bluetooth speakers for months now and either I had to pick a cheap speaker with crappy sound or an expensive speaker with good sound. I tried looking for even a mediocre speaker at the $100 price but was unhappy with what I could find. I bought this during an amazon lightning deal for $75 and it was probably the best money I've ever spent. The bass is just right with clear and crisp sound that even sounds great in the outdoors. Sound filled the room and there was no distortion at max volume and it can get very loud.Calls with the speakerphone feature sounded clear both ways and it's very light and portable. Also, at loud volumes it held a very good battery. I would say the sound is as good as if not better than the beats pill xl. Extremely happy with this and I would highly recommend it. Even at its regular price at $120 it's still a tremendous value."
411,5,"This setup worked great for my tailgating.<br /><br />The instructions are great and easy to follow.  It has everything you need except for the TV, satellite box and extension cord.<br /><br />The carrying case works well, and I modified it to keep my remote inside.<br /><br />This is a good deal for an all-in-one tailgating satellite experience"
412,5,"I love the size !, and the battery consumption is so low, it lasts  me at least a week and a half maybe more with constant playing. the sound is really good too.<br />and it holds alot of music, with choices of playing by the album, and playing a mixture from what you have on there.<br />I do love this choice I made"
413,4,Purchased a second one for my hard of hearing dad.  Works we'll and we bring one along when we travel.
414,5,Very nice.  The glasses work perfectly..!!
415,3,"Advertised as having a \\""Lifetime Warranty\\"", this item stopped working entirely after two months of use. No info whatsoever on how to use the Lifetime Warranty for a replacement. Vendors own response indicates they don't know the specifics of the Lifetime Warranty. Got a response from the company, but it would have been nice to have the info on how included somewhere in the order info. Oddly, worked great before it mysteriously stopped responding to any input or even turning on."
416,1,"This antenna is very weak, and only picks up the strongest signals. Check the networks in your area that have OTA transmission before you buy. Anything less than perfect will not be picked up by this antenna."
417,5,great item .
418,5,"These have been the best rechargeable batteries I ever purchased. They are fast recharging, hold their charge very well, and supply good current. I don't think Amazon sells them anymore.  I've tried many brands but these are still the best I've purchased."
419,5,"exactly what I was looking for, works great!"
420,4,Well made and easy to use as well as reasonably priced.<br />Would gladly order form this company again.
421,5,This is excellent so far. We got lots of channels at our cabin with using this antenna. Hoping it holds up as some of it is made out of plastic so not sure what the weather will do to it. But so far we love it. Crystal clear picture on the TV which we did not have before mounting this on the roof. Would definitely recommend.
422,5,Great device and seller.
423,4,This quite a handy little gadget. I use it in my classroom. The only thing I miss is having a list of songs for each CD. I was able to use the online program to list the title to each CD and print it to fit the little trey. It was easy to use and print from.
424,5,"Works great, video and audio.  Does its job well.  Have been using this for 3 years with no problems."
425,5,It works great
426,5,I use it all the time! great buy
427,5,Get the job done.
428,5,good
429,1,I couldn't make it work.
430,5,I love it
431,4,House hasn't burned down yet!
432,4,Works very well
433,2,It is cute but it doesn't really have more or better sound than my girlfriends phone speaker.
434,5,Love it! The dialog enhancement works wonderful and the no blaring at commercials is a welcome relief.<br />This is in a large room so I have added a sub to give some real punch... Overall better natural sound than bose and other systems
435,1,the alarm and setting it sucks
436,5,"It worked Ok for what I use it for,"
437,5,good goods
438,2,"Product was clearly used before.  Both the solar panel and display screens were very heavily scratched when I received it.  The rubber was peeling away from the display in the upper right corner.  Not sure if it was returned or refurbished but very disappointed.<br /><br />Outside of that, the product seems to pick up radio stations fine.  I haven't had a sunny day in the couple of days since I've had it but I'll be testing the solar charging when I get a sunny day."
439,2,"When I use this adapter to listen to music on my phone in my car, I hear static and a high pitched whining noise over my car speakers."
440,5,"This is a great mount.  Easy to install, and works great for a ~20lb LED TV.  I hung a 48 inch Vizio and it works and looks great."
441,5,Very los price!
442,5,The system is awesome!
443,3,"Failed today 10/11/2014.  Purchased in January 2012.<br /><br />Router LEDS began to strobe, and when unplugged and plugged back in, the power LED just blinked rapidly.<br /><br />I BELIEVE the device is stuck in continual rebooting due to lack of sufficient power, but don't have a working plug to test to see if the router is still functional."
444,5,Exactly what I needed.
445,5,Kids have loved these for their school needs.  I bought three pairs (different colors).  They have a volume control (look for the small cord included in package) and plug it in.  Easy to assemble.  Each of my kids must have a pair for school use and they keep them in a zip lock.  So far so good (2 months).  They seem sturdy and are comfortable to wear (better than the ear buds that kids can't fit into their ears and they always fall out).  No complaints from the kids!  Although they're pricey - totally worth the money.
446,5,Outstanding for the price.
447,5,Working as expected.
448,5,Inexpensive and work without problems
449,5,I truly appreciate the headphone stand.  It looks expensive and others have asked where did I buy it.  I couldn't beat the price!!
450,1,"I bought this to try and fix a problem with our TV. It didn't fix the problem.  When I went to return it, I was told that $5.22 would be deducted from shipping. Which means I'd get $1 back. What a rip off."
451,5,"Went without cable for a while and this antenna was badass. Even after I got cable back, I still think some of the HD channels were better using this antenna than via cable."
452,4,good!
453,5,"Wow. These headphones are fantastic! Crystal-clear high-quality sound. Same-day delivery for $5.99 with Amazon Prime membership. I am extremely pleased with these Bose headphones, and I will update this review in the future if anything changes. I lost my last set of Bose headphones, like a real dumb bunny, the ones I got as a birthday present. So I'm not going to lose these."
454,5,Excellent quality.
455,5,Solid Sound & Rugged for outdoor usage. Battery life is also good.
456,5,Gr8 sound and price.
457,5,Thank you.
458,1,Oh. Turtle speed for shipping. Take me 3 weeks.
459,5,"was perfect and works great, quick delivery"
460,5,Worked great in Sydney.
461,5,"is very util, i am using to conect my tablet to my pc screen or my laptop"
462,5,Great buy!
463,5,"I have used one of these as a phono preamp for about 3 years.  Of course I put in better tubes.  Now, first off, this takes a high end moving coil just fine and even takes a medium output moving coil fine if your per-amp has several gain settings, like the Rogue, or you don't need to play loudly, or if you just turn it's volume all the way up.  So I am using a medium output Ortophon MC cartridge and really like the sound.<br /><br />Recently I decided to replace my $3000 pre-amp with this as a regular pre-amp.  It was an experiment.  I changed to some better power chords and put in GE 5 Star 12AU7 tubes (inexpensive tube at about $25 each).  I have to say, while the soundstage might have decreased just a little, the sound is beautifully sweet, musical, and clear.  I am sure I would get back the sound staging with Telefunken tubes for example, but the sound is so sweet and clear, and I am enjoying it so much, that I can't see making that change.<br /><br />This unit is truly an exceptional bargain.  There are better for $3000+, but I am not sure there are any for less then that.<br /><br />By the way, yes the front turntable connectors mean you need longer wires if you want the front facing you, but it is a small price to pay and frankly doesn't bother me at all."
464,5,Perfection.
465,1,"Garbage headphones, left ear bud stopped working 2 months after buying these so now I cant return them according to the Amazon return policy.  DO NOT BUY!!!"
466,5,great
467,5,Great deal!  I have ordered these several times and have had no issues other than one single battery had a little corrosion on it.
468,1,This did not work for me.  I bought the wrong adapter for my SSD drive.
469,1,Didn't work for me.  Too small.  Returned it.
470,5,"they fit nice and have good quality sound, I noticed it works great on my TV when I play video games or watching movies. The bass is awesome! When I tried it on my mp3 player I had to adjust the equalizer on my player to make the sound quality better so be prepared to do that with yours. When I tried using it on my laptop the sound was Meh but I would recommend this to anyone who has a TV with a earphone jack, the cord is a nice length too so you can sit back or lay down."
471,5,worked great on my recent trip to south africa and namibia--loved the 3 outlets..  small and effective ..  a great buy
472,3,"This antenna works well.  It is directional, so it has to be pointed in the right direction. Fortunately, all of my stations seem to be in the same direction, so I can get everything without having to reorient the antenna for different stations.  The biggest issue is the fact that the item as illustrated is for the UHF signals only.  If you also want the VHF signals (stations 2-13), the telescoping rabbit ears must be deployed.  They are shown retracted on the left side of the unit.  The photo is deceptive.  It should show the unit with the two rabbit ears extended.  As other reviewers have noticed, the unit is not very stable.  One bump to the table that it's on and it tips over."
473,5,Excellent mount for the price. Works great and easy to install.
474,4,"Great Clock, works great, fast delivery thank you."
475,3,"After reading other reviews I was hesitant about purchasing this clock because of the brightness of the display but thought it wouldn't be an issue. Well, it is. It is very bright even on the dimmest setting and lights up the whole room. I don't understand why there isn't a function to turn the display off completely. It isn't needed when the time is projected on the ceiling. It would also be nice if the time could flip in other directions. I like that it flips back and forth but if it could be turned to the side it would be nice too. It's small and doesn't take up much room on our nightstand. But if it's bumped at all the projection gets lost. I've considered returning it but haven't yet. I do like the temperature display and when the projection is in the right place it is easy to read. Even my husband who is practically blind without his glasses can make out the time."
476,5,Awesome just as good if not better than leading brands
477,5,Received in excellent condition and works great with TV. No problems with using. Very happy with product.
478,3,"its good, but i wanted more...."
479,5,it worked very well  first time . i give it a five star right off the bat.
480,1,does not work junk!!
481,5,Great Sony Quality
482,5,My JBL L110 speakers sound like I just bought them back in 1980... awesome speaker foam kit and easy to install. Many thanks to Simply Speakers for the fast service.
483,4,Good sound quality and light weight.  The only issue is that the cords are made of a cheap material so it's easy to tangle and fustrating to un ravel (they ravel VERY easily).
484,5,Delivery was quick and the cable was exactly what I needed to connect my PC to a monitor. I'm totally satisfied.
485,5,"The ProMonitor 1000 sounds great.  I was positively surprised.  Full, deep, sound with rich lows and bright highs (2-ch, music through Pandora).  They are a bit bigger than what I had expected, and they are quite heavy.  The white finish is more of a bone, almost almond, hue than cool white.  I have these paired with a DT ProCenter 2000 through a Denon AVR-X amp.  I have yet to connect the DT ProSub, but I'm pretty happy even as it is, playing music.  For movies and such, I am confident the ProSub will add more shake and rumble.  It's my first venture with DT products and I'm impressed.  I like and appreciate a good system/combo, but wouldn't call myself an audiophile.  Yet, I feel like I landed the right combo this time."
486,5,Love it!  Works perfectly and my husband can now hear every word on TV.
487,3,"Sound is really good, but it is more complicated to program than the radio alarm that it replaced.  It is a good product."
488,4,"Works very well in good, strong and direct sun light. Any shadow or clouds and no go! Liked the spray head choices. I wish it came with more tubes, but had extra from another unit we had, but did not use. We have it in a deep clay pot in our front yard as a water feature. Nice sound, not too load when sitting on the front porch and taking.  Very good for the price."
489,5,Worked Perfectly
490,4,I received the 3 remotes I ordered in a timely fashion. The picture depicting the remote changed after placing my order. Fortunately I received the model I was hoping to get. The 3 remotes were individually boxed. They did show a little wear as though they were used or abused during packaging. They all programmed without issue. The price of each was attractive. I'd recommend the product to anyone.
491,5,Super loud !!! My husband loves it
492,1,No bueno
493,3,They sound ok for something mounted in the back of a pickup. The screws do not stay tight without being modified or glued on.
494,5,They work well.
495,5,Ok Product
496,5,"Great batteries,  bought for my digital camera.  The batteries don't discharge sitting in the camera like other batteries."
497,1,I was really not impressed with the ipod. It looks really old and is big and bulky not at all like the sleek look it gives off. And the firewire is impossible to find now. I tried many stores and did not have luck as its so outdated.
498,1,Worked great for about 1 week.  Then stopped.  Said it was not compatible with my device that it previously worked with.  iPhone 4s.  Useless to me now .  Doesn't charge and can not listen to music.
499,5,"Good quality, works as expected"
500,5,Everything went very well.  Product and delivery all excellent.
501,4,very good radio.Gets alot of stations and good sound for the price;)
502,5,Wonderful! I am so glad I've found earbuds that didn't break after a month.
503,5,"This cable was ordered to make full use of the video outputs of the EGVA Geforce GTX760,  It has given great service for surround displays since I received it.  Highly recommend it for any adapter that has the DisplayPort to provide a second HDMI source for your monitors."
504,5,Excellent tapes. Thank you so much.  You can tape so much more music on a Maxell UR 120 tapes.  At least seventeen songs on each side; as opposed to 11 or 12 songs you can record on each side on Maxell UR 90 tapes. (45 minutes on each side)<br /><br />Once again - Thank you so much.
505,1,"One side works, one side doesn't.  Kind of defeats the purpose of having a splitter, don't ya think?"
506,5,satifisfied
507,3,I returned the antenna as it did not improve my TV reception. I purchased another antenna which was satisfactory.
508,4,It helped but I don't think people can hear me well.
509,1,It worked for 3 charges & quit working. It shows a full charge but won't send a charge to the phone.  Tried 3 different charging cords to be sure.<br />I WOULD NOT RECOMEND THIS DEVICE!
510,5,This thing has saved me soooo much money. This is the greatest thing in the world to have if you are constantly have to switch cables. The best thing is the remote control. Its out of view but you can still control it. Fantastic piece of equipment.
511,4,"It works very well, but I keep hitting the day light savings time button on the back when I try to dim it to black.  Both are great features, but my fingers get confused at night.  Good small size."
512,5,Outstanding cable!
513,5,Great
514,5,Probably one of the best investments I could have gotten. Glad it can control my WD TV. The first time I've use only one remote in a long time.
515,3,the sound is awesome and if you have small ears don't get these cause people have to have big ears for these
516,4,"great power and battery endurance. it you have a very discerning ear, the sound is low end to mid-range ...not much on the treble end.  I really enjoy it even in the car (not that great with top down). Thus far (2 mos.) great product for the $"
517,5,This cable is exactly what I was looking for.
518,4,"I have tried heaps of &#34;sports&#34; headphones. These sounds good for overt the ear,  nothing mind blowing but good enough during a workout or run. Comfortable and stable fit even when sprinting.  Overall a good set."
519,5,"Yes, they have bass.<br /><br />These are some serious kicking earphones and deserve the moniker 'explosive'. You know when you're at a concert, and the bass is pumping so hard that your chest vibrates along with the beat? I was listening to 'Crown on the Ground' by Sleigh Bells on these 'phones and it was somewhat disconcerting because it seemed like chest should be vibrating along with the deep, deep bass I was hearing, but it was just these earphones delivering the bass to my ears. Incredible!<br /><br />I suppose they might over-emphasize the bass on some tracks, but they are really quite clear overall - I have heard new nuances in the high and mid-range on some tracks, so they're definitely not muddy."
520,3,"Worked for a bit, but I might've broke them."
521,5,cheap and does it's job
522,4,you cannot beat the sound for the price.... great highs and deep lows... i only bought them to compare with my inkd these actually sound as good or better....
523,5,"I was using a &#34;Clear-TV&#34; antenna outside in 100 degree weather, afraid it would melt so I got this. Exceptional performance, amplified signals bring in the clearest Free-Air TV signals ever.... Great Reception too....!"
524,2,"bought this in 2012 and now its dead, won't charge anymore."
525,5,Whoa I've had these for almost a year already... much better than my usual track record.<br /><br />Quality headphones. They show almost no sign of wear after 9 months even after heavy daily use and being haplessly wrapped and and stuffed in pockets.<br /><br />Soft earpieces rarely slip off like some lesser quality products.
526,5,"It is exactly what you think it is . . . a box that blasts music. Medium to high sound quality (bass is the first to distort at high volumes), great look, and very rugged. I owned a previous version of this guy, and it took a beating. Water damage, being dropped, heat, cold .... it lasted three years of partying, camping, pools, hot tubs, and general fun.<br /><br />At this price point, I recommend."
527,1,Waste don't get
528,5,Just what I needed
529,5,great
530,5,"I love love love it, Its so much fun at small gatherings  its great for working outside or the beach"
531,5,It verry good love it
532,4,"So what do you do when there's a trip to China in a few days and your from the US? You try to find adapters that are affordable and wont kill you when you plug them in. These do the job they are supposed to do. They safely change your US plug into a China plug. NO this does not convert voltage or wattage So please do not assume they do, they just change the plug style. Simple. Easy and Affordable. But wait there's more...Not only do you get one plug...You get Two!!! I really like these, so if you need an adapter, pick these up."
533,5,"Works as intended. I have a hard case on my Iphone I noticed that other cables I have used require me to remove my case for them to go in far enough.  Not these, they work great!  No complaints or problems.  I am very happy!"
534,4,Served my purpose.
535,1,Came with a cracked screen/returned
536,5,EXCELLENT EARBUDS! EXCELLENT SOUND/BASS!
537,4,"For how cheap these are, they sound great. I keep them at work so I don't have to travel with (and forget) headphones. They fit in my ears great, too. Better than my more expensive buds. I rate these 800 out of 861."
538,2,"This product was delivered March 29, 2014, and today July 13, 2014, it has burnt out.  Less that four month with average to slightly higher than average use (kids are home since it's summer), but I still would expect this to last longer than the 3.5 months that it did."
539,5,Works just like it is supposed to. An excellent solution to a common problem.
540,5,Excelent
541,5,"Use this to keep my Bluetooth device in, when not in use.  Keeps it safe and easy to find in my bag."
542,5,Needed to replace those broken hubs from CD DIGI-PAKS!
543,1,Did not work with the Bose Lifestyle V35.
544,3,I haven't used it yet.  After I ordered it I found out it was the sensor in the TV that caused the problem.  I am keeping it in case one is needed.
545,5,I had a Bixolon receipt printer that only lasted a year.  This Epson printer is the real deal.  It is made well and works much better than expected.  The printer actually cuts the receipt for you so that you don't have to tear it off yourself.  I wish that I would have spent the extra money on this receipt printer to begin with.
546,1,"This headset is many things and while the sound quality is reasonable for the price, the indescribably short battery life could even be dealt with if it weren't that the design can not be. They will /not/, under any circumstances, stay in my ears for more then about 5 minutes. I can not run with these, I can not sit still and watch TV, heck, I can't even /lay/ still! They will always fall out. And yes, I've tried with and without the wingtips that are designed to keep it in your ear, I've tried with all the different sizes of silicone ear buds that it comes with, nothing changes.<br /><br />I'm not saying that you shouldn't buy this headset, everyone's ears are different, mine are on the small side, just be aware that there may be a high chance of these not fitting right."
547,5,Everything went as planned. No hassles.
548,4,"I purchased these buds to use primarily with my cell phone. They worked great once I figured out that my phone needed to be on speaker. Other wise, trouble free."
549,4,"Bought these for my starting-to-be-hard-of-hearing hubby so that we don't have to crank the TV so loud that I'm blasted away. I thought he'd fight me on this, but he LOVES them...and he's fussy on quality.  I'm so glad."
550,5,"I don't typically write reviews, so this is a rare occasion.<br /><br />These are light and have very good quality of the sound. They hold steady when I move around the gym or run. They feel sturdy enough. They are very small - fit in my pocket easily. They are &#34;street style&#34; in a sense that you can control volume and hear pretty well what happens around you. Lot of competition headphones served as ear-plugs and even when no music was on at all I had hard time hearing anything when walking on the street. Didn't experience any fatigue wearing them while working. Totally recommending and buying another set for my father.<br /><br />The only con that I noticed was the microphone seemed not as great as people complained about hearing me well when I used it for a phone call. But that is a non-issue for me personally."
551,5,good
552,5,"We all know verbatim is the best. Verbs are the best,I never have a error or &#34;coaster&#34;. These play in every machine I have and they play flawlessly.  These are the Bentley of black discs"
553,5,"Battery is great, and very prompt delivery.  It is working very good.  I love to recommend this product to friends & family."
554,5,This product was received as expected and works as advertised. My research surrounding competing products was well worth the time. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for this exact solution.
555,5,Just as advertised.  I had tried other random AC adapters that I had around the house and even the ones that seemed to fit wouldn't light up the charging light.  This one worked great.
556,1,It was broken after one month. (no sound coming out)<br />Sent it back on 12/19/13. It is June 2014 now. didn't get any replacement and no response from the Jlab!
557,5,I love these earbuds! They are small so they actually fit in my ears and the sound quality is great! I have 2 pairs.
558,5,These are the best earphones for the price without question. I bought then because of the price but have been very pleased with the quality of sound and the noise cancelling ability. I use them principally at home since they are too large for travel. Great Bargain.
559,5,"I have to wear these clips bc regular ear buds forever pop out of my ears. These work great, wore them for my half marathon and had no problems with sweat, buds falling out of place, or sound quality."
560,5,This Wall Mount works perfect for Samsung 45 inch TV which we have wall mounted through our 20 year old entertainment center in the front.  It has rigt long arm and does everything what is described.
561,4,"If your looking for the best, why are you reading this review? These are in expensive, rather sturdy so they'll survive my laptop backpack, and the sound they put out is very good considering the price. They are comfortable and lightweight and come in blue! If you pay more than fifty bucks for a set of headphones, your not my kinda people and your sneakers cost 300 bucks. I drive a Chevy and it's not a Corvette but it looks good, works well, and is inexpensive enough I could save up for my Vette, if I wanted one, which I don't.  These are very reasonable and won't hurt your ears on the inside or outside."
562,5,"Hmmm....where to start.  I am kinda a tech-head.  I love technology.  I kept debating whether or not to purchase this product.  Why do I need an amplifier for my headphones?  I already crank it to the point where people can hear my music 5 feet away with my headphones on.  But the more I reasoned with myself, the more I want this device.<br /><br />It has some cool functionality.  So now I can crank up the tunes louder....but surprisingly, I don't.  The sounds through this device is incredibly crisp and punctual.  That's really the only way I can put it.  I actually end up listening to the music at a more moderate level, which tends to bring out the highs and lows.  I no audio aficionado, I just know what I like to hear.  My musical taste range dramatically from techno-indie to pop to 70's rock.  Personally, I think this device bring out the &#34;flavors&#34; in the music.<br /><br />Yes, the device is an amplifier.  And yes, I've played with the volume.  Yes it will turn up very loud, to the point of taking the headphones off and hearing the music crystal clear.  The one major fact in this product is that even at its loudest  setting, the music is still crystal clear, without any distortion.  I also liked the fact that I could hook this up to my computer and be used as a separate sound card.  Works great for that.  I hooked it up to my Surface Pro 2, using Windows 8 and it recognized the device right away and selected as my main sound device...no issues.<br /><br />Very happy with this purchase.  Yes, it's somewhat of a techno-toy....but it truly does what it says....it produces good sound quality and amplifies the sound.  Hopefully in the future, FIIO will come up with a more robust equalizer to customize your listening experience even more."
563,4,"For the Couch Potato who has everything... a Raspberry PI remote!  In the time/space realm of time-wasting, this is really the tops, the Cadillac of time wasting tweaks.  The lawn could be mowed, there is gardening to do... taxes...  but no, it's more satisfying to spend 15 hours tweaking the Raspberry PI so that your *remote* works with it.  The Openelec OS handles it out of the box, but the needed tools are under RaspBMC... the Delorian of the Raspberry PI world.  I2C is the driver that makes this gem work... then plan on spending the next 10 hours messing with various permutations of lircd.conf.  What could you have done with that time?  Written the Great American Novel... watched 20 reruns of &#34;I Dream Of Genie&#34; ... but would all that satisfy you like a marathon MCE Remote hacking session?"
564,5,"I got my DREX61IP today and so far I'm very much satisfied with it. The sound quality is great for its price.<br /><br />I use it on my Xperia Z1, and the only button that's working is the middle one for play/pause. (But it's okay, since it's originally made for iDevices)"
565,4,"i'm a moron for not seeing that before.  also - if you are geeky and want glass, this is plastic fiberoptic.  &#60;sigh&#62;"
566,2,I bought these because they were on the &#34;Amazon lightning deal&#34;  after using for about a week I gave them away to my friend's kids.  The quality of the sound (especially the bass) was not on par with other ear buds that I own.  V-moda makes better quality at a cheaper price.
567,4,"I've got 2012 Toyota Camry. It's got the low end radio in it with a usb and  headphone type aux input. If worked pretty much flawlessly with my iphone 5, but I switched to a Galaxy S4 so had to get this cable.  The cable works pretty good. I didn't notice any electrical/background noise at first. However there is noise, it seems to be when the phone is fully charged at 100%. Even then it's not terrible, kind of a whining noise. Other than that it works good and you can always unplug the USB part of it that's charging for awhile to stop the interference. Of course it doesn't show track info on the radio or allow you to use the radios control to skip tracks,ect. But that's a limitation of using 3.5 aux input cables and not this products fault. I took away one star for the interference noise but other than that it's a great product."
568,4,Did what it was supposed to do.  Used in South Africa to convert USA plugs to functioning connection for charging camera batteries. Like that you can charge more than one appliance in this plug.
569,5,"Arrived on time. Price is right. Construction, flexibility, weight and power handling is just right for its intended light to medium duty use. I use them indoors or outdoors when I need to supply power to a spider receptacle at a respectable distance from the nearest source. The black color is of paramount importance to me as the usual orange cords are too visibly distracting and hard to hide sometimes."
570,5,A quality item. It is priced less than several competitors. It can be labeled without having to apply self stick labes.
571,5,This plug met my expectations for use in Kenya.  My phone and Ipad were easily recharged with this device although I could only do one at a time.
572,5,Love this product! my daughter uses this each night to listen to her lullabies at bedtime. The battery life is great. I plan on using it outside when we go swimming
573,1,I bought this for Christmas for my 10 year od son to use with his mini Ipad. I was amazed by the quality of the packaging and the appearance of the product. However within 2 weeks the left side stopped playing sound and within a month they were not working at all. Would not recommend these to anyone unless you are just looking for a cheap pair that you don't mind replacing often.
574,2,Not loud enough and the mic on the cord isn't good. I had to use the cord off of my Monster headphones to get a better sound.
575,4,AND THE PRICE WAS RIGHT. THIS ITEM SHOULD LAST US A LONG TIME AND PROVIDE US WITH A GOOD CONNECTION FROM OUR PC TO OUR TV.  HAVE A GOOD DAY
576,5,"such a long cord, if you need 50 feet of cord, this is the cord for you! it works, its a cord, it plugs in, and it works, okay that all"
577,5,"After scouring the net I found that they we're the only ones to have what I needed. Great price, and I received it in less than a week.  The entire process flowed perfectly."
578,5,I cant really say to much about this product it does what it says and will save you from not being able to use foreign power supplies when traveling abroad Thank You Very Much
579,3,"Wouldn't have thought there could be too much bass, but these make it hard to distinguish low notes when playing bass guitar; muddy sound playing guitar."
580,5,This is my first ever recited player and I can't be any happier. It took a couple YouTube videos to get itinstalled right but it's not difficult at ask.
581,4,"Just got the clock,pretty good looking and yeah, very loud !! Takes 1 AA battery, easy<br /> to set.Rings for about a minuite"
582,5,"I'm a cyclist.<br /><br />I wanted a single bud headphone so I don't miss road sounds, etc and these definitely fit the bill.<br /><br />GOOD POINTS<br />Single ear bud<br />Good stereo sound<br />Easy pause and skip function<br />Long cord<br />Heavy duty cord<br />Non tangle cord<br /><br />BAD POINTS<br />Don't even want to put anything on here because I love the bud but....<br />If you plan to use this ear bud with your phone, the microphone isn't heard well by the person on the other end of the line.<br /><br />LOVE THIS PRODUCT&#62;Highly Recommend"
583,5,"Really perfect for the AR/XA.  After several applications, and running for several days, I restored an old AR motor with this stuff."
584,3,"They sound okay, nothing special to it. But I mainly got them to not fall out of my ears when running and they do that!"
585,2,"Pros: mic & mute/call/hang up button, ear buds<br />Con: only worked for 2 weeks. Shortages.<br /><br />I've had many of these exact headphones.  But every time they short after a few months,  but this time they only lasted 2 week!"
586,5,Really powerful bass for such a small woofer. My previous system was a 10 year old bose acoustimas and that subwoofer was twice the size but it did not have the range or the power that the outlaw m8 has.
587,5,"This isn't my first time with a great experience with Frends headphones. I've bought these in the past as gifts and they are loved by all girls. Sound quality and material quality cannot be beat. These are by far the only fashion headphones on the market and are definitely a must have for any girl! If you're looking for an amazing unique gift, look no further than either the Frends Layla or Frends Taylor headphones. You will not be disappointed! ;)"
588,5,"I can't recommend these enough. Really great bass sound, which is what I was looking for in terms of the music I listen to (jazz, hip hop etc.)"
589,5,"Item is very robust, configures/setup easily and works flawlessly on Samsung G4 (without additional power). Very pleased indeed. Thank you."
590,5,"Arrived quickly, was as described. Samsung charger used for charging the Galaxy tab.  Works without problems, have been using about 1 month now."
591,5,"I have used these for about a year with a Pentax DSLR that takes AA batteries, and I have been impressed by their capacity given the energy demands of a modern camera. I have not yet noticed any sort of aging resulting in a decrease in the total capacity, although I would not expect such an effect to appear yet. The included charger is sufficient and occasionally noisy---I find it pretty weird that it requires all four batteries to be charged simultaneously."
592,5,These things still hold their charge.  I put them into a battery grip.  I can take around 1000 pictures with a mixture of flash and no flash.  Well worth buying compared to the nikon brand battery
593,5,"Worked exactly as expected and prevents me from leaving things on for more than 6 hours.<br /><br />If you have something like a heater that you want shut off after either 1/2 an hour, 3 hours or 6 hours this little thing is great!"
594,5,Bought this for my daughter when her kitten chewed the wire to her old one. She likes these even better than the lase! They're a tad big on her but realllly cute. Good buy!
595,4,Very good for converting Composite to HDMI. Only issue is a light always on; should have a way to turn off
596,1,"Out of about 12 DVD's that would not play, this unit fixed 5 of them.<br /><br />The parts used to &#34;strip a thin layer&#34; actually left huge circular gouges in the disk. It made it much worse than they were.<br /><br />It took 16 more passes with the buffering disks to get the scratches to a point where they were just slightly visible. The disks were ruined completely, never to be played again. The 'cleaning' parts are a joke as well.<br /><br />Note that most disks (that ended up working) required me to take several passes (at 2 minute intervals each) to get to a playable state. Which is very annoying. Since you have to either sit there and watch it for 2 minutes, or remember to go back and hit the button again to start a new cycle every 2 minutes. At 5 minutes at least you could multitask and go do something else. But 2 minutes isn't long enough to do anything else, so you just have to sit and watch the thing spin.<br /><br />Note also that after a few passes, the buffering disks will smooth out and if it's wet it will grab the disk as it spins and you can hear gears crunch when it does. So you must buy new buffering disks frequently because it doesn't take long for these to 'wear out' and for this to happen (even after sitting 24 hours to dry out). So be prepared to spend money (probably their plan).<br /><br />My recommendation, go buy new DVDs at Amazon.com to replace the ones that won't play, DVD's are cheap now with BluRay being more popular. You will save headache, stress, time and hassle.<br /><br />Now if you're a pro, like a pawn shop, with more than 20 DVD's to repair, then I highly recommend you invest in a quality DVD repair system. Don't buy this."
597,1,"I purchased 4 of these adapters for a mouse that I have used since 1998.  None of the 4 worked, but as inexpensive as they were, it would have cost as much to send them back as it did to buy them so I just threw them away.  And yes, the old track-ball mouse works, I had to buy a cable for it and it works just fine.  These adapters just didn't."
598,5,"I used this in a Hadron Air to fit more than two drives. As the space is extremely tight in there, utilizing a Right Angle connector can be beneficial. Other non-angled molex to sata adapters work fine, but this is great."
599,5,This is one of the very few cables that actually doesn't tangle.  The quality was excellent!<br />ansk ;ldlk;d df'l';l 'ld';
600,5,headphones are amazing their clear sounding they have the best base I have ever heard so far!!! I am very happy that I got these they work and play amazingly well you should buy this.
601,5,It does the job. I was able to mount a 42 inch TV. Half on wood and the other half I used Toggle bolts in drywall. If I need to mount another TV I would re-order this.
602,2,I ordered this about a year ago and had no issues with the cases. They are flexible and hold my Blu-rays. So I needed more and ordered another pack about a month ago from Amazon. When I received it a couple of the cases had broken latches so the cases wouldn't stay shut. Not satisfied.......
603,5,Great headphones! Very durable. Sound is amazing. Very comfortable. Quality costs a pretty penny. These headphones were well worth it.
604,4,"This thing just comes in a plastic bag - the sticker on said bag has a barcode and reads simply, &#34;Component A/V Cable for Playstation 2 - NEW&#34;. There's no company logo on the actual plug either; just the arrow on the top that shows you which side should be facing the top when you plug it into the PS2. While Amazon mentions the distributor, I have no idea who actually manufactures this thing. It says nothing of substance, which is unfortunate because this IS NOT plug-and-play, so to speak.<br /><br />Here are the super-simple instructions it SHOULD have. You must first boot up your PS2 with the normal A/V cables without a disc in (or with the disc tray open), and go to 'System Configuration', than change your 'Component Video Out' settings from RGB to Y Cb/Pb Cr/Pr. Now turn it off, plug in the Component Cable, turn it back on and go to the &#34;Component&#34; Video Mode on your HDTV - the PS2 picture will be coming in clear as a bell (that's a saying, right?) Why couldn't this have said that - just the slightest piece of paper with this crucial information!? Whoever made this is a lazy, suspicious manufacturer...<br /><br />BUT IT WORKS! IT WORKS SO WELL! So I don't know why they're acting like they have some shoddy product worth hiding! PS2 games no longer look &#34;blurry&#34; or &#34;fuzzy&#34; on my HDTV, no ghosting or any other image issue that they previously had. They look as sharp as, or sharper than, anything else from that generation - the Dreamcast/Gamecube/Wii/Xbox1. If you've downloaded PS2 games from the &#34;Playstation Classics&#34; portion of the PSN on your PS3, than it's a very similar quality of visuals. It's a MARKED improvement over how things look traditionally. So I highly recommend the cable - this thing gets the job done, for sure, and it's super cheap.<br /><br />The PS2 library is LEGENDARY - this is serious contender for best console of all time, along with the PSX and SNES, so if you want to enjoy your games on modern TV's, youhave to pick this up. Not to mention, picking up older games from the massive library is a great solution if you're looking to game on the cheap, or miss genres that are badly supported on newer consoles, like jrpgs. This is a game-changer; it pulls the PS2 kicking-and-screaming back into the living room along with any other console plugged into your HDTV, all the way up the PS4.<br /><br />But it needs instructions - you gotta know what you're doing first. And you also better make sure you pay attention to the plug; it doesn't seem to quite want to fit in the PS2 at first and needs some gentle shoving (make sure the side with the arrow is pointed up, like the RGB cable already in your PS2!). It seems suspicious, but it's not, and it works really well. Can't 5-star it though, since it's so weirdly presented like a shoddy product."
605,3,"Overall these headphones are not bad. They have decent sound and good bass response. They fit in the ear well and hold an ok charge.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that the range is completely terrible. Using these earbuds and having my iphone in my pocket, the bluetooth cuts out something terrible. Especially if trying to wear them while doing yard work. They even cutout if the iphone is in my pocket sitting at work. I have to keep the iPhone on the table, else the bluetooth cuts out.<br /><br />Other than that, these are pretty decent earbuds."
606,1,The vertical supports were not drilled correctly.  In desperation I drilled the cross brackets so I could get it together.  At that point the frame twisted.  After I mounted the bracket to my 3/4 plywood  support with 1/4 inch lag screws I was able to flatten the bracket.  I assembled the frame more than 4 times (3hours).  None of the ways worked. The instructions were no help.  I was not able to determine which parts were bad.  I suggest the manufacturer try to assemble this square bracket from there kit something is wrong.  The metal in the frame is thin and is probably cold roll steel it drills easily (have not looked at the drill bits probably now trash). I agree with the other reviewers it really should be a problem attaching 4 screws but it is.  The bracket works even if it is flimsy.  I would not buy this product again.
607,5,BOUGHT THIS UNIT AND HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY SATISFIED WITH IT.  I'VE HAD HOME AUDIO RECEIVERS BEFORE BUT THE PRICE AND SERVICE WAS AMAZING.  UNHEARD OF PRICE.  WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND.  SELLER GAVE EXPERT DELIVERY.
608,1,"I live in the country and zero radio stations come in.  And after playing any CD more than 3 times, the CD's begin to skip"
609,5,these are very nice as far as what I paid for them the only thing I dont like is they are low and not much bass
610,4,A little dark but they fit well over glasses and seem to work fine. I may even buy more soon.
611,4,"Simple, clean, compact. Fits pre-iPhone 5 30-pin hacks. Decent sound for the size and price. I would buy again. Great!"
612,5,Go to the nearest home supply and buy 100' of wire - its more expensive and most of it is solid - this wire is well insulated and well made and costs much less than anything available locally - would recomend.
613,5,These are the best inexpensive headphones I have ever purchase anywhere. Only thing is that they come with no comfort foam pieces so the headphones can make your ears sore with prolonged use.
614,5,I love these headphone. They are cute and perfect for listening to music or watching a movie. The colors even match my bed spread in my room.
615,2,"The lamp i ordered for my Samsung TV simply did not fit. The screw that holds the back (silver part) was in the way of installing the lamp. (My original lamp did not have that screw there). I had to take the screw out, use a saw to cut off the plastic piece, and then TAPE the back on, in order for the lamp to slide into place. Only good part, is that the lamp stlll works, but it was a hassle."
616,5,"LSD--low self discharge--is the new standard for rechargeable batteries that spend time just waiting to be used, like in flashlights or camera flash units, or portable Bluetooth speakers.  The catch is not all LSD batteries are equal.  Capacities are wildly exaggerated in off brand batteries.  I've not compared storage lives, but in use, these eneloops outlast another &#34;brand&#34; which claims a capacity that is easily a third higher than these.  I've bought the AAA size, too, for TV remotes, and they work very well compared to conventional NiMH batteries.  Highly recommended."
617,5,"I use to send satellite channels to rarely used bedrooms, avoiding monthly charges for boxes. Works great. Easy to set up."
618,4,"I'm impressed by the sound - it is pretty good for such a small speakers.<br />Things that cause frustration:<br />* delay during source switching<br />* falls asleep pretty quick, but very slow to wake up<br />* remote is rather directional<br /><br />Overall - hey, what do you expect for $170? You get good sound. The rest is optional.<br />If you can boil your hookup down to a single input, then you are in good shape!"
619,5,Just what I needed to extend my security cameras power cord. It doesn't change your receiving quality of picture and was inexpensive.
620,5,"Reception is very good, sound is excellent, light weight, the flash light produces a strong beam and the solar charger works well. The siren is feature I had not initially tested.  However my grandson found this feature at about 5:30 am on a Saturday morning.  I will attest that it works, no one in the house was sleeping after his test run. It is a great piece of equipment."
621,5,"Finally received this today and hooked it up immediately. I used it to connect my Xbox360 and XboxOne to one HDMI on my receiver. I'm fully aware of the HDMI input on the XboxOne, but I want to use each Xbox separately. Input was correctly sensed when either Xbox was turned on. The Select switch worked too. The best bang-for-the-buck device I've ever bought."
622,1,"I understand it is refurbished, which means there is the possibility of this, but after a few days it would no longer turn on. I should have just bought a new item."
623,5,I am impressed with this little speaker. The sound quality is very decent and can be turned up quite loudly. All of the required cords come with the speaker. It's definitely worth the money. And I love that it can be compacted.
624,5,"I'm a very thrifty buyer. I don't like overspending and I try my best not to buy certain items unless I feel they are really worth it. That being said, it took me some time to coming to terms with buying a bluetooth speaker for more than $200 so I did a lot of homework. Some background here is that I treasure music. I'm one of those people who is probably listening to music for the most part of any alone time I have during my day or night time, I'm the one singing in my car when going any and everywhere and I'm likely that neighbor with the music up, just a little too loud. I listen to music while I game, while I'm in the kitchen, while I'm doing any housework and I queue up my music when I'm about to sleep (to my wife's chagrin). My point is that a $300 bluetooth speaker purchase is well worthwhile for me, even being value driven and thrifty.<br /><br />Simply put, this is just the best sounding bluetooth speaker at this price point that I have found. I have listened to the Big Jambox, Beats Pill, etc. and nothing comes close except for Bose itself with the mini, but the SL3 is much, much louder and keeps the clarity at high and very low volume.<br /><br />I have read through a few of the lower reviews and most of them seem to have nothing to do with the quality of sound. Likewise, those who are complaining about \\""muddy bass\\"" and \\""holes\\"" in sound have no recommendations for bluetooth speakers that they consider to be better.<br /><br />I have gone to Best Buy, Micro Center and various other electronic stores and have yet to find another system of this caliber.<br /><br />So what makes it so great? The clarity of sound for me is absolutely top notch. You hear pretty much every note of sound in your music. Secondly, you can turn it up pretty loud and nothing is distorted. My previous $100 bluetooth solution would get rattly when really high and sound would be distorted when maxed out. The SL3 goes pretty much full bore with no hesitation or issues. The sound is also more full. No matter how high or low you go, it sounds like you're playing the song at the right level. With beats that are heavy on the bass, you get everything vs. rattled noise when really high and still hear the boom when it's really low.<br />These things are what make this SL3 outshine the Pill XL and the Big Jambox - all of these are great, don't get me wrong. I doubt you can really go wrong, however, it'll be to each listener to figure out what they use their system to do. I found that the Big Jambox doesn't provide the bass that I like in my sound. There's bass, but it sounds very \\""held in\\"", like they're set to make sure the drivers don't blow up. When the sound is very low, the bass disappears and the big Jambox sounds like my $100 Logitech bluetooth speaker. The Pill XL is very nice and the bass there is great at high and low volumes however for some reason the mid just doesn't seem there. They sound pretty clear but seem almost designed for hip-hop and rap (and I'm not saying this because they are associated with Dr. Dre), I mean the sound of actual singing seems muted on them, as if they amplify the instruments vs. the sound of singing. To make an example, consider a 5.1 or 7.1 surround system with the center channel tuned down, this is how they sound to me. You can hear the songs and they sound great but the singing parts are a little subdued. This isn't an issue for hip hop or rap music which is build around big bass. Just as an aside, most of my music is encoded at 320kbps but I do have a few lossless as well. All my tests are done using lossless, but for general listening it varies.<br /><br />Is it really worth 5 stars? Absolutely, at least for me. There are some downers though and it's a little bit odd that Bose would omit these things from a current system. In the spirit of being thorough for those considering speakers and like me, want all the info they can get before plopping down $300, here are the things I'd have liked to have but don't. NFC,which would allow the speaker to pair with a tap or simply connect when in range (quicker pairing), a remote which would allow control from a distance. There's no aptX either but Bose sound solutions are proprietary anyway and I would not expect them to license technology like this from anyone else.<br /><br />Granted, these weren't a big deal for me or I wouldn't have purchased it, however, if you are considering an all-round one speaker solution then keep in mind that you can't do handsfree with, so no speakerphone and without a remote, you won't be able to alter the volume of the unit itself unless you're able to touch it. For some, having these features might be more worth it than slightly fuller/better sound. There's not a whole helluva lot of difference between these 3 systems other than slightly differentiated listening experiences. But I love my SL3 and wouldn't give it up for anything else at this point in time.which would allow the speaker to pair with a tap or simply connect when in range (quicker pairing), a remote which would allow control from a distance.

625,2,"Sound escapes a lot more with this pads than with the originals.  People at the office complain about the noise my headset generates now, and with the original pads, I could listen at high volumes and nobody else could hear."
626,5,"This company has the absolute BEST customer service!!! The first product I received failed, so i contacted their customer service. They immediately replied and apologized, and immediately sent me a replacement. They did not ask me to send in the defective one, they just sent a new replacement which has worked flawlessly! I would Highly recommend this company, and will buy all my future cables from BlueRigger. I have recommended them to my family and friends, they have all been immensely satisfied with BlueRigger products!"
627,4,"I have a tilting, swivel unit and wanted to be sure the sound (and sound bar) moved with the television.  This mount ensures that happens.  I docked one star because the set up wasn't as smooth as I felt it should be.  My sound bar's size could be at fault (52&#34; and BIG) but it shouldn't say it's universal if it loses functionality on larger sound bars."
628,5,"of course you can pay more and get better headphones.but for under $10 I don't think you'll do better than these. They're comfortable in my small ears, come with 3 sizes of covers, and sound great."
629,5,"Little speaker, big sound. I'm a snob and I like this. It's not like having a real stereo system in my bedroom -- but SOOO much better than cranking the stereo and trying to hear it in my bedroom. Will be adding to the system in the near future. Build it as you need it. So great."
630,3,This mount cradles the Roku perfectly. But if you try to mount it on the back of your tv (as the manual states) you will most likely have issues. My tv has v shaped holes and the clips that are given are completely worthless (cheap flimsy plastic) your best bet is to mound this directly to the wall with the provided screws or zip tie it to the mounting bracket. bracket itself is perfect but the mounting options leave something to be desired.
631,5,It works exactly as promised.  Precision optical connection resulting in a great picture.  The remote control works great and switching is instantaneous.
632,1,The release mechanism broke the very first day which made it very difficult to remove the TV from the wall.
633,1,"When the 25-cent jack for the AC adapter in the back of the boom box breaks -- and it will -- because it's a 25-cent part -- the boom box will NOT WORK with the AC plugged-in.  You'll have to run it off EIGHT D-size BATTERIES -- and, while doing so, it will NOT RECHARGE the MP3 device, iPod, iPhone, whatever.  Bad design: The power outlet plug itself is not at fault but rather the small piece of circuit board it is soldered to. It is NOT soldered to the main board but the instead to a small piece of board that has a red, white and black wire coming off of it. The solder joint that connects the red wire connection with the \\""center pin\\"" of the outlet plug eventually cracks."
634,5,"This thing is awesome! I have a Kenwood DNX710 in dash unit, I was looking to possibly add the bluetooth unit to it- but it was $200.00 - I friend told me, to get this- that it would not only let me make & receive calls but listen to my iphone music/pandora, etc. I plugged it in, hooked it up, it synced right away to my phone, I tried the music, worked like a charm. Then I had someone call me, sure enough, the music faded out and my call came through...like I said, like a charm. I LOVE this thing. A+++++++"
635,4,"These are very well made, but I think they are just a little overpriced.  It keeps the batteries from shorting out in my drawer."
636,5,"Bought these tapes last year and just started using them.  Amazon had the BEST price on the entire internet!  And, this brand has the highest quality.  Would definitely recommend to anyone and would buy these again."
637,2,"These earbuds are not horrible, just one annoying characteristic that has caused me to stop using them.<br /><br />To start off, pros are these buds sit really flush with the ears not causing any obscene objects sticking far out of your ear. The con is the remote/mic is excessively big and sits down around your chest. I usually like to feed by earbuds under my shirt so the cord is not flapping out while moving around. With the mic being down by the chest this makes it a little impractical. I have since stopped using these earbuds because of being consistently annoyed by the location of the remote/mic."
638,5,This Vizio remote is great. I was uneasy ordering a remote online but after it arrived it was clear i made the right decision. the remote operated the television righy out of the box.<br />I would highly recommend this product.
639,4,"I wanted to be able to hook my computer up to the TV, which this does for me.  I had the small problem of no sound and went back to the reviews and have to thank the person who reviewed with instructions on getting the sound through the TV (system preferences; sound; output).  I would have liked a longer cable as a 10 ft cable isn't very long, but I went with what I could find."
640,5,"Best bluetooth for the price amazing bass, this little speaker is much bigger in sound than one twice it's size and price. Battery is better than most of the ones I've purchased."
641,5,Finally a tv remote my 82 year old father in an assisted living can't mess up.  He can actually work this one.  I bought four remotes before this one.  This is the only one that is simple enough and does not have too many buttons to confuse him.  Highly recommended.  Hope it last as some reviews complained about it not working after a few months.  So far it's great!
642,5,This is a small radio with big sound. It sounds nice and clear and gets a lot of stations even on FM.  I like it 100 % more than my last shower radio and that one was 4 x's larger.  (This one takes 3 AA batteries.)
643,4,"Was having trouble finding these components.  They worked.  They only have one set of dip switches, not the gain set, but they work fine."
644,5,"Love the design -- simple, durable, and great if you travel. There's a bit of genius in the design -- really superior to anything else on the market. The sound is top quality, much better than Beats IMHO. You can always adjust the bass as needed on your sound equipment if that's what you want for certain types of music. But if you listen to jazz, classical and other genres beyond hip-hop, these provide a more nuanced sound experience."
645,4,Working good. Shipped next day and received day after that. I am very happy with the purchase. Now I am able to watch youtube  on TV from my play book.
646,1,"Sony MDR-ZX300AP/L Over the Head Headset for Andoid, Blue<br /><br />This is my third time trying to order the Sony MDR-ZX300AP/L Over the Head Headset for Andoid, Blue with the inline microphone as shown and described on this page.  The one I get the is Sony MDR-ZX300 Blue headphones without the microphone.  refund and going to bestbuy.com to buy it instead."
647,3,"This cover isn't nearly as nice as it seems in the photo.  It does a decent job of protecting the device, but isn't at all my idea of a quality product, up to BOSE's usual standards.  Since there aren't really any other options, there isn't much choice other than the color band around the edge - green, blue or orange.  Odd colors for sure."
648,5,"I am so pleased with the purchase of these BOSE QuietComfort 20i noise cancelling headphones.  The noise cancelling is absolutely remarkable.  I took a conference call on them today while transitioning from the house to the car. When it was over and I hung up and turned off the phone, I realized how much quieter they make everything.  Truly an exquisite purchase."
649,5,"Just got this and I have to say that I'm impressed.  Great sound.  I was concerned that it was going to be too big (because it looked huge), but it's really just the right size for me. Loved how it set the time on it's own.  I was also worried that I would have to take off my iphone cover to charge it (I use a clear case, fyi).  It fits on the charger perfectly with the cover on.  Even the remote came with a pre-installed battery.  If this holds up over time like this, you can count me as one satisfied customer."
650,4,"Almost didn't choose this option because shipping wasn't free, making the cost between a third to half that of replacing the headphones completely.<br />They do fit perfectly and have rejuvenated the comfort experience of my 238s."
651,5,"Product is great, everything works as advertised and the light is very bright. The cell phone charger device actually works !!! Which is great for an emergency. I RECOMMEND this product to anyone who wants a reliable flashlight."
652,5,"all in all, its a good product, highly recommended if you love mother earth and wish to reduce waste from battery going into landfills"
653,2,"I've been through lot's of low level earbuds. Not saying that they are bad but generalizing them by price. When I initially tried the INK'D they sounded great. Better than many others in it's price range. However they do have unreliable hardware. I've been through too many, some one ear failed, others they just began to sound awful. All these problems begin within 2 months of use. Same things happen to my friends as well. They do have good customer service however, so if they do break you can exchange them. But note that I've exchanged them almost 5 times just this past year. My advice is to stay away from these earphones."
654,5,"Easy to install , holds plenty of weight without sagging and really extends from the wall a long way ."
655,5,"Very good and as describe would recommend thi to any one, great price and arrived as they advertise, easy to use"
656,3,When I use it I am feel inconvenience. Because I can hear a strange noise coming from the in-ear headphones.
657,5,"02/25/2014...I finally got this resolved.  After contacting the company, I was told that plugging this into the original Bose Sound Dock DOES NOT charge the unit due to a different in the voltage.  You have to use a separate charger for this.  I charged the unit and its worked fine ever since.  Definitely something that should be mentioned in the product manual.  Other than that I still love this item!<br />February 9, 2014 updated review...I originally reviewed this in January.  Today the item stopped working completed and gives an audible alert like its about to die and then wouldn't work anymore.  Sounds a lot like one of the other reviews.  Seems to me that it died although they say when its plugged into the sound dock, its supposed to charge the Auris' internal rechargeable battery.  Not the case.  You would also think it would stay powered when its connected to the sound dock even if the rechargeable battery didn't work.  Apparently this isn't the case either cause its completely dead.  I bought it on January 5th and I am one day over the return policy with Amazon!  I have asked for an exception but not sure if they will honor.  Apparently I am not the first person with problems.  Be careful...Sound was great...FOR A MONTH!<br /><br />PREVIOUS INITIAL REVIEW...I have been looking for an adapter for the original Bose Sounddock and this is it!  I have an iphone 5 and it doesn't hook into the Bose Sounddock and needed some sort of adapter for bluetooth.  This is even better than locking the phone into the dock!  You still have use of your phone while playing music from IHeart Radio and Pandora or just the music on your phone.  This plugs into the sounddock and you just have to pair it and your are good to go.  So easy that I wish I had bought this sooner.  The sound is really good too!  If a call comes through, it plays the ring through the Bose and when you answer it switches to the phone.  You can't go wrong buying this.  You can walk about 30 ft away from it and it still plays!  Love this!!!nd it still plays!  Love this!!!"
658,1,"This product was not adequately described.  I made the mistake of relying on the reputation of Skullcandy and the 4+ stars on the Amazon site in choosing this product to use with my Samsung Galaxy SIII phone.  I love Skullcandy products for their great sound quality and the microphone made it seem like a perfect fit for use with the SIII.  Imagine my surprise when I am trying to place a call and the mic didn't work.  That's when I noticed the &#34;Made for iP...&#34; on the front of the box.  How did I miss this critical piece of information on the Amazon page? I didn't; it's not there.  Amazon's great customer service immediately sent me a return label but guess what, I am the one who has to deal with the return and now a new order.  Why doesn't someone use their grey matter to list something as important as &#34;this product's mic will not work with most Android phones&#34;?  I would love to know why in the world Skullcandy would even make one of their a high end products available to less than half of the smartphone market."
659,3,"I thought i would use for home theater mains, but they are very harsh and very little midbass.<br /><br />They look good, seem to be good quality components, packed well, shipped well, but i found them very harsh to listen to."
660,1,"Got the product, tried using it but it will not display the picture. Tried using both TVs. Finally went to apple store and bought a belkin converter. Works just great!!<br /><br />Save yourself undue aggravation and just buy something that works!!"
661,5,This is definitely the most expensive shower radio I have ever bought but I feel it's worth it.  Love Love Love it!!!!!
662,5,"I bought this because of the brand, I was not disappointed. Works great smooth deep, rich sound. it is very comfy also, A great product."
663,5,"I've owned this radio for about 6 years.  The sound quality and battery life is good.  I originally purchaced it to listen to radio broadcasts at sporting events for which it works well, and having the weather band is nice.  The volume is good and the headphones that are included are decent..  The reception is good, and seems no better or worse than other similar radios i've owned.  Many of these types of radios use the headphone cord as the antenna so when it moves around it can sometimes affect the reception.  The overall quality is good and controls are easy to navigate.  I don't use it every day, but it has held up well and has been a good radio."
664,5,Go his for my 7 year olds room- the projection is really cool- would definitely recommend for a kids room. Pretty easy to set also
665,3,"Maybe my ears are shaped wrong, but these have a tough time staying in my ears or being comfortable. I actually have to just jam the earpiece in and even out the cord meant to shape around my ear. Also, each seems to be sized differently. It's the anatomical features of these headphones that agitate me. It impairs the hearing quality.<br /><br />The quality's okay. Not superb. I find that the songs I have with cymbals in them are unequalized and hurt my ears, when with older headphones (that have changed, so I can not longer buy them) I could turn the songs up.<br /><br />So...these are okay. They are not fantastic. They aren't worth the list price. I got them as a Black Friday deal and still think they were too much. If you're desperate, go for it. If you can afford some better headphones, I'd opt for those. I don't really have any other choice right now for headphones, so I'm stuck with these until I get to Books-a-Million to grab some Skullcandy or iHip ones."
666,4,"Looks nice and is very light weight, plays very will also. I only gave it 4stars cause it was bigger than i expected. Not a big problem, but i was kind of wanting something just a little bit smaller. Great radio through"
667,5,Headphone adapters rule! Great price and great quality. These work great.Order a bunch cause you know how easy these are to lose. facebook.com/perversepunx
668,5,"These Speakers look great and sound great too. They are small enough to fit on a desk in a dorm room, yet pack enough punch to make your neighbors upset (if you wanted to). After having these speakers for almost one year, I have zero complaints about this system. The aesthetics are amazing and the sound is exactly what I was looking for.  Unless you are an audiophile and you want some type of small hi-fi system, there is not need to look any further than these speakers."
669,4,Very good for the price but I'm very disappointed that he connectors weren't gold coated as pictured. They should have been?
670,2,"the usb cable does not work properly, it can only charge my device. the cable is not recognized by a every computer that i have used."
671,3,The new bulb was just a bit brighter then the one I was replacing that was four years old.  I expected it to be much brighter for a new bulb. I will look into the warranty!
672,4,"Awesome Bluetooth speaker! I tried the Oontz, JBL before I decided on the Bose.<br /><br />There was something about these that seem produce music vs precise sound. I love the bass it produces for such a small speaker. Speaker placement is important , ideally place it on a wooden surface like your office desk etc. My wife and I did a lot of blind tests with multiple speakers and we navigated towards the Bose most of the time.<br /><br />Pros: Amazing sound , lots of bass for such a small speaker, battery life<br />Cons: If you listen to a lot of acoustic music and don't want a lot of bass you might have to use an EQ, pairing is not automatic - I seem to have to click on the pairing button on the speaker to get connected each time. Sleeves and other accessories are outrageously priced...<br /><br />I am nitpicking on the Cons and definitely recommend for an in-house Bluetooth speaker (not ideal for traveling)"
673,5,"This was my second purchase of these headphones.  I had some that I had used almost daily while exercising and doing yard work for several years. After one of the earpieces quit working, I tried several other types of headphones in the same price range but none compared with both fit and sound quality.  I was glad to find another set of my old favorites still available."
674,4,We like it! There is no more problem with people or object blocking transmitted commands. Everything just works as programmed.<br /><br />Experience to date:<br />- We use the physical remote almost exclusively. The app on the mobile device is just inconvenient and a waste of time for day to day use. It did help with setup however.<br /><br />- We needed to buy an extra IR transmitter from Logitech beyond what they included to reach all of our devices in our cabinets. It worked well after that.<br /><br />- I do hope they get a solution for the PS 4 soon. We do have to run that independently of the remote. We bought their addon to work with the PS3. It will not help with the PS 4. It is simply incompatible.
675,1,I bought these discs and waited too long to try them.<br />Not one single disc worked.<br />My drive wouldn't even recognize them.<br />I've used other dual layer discs with no problems.<br />What a waste of landfill space.<br />They don't even make good coasters.
676,5,I ordered the Tascam DP01FXCD which needed it's original power source to work. I found a new unused power supply and the system is running excellent.
677,2,Received item smelling heavily of cigarette smoke. Item was in good physical condition beside the fact that it smelled horrible.
678,1,"I am writing this rating on the VideoSecu Articulating Arm TV Wall Mount, Full Motion Tilt Swivel. This product is of poor design. I do not recommend this product. I sent it back."
679,4,"I use them to run/listen music. Great sound, although the bass should be better...<br />I'm a very demanding person.<br />You wont be desapointed. Trust me.<br />PS: I also like the V-Moda models and think they are similar with S4. V-Moda has more bass (if you like a heavy bass, of course)."
680,5,"The glasses are just fine, I am very pleased with this item. With the right 3D video player and 3D codec the experience is fantastic! I would also give  top ranking to the seller for their very professional approach."
681,5,"I purchased two of these in this color, and have come back to purchase two more for myself and two of the grey/light blue ones for my daughter.<br /><br />A bit about this speaker:<br /><br />1) AWESOME SOUND QUALITY. It can get loud at full-volume--like louder than any other portable speaker I've ever used (and I'm a techie, so I've had at least a dozen different types, ranging from full-size portable party/karaoke speakers to bluetooth, to this compact type). The beauty of this speaker is that, even at high volumes, the sound doesn't get distorted or tinny. When daisy chained with one other speaker, it is loud enough to rival my inset home-theater setup at mid-volume.<br /><br />2) THE CHARGE LASTS A LONG TIME. Firstly, love the rechargeable battery. One huge pet peeve of mine with other portables is that you always need to change out the batteries (usually at the most inconvenient times), and you never know when they'll actually run down so, if you are on the go, you better bring along a pack of extra batteries. PITA.<br /><br />This thing takes next to no time to charge up via my laptop, and the charge lasts for hours and hours--maybe even days? Who knows? I've been playing music nonstop today on two of them daisy-chained together, and they are still working like they are newly charged. So, at higher volumes, you can count on at least 6-8 hours constant play minimum. I also often forget to turn off my speakers after my music has stopped, but they seem to keep the charge extremely well despite it.<br /><br />3) FEATURES VOLUME CONTROLS, POWER BUTTON, AND DAISY-CHAIN INPUT JACK. Love that I can adjust the volume on these things, rather than only have the option to adjust it on the source. And not only can you daisy-chain as many of these as you want (which I highly recommend--you cannot believe the quality of sound that comes out of these in multiples), but the more units actually enhance the quality of the sound, rather than compete with each other and end up causing distortion.<br /><br />4) PERFECTLY PORTABLE. Closed, this thing is about the size of a biscuit--a smallish one, at that. I have dainty hands, and it fits in my flattened palm with about 1/2\\"" of skin left over around the perimeter of the unit. The retractable bass enhancement feature is really easy to use (don't over-twist it--only takes a bit to unlock and relock)and really enhances the sound quality. The input jack is connected to the bottom of the device, but it's got brilliant little built-in grooves to hold it flat and tight against the unit bottom when not in use. It also comes with its own little carrying bag to keep it dust-free and ready to roll. It's SUPER lightweight, and the pinched centers around the base make it easy to hold and carry (say, in case you want to wake your lazy teenager up when they're sleeping past two on a Saturday afternoon).<br /><br />5) EXCELLENT DESIGN. This speaker was designed to maximize function without skimping on form. The low-profile of the unit means you don't have to worry about knocking it about--it can easily stay situated, even on slopes--especially since there are tiny rubber nodules at each corner of its bottom to give it extra grab. It might sound like having it be so tip-proof might not be such a big deal, but when you consider that you have functional power and volume buttons, you want to be able to press down on those without having the unit rock or tip over (on this model, the area that is red actually presses inward on three sides--one is power, one is +volume, the other is -volume).<br /><br />6) GREAT QUALITY AT A GREAT PRICE. Compare this unit to similar models and the others just don't cut it. I'm kicking myself for getting my daughter two of the [[ASIN:B004OA733E iHome iHM60GY 3.5mm Aux Portable Speaker (Gray Translucent)]]iHome iHM60GY speakers. Not only do they not have a power or volume buttons, but they are bulkier, tip more easily, don't hold a charge as long, don't sound nearly as good, can't bedaisy-chained, take longer to charge, and don't even come with a carrying case. For the $4 bucks, do yourself a favor and but this one instead.daisy-chained, take longer to charge, and don't even come with a carrying case. For the $4 bucks, do yourself a favor and but this one instead."
682,3,"I wanted a portable BT speaker so I grabbed this one. Its not bad, but its also nothing special at all in terms of sound quality. Yes, it's loud....but there is big difference between loud sounds and loud music. The bass distorts rather quick and is not 'clean' at all - regardless of EQ settings. You CAN manage to make it decent when you use your (eg) iPhone EQ.<br />Literally good bang for buck."
683,5,"Pro:  Good battery life, decent range on them.<br /><br />Con: Noice reduction was good, but not as much I had hoped for.  Still a great pair of headphones."
684,5,This replaces a wireless headset using infrared technology.  This is so much better; it has great fidelity and range all over the house.  It is nice to not require line-of-sight and not be interupted by sunlight<br /><br />The headset is very comfortable to wear over long periods of time.
685,5,"I was pleasantly surprised how easy it was to load.  It took me an hour to install and upload over 650 of my personal mp3's on it.  The player came with Rhapsody software (on a mini CD disc) and categorized my music for me by genre, artist, and song.  You can make a &#34;GoTo&#34; playlist and delete songs from the player itself.<br /><br />I like that you can play mp3's or listen to FM radio.<br /><br />Headphone are cheap and recommend buying better ones."
686,5,I love this e reader! Should this break I will purchase another e reader from Barnes and Noble.  I have owned several of the nook e readers. I own the nook simple touch and nook color as well as the kindle keyboard.  I also  previously owned the original nook but  passed on to my sister when I received this one two years ago.  I have had none of the issues with the screen as other users but don't use the glowlight all that much except when traveling out of town.  All in all I like Barnes and Nobles e readers better than kindle and use my Nook the most. I find Barnes and Noble makes more solid and study e readers and tablets.  I mostly download free auio books from my local library and this works out well for me. A super e reader that does what it's supposed to and does it very well.
687,2,"The radio was described as having an equalizer (rock, pop, etc.), but nowhere in the users manual was this described, and I found no resources on the Internet to help either. The radio has too much distortion and I can't change it. Bah."
688,5,"Works great. Indicator lights are helpful. Doesn't charge very fast but that might be  a good thing, I guess, because usually charging fast means reducing the life of the batteries."
689,4,Overall good quality product.  Sturdy and included all mounting hardware.  The locking design is functional too.  The leveler is not that acculturate as it was lined up and the tv is slightly slanted.  It's holding up my 42&#34; plasma securely.
690,1,"Stay away from this product it has no power. I tried this in every area inside the living room, on the roof, outside along the house front & backyard too. The most channels it ever got were 2 we're 15 miles from several tv stations it is the worst antenna i've ever bought. I bought a less expensive rca outdoor antenna & without trying got every local station & 3 stations in Wyoming over 60 miles away.You've been warned."
691,3,They should have at least given you 2 clothes.  I am sure the liquid stuff costs about a dollar.  LOL.
692,5,Great item! So glad I found this audio cable!<br />I needed it for my 3D tv to connect my older stereo system -- works perfectly!<br />Thanks BlueRigger! -- you solved my dilemma!
693,5,"I've used this for working out and running and it has never let me down. It's not the fanciest mp3 player, but I don't use Apple products, and I don't really care how pretty something like this is. The clip is still going strong, and doesn't slip or slide around. Four gigs held enough variety for me to enjoy, without having to switch the songs out very often. It's simple, but not very pricey and does it's job. That's all I needed."
694,5,"Great price and work well, thin , but sturdy! Low profile"
695,5,"I listen to a wide variety of genres from classical to metal and these handle everything very well; my audiophile is pleased!  I'm running these from my PC (HT Omega Claro Halo XT) to my Onkyo TX-SR606 receiver and they sound awesome.  I've got a Bose system upstairs and I think these speakers are far cleaner sounding.  I've had Bose and Harman/Kardon speakers on my computer for years and this blows them away hands down, the bass isn't overpowering (adjustable on the sub though I've left it at the factory default for now) and the mid and upper ranges are smooth even at high volumes.  I expect to happily be using these for a long while."
696,5,Very inexpensive way to have large sound on your ipad or iphone.  It has a large enough sound for me to listen to YouTube<br />and not shake the house.
697,5,"It took me a day to figure out that these were adjustable...once I was able to adjust them, I fell in love with these."
698,5,This little speaker has great sound for its size.  We used it by the pool during our vacation and it created good quality sound and volume poolside.  My brother could not believe the sound and it was the must have poolside for the next week.  It has held up great for the past year.  Just recharge every once in a while.
699,4,It's a simple cover and does its job. Seems a little pricy for all it is. Could be a little more padded.
700,5,".The sound is a lot more crisp and clear. I can here every step, every breath taken, and it takes my home theatre to another level."
701,1,"Subwoofer was defective.  Subwoofer started making a high pitched noise as soon as it was powered on.  JBL customer service is of absolutely no help.  Thankfully Amazon know how to treat their customers, they are fully refunding me.<br /><br />  I would advice anyone who is thinking about buying this product to hesitate.  The problem I had with my subwoofer is a known defect and JBL still sells them.  I am thankful that my subwoofer was defective right off the bat so I was able to use Amazon's return policy.<br /><br />JBL and Harman audio will never see another penny from me after this annoying ordeal."
702,1,Fell apart would not buy again.  This product is crap!!!!  DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM !!!  The padding came off and the plastic piece came out.
703,5,"It's a re-branded Fiio E7. Aside from it saying Pyle on the front it's the exact same unit for $10-$15 cheaper. Excellent quality, very good performance. A+."
704,5,"Great remote.  I'm a total technotard and I still figured out how to program this remote.  Yeah me!  I was able to program my TV, DVD player, stereo, and whatever that box is that's attached to me TV that makes it digital compatible.  Works great."
705,5,Purchased for a mobility scooter. They were an exact fit and after several months still hold a charge and can go miles between charges.
706,2,"...but immediately died thereafter.  The bargain price isn't really worth having to replace this cable several times a year.  If you need an HDMI cable for long-term use, it's probably best to go with something else."
707,5,"Exactly what I wanted! I use it for music while I work out. I like that I can create and choose playlists, and that the player clips onto my clothing. I was concerned about the plastic clip - but haven't had any problems with it in the 4+ months I've had it. (Even if I did have problems with the clip, the play is so light, that I really wouldn't need it.) I am very happy that I did not go with a much more expensive device."
708,5,I had been running low on blank disks and locally the 100 packs have been moving back up in price. I was happy to find these Philips brand black packs on Amazon. I ordered 2 of them so I'll be good for a while.<br />So far they have worked perfectly with no disk errors. I will check the Philips brand next time I need more disks.
709,5,This will work to connect HDMI output from computer to VGA input on monitor.  Check your monitor first though.  See if it has the DVI input then get a DVI/HDMI cable. It will be a digital display and will will be cheaper.
710,1,"Not as pictured, but adapter still worked. I decided to spend a couple of extra bucks on what I thought was the trusted \\""Tripp Lite\\"" named version, but instead got an unmarked unit with a Chinese fortune type paper tag in bag that simply said \\""Made in China\\"". It did work, but it is disappointing to shell out a couple extra bucks to get a name branded item, just to get duped.<br />1 star for misleading me... update your photo!"
711,1,"I used to run with a similar looking Sennheiser headphones that I loved.  So when I needed a new pair, I thought these would basically be a newer, nicer version.  Wrong.<br />The addition of the volume wheel makes these terrible to run with.  The length of the cord is just perfectly the wrong length to be comfortable.  Either it hangs down your back, knocking against you with every step, or you clip it to the neck of your shirt and the cord flops against your face.  Also, the wheel has a tendency to change them volume when it rubs against you.  Maybe it would be tolerable if you only use it with an armband, but absolutely avoid this like the plague if you clip your mp3 player to your waistband.  But at least the headphones are comfortable to wear with a hat and sunglasses, which is better than I can say for some I've tried.  However, after about two months of regular use, the headphones suddenly lost the ability to play any higher pitched tones, and it sounds like I'm listening to music played at the end of a long hallway.<br /><br />I would have given them three stars if I only had to deal with the annoying volume wheel, but breaking after two months downgrades them to a single star.  While I've learned not to set my expectations too high for headphones designed for running, the combination of a cord design that clearly wasn't designed with the movement of running and the short lifespan means that I'll be avoiding this brand in the future."
712,3,"It's all right, I did get some stations but it was to much hassle having to point it do different directions to get different channels, I do live in the city, it may work better for folks living on the countryside."
713,5,"The product fit the need for a pre amp with level control.  The physical size is small, which worked great with the space available."
714,1,"Just like the title, I can't use label to control songs, volume and answer any call. the pungent odour is the big problem, too."
715,5,It was just what we needed to connect to our wall mounted TV because it is so close to the .wall
716,1,The new plugs that came together would not fit together. I had to use my old plug to fit it. The dog chewed up one end of my cord and thank goodness the new one that I ordered fit into mine. But the two plugs that came together did not fit together.
717,1,Comes charged the label is clearly not the same as the manufacturer's which would have been fine if the battery would register in the the remote and if it recharged but it does neither.
718,3,"I have been using Global Sat products strictly on our robots due to the simplicity. They work great with Windows and LInux, and there is no need to manually install the drivers.<br /><br />However, this product does not work well indoors."
719,1,Please do not purchase this item.  The audio cable is garbage and does not work at all with my headphones.
720,5,I got them from a competitor for what I consider a great price. The sound is clean and with good definition throughout the range and spades of bass. There is really no need for a subwoofer with these babies. What I find most impressive is that they sound so good despite me just running them off of a cheap 100 watt (50 / channel) audiosource amplifier that I got on amazon for seventy bucks. They get loud enough with this to make it very uncomfortable to listen to them in the same room.
721,2,None of the locking bolts would lock and where screws had been screwed in were stripped out would not recommend to anybody to buy used I will never buy anything used again used a lot of liquid nail to get it work
722,4,Works great. Really like the keyboard! I would recommecd this to anyone looking for a replacement for their remote.<br />Satisfied customer.
723,3,"Connection came loose after being disconnected only a couple of times - would recommend buying a brand new one instead of refurbished. Doesn't seem to get as many channels as my RCA antenna w/built-in booster, but the mohu also doesn't require a power source, which is a big plus."
724,5,This is an amazing little speaker.  We bought this for my son and he carries it with him everywhere.  The sound quality is excellent and it is even pretty durable... he has dropped it a few times and it continues to work just fine!
725,5,I got my scooter in 2007 and it gave out in 2009.  I recently bought these batteries for my razor e300 and they worked awesome! last forever too!
726,3,"Fairly ordinary for Sennheiser headphones. I'd liken them to any other run-of-the-mill earbuds if not for the twist-to-fit gimmick, which actually works for the most part. I suppose I prefer over-the-ear Sennheiser's more. ."
727,1,I made multiple purchases of this item from multiple AMAZON retailers.  The items I received were not the ''DVI Gear'' brand name.  I have purchased other items in the past that are ''DVI Gear'' brand.  They typically say ''DVI Gear'' on it!  These days they ship you some unknown brand name.  Furthermore the quality of this cable is not of the same quality as the ''DVI Gear'' brand name cable.  You might consider such a business practice to be that of a ''bait-and-switch'' type of strategy.  I would be happy to review the ''DVI Gear'' brand if they would ship it to me.
728,5,"AAA to 9V batteries, NIMH or NICD, charges them all.  I have had one of these for about 5 years.  Still works perfectly.  I bought this one for the camper.  I have told friends about this model and the ones they have bought have also worked perfect.<br />Simple, cheap, does exactly what it is designed to do, long-lasting ... where do you find products like that today?<br /><br />BTW, their rechargeable batteries are also outstanding.  The D size in the 10,000 mAh run forever in between charges."
729,5,It took me a short period of time to mount the TV and it was easy to adjust after the mounting bracket was installed.
730,5,Could see how many batteries my GPS unit will use and did not want to go through so many disposable batteries.  So this is a perfect substitute.
731,5,I am very happy with this product. I got what I was expecting for a good price. thank you very much!
732,1,"cable did not maintain connection to my tablet. if you barely touched the cable, it would lose connection. after 2 weeks, the cable completely died. waste of money."
733,2,"I bought the headphones for my workouts. Price was the only good thing about them. After a few weeks they started falling apart. I tried gluing them together, until one day they fell apart during my workout and zapped my ear, quite painfully. I give an extra start for the bargain price."
734,4,"Woks fine.  Pulls in NBC, ABC, CBS & PBS - even local Pox, 'er, Fox.  Beats paying cable or satellite fees any day."
735,5,I checked the previous reviews before I purchased this radio.  Most were enjoying the radio.  When I received it and turned it on I was pleasantly surprised by the tone and quality.  Great radio for the price.
736,5,"I needed a way to combine all my audio needs at my computer work station. I have a Wi Fi radio, a tape deck, my i-pod, my computer, my SDR for SWL. and my satellite TV, and wanted to control the audio from one place.  I fed this selector into a small (20W) Kinter  Power Amp, and now I can listen to one or more audio feeds since this selector allows for multiple audio sources at the same time. I make sure all sources are approx. the same impedance so there is not too much of a drop in audio level. I usually only have one input selected, but I can quickly see what else is on that is inportant."
737,4,"I used this to hook up an RCA female to Stereo male with my headphones and speakers. Worked well, but it felt fragile when I would take it apart. Hope it doesn't break on me soon."
738,1,this product did not work!<br /><br />I regret not trying it out when I first received it because now its to late to return it!<br /><br />So I have lost $0.00
739,5,"I think it's a wonderful choice, the sound , the size and price. It has worked very nicely. I recommend it."
740,5,"The Sony CDP-CE500 Compact Disc Player is a very good item to purchase and at good purchase price. But, you will have to use an amplifer (I purchase a PYLE - PCA1 stero power 2x15w compact size with good sound features from Amazon)."
741,5,I bought these to tidy up a project I was installing in my home office. The work great and are so easy to install. I would recommend these as a cheap way to add the finishing touches to your install.
742,5,It's very high quality cord.  I agree that the price is quite high for an audio cord but it's very solid and substantial.
743,5,Works really great. Easy to use. A 2 hour charge will almost<br />last 12 hours. Really happy with this product.
744,5,"This is my third HDMI cable and this is my favorite of them all because the cable is much thinner and more flexible than the others.  It's literally half the thickness and stiffness of my other cables and works just the same.  Actually, it works better because one of my thicker cables went out after only a short bit of use."
745,5,"I bought 2 of them for each of my daughters.<br />The design is very nice, and the build quality is also very good.<br />But the most impressive part is the quality of sound, and how loud this could go.<br />It is more than enough for a teenager bedroom."
746,2,"Stopped using it because there is too much background noise added.  Don't know where this is coming from, but playing the cassette in my player I don't hear those sounds."
747,4,The only issue I had is that you can tighten the record player up in the back to make the record sit a certain way and everytime i tighten it it pops back. I am sure I can eventually figure it out but its annoying. However it plays fine.
748,5,It was just what I expected and truly adds life to the audio.  The ability to enhance the voices is really useful for those talky movies where the conversation really counts and/or when the accent is a little different - such as British English.
749,5,"It's a cable folks, either works or doesn't and since mine worked I gave it 5 stars. What else can be said, it's a cable."
750,5,"Works adequately for what I need it for. I use this so that I can connect headphones to the audio out of a camcorder, so that I can confirm a good audio signal from a microphone."
751,5,"So far, so good. We have installed the antenna and have a solid 42 channels scan in without a signal booster. We mounted it outside on the existing satellite pole and were able to turn and tune it fairly easily. I have high hopes for this, since we are cutting cord after years of dissatisfaction with the value of satellite and cable."
752,5,"This tiny little ball is the best speaker for places that do not have music access. Plug it into your cell phone, get Pandora started and listen to hours of music as if you were in your home. LOVE this lil guy. Highly recommend."
753,4,The batteries show a better performance than other betteries I have had. Durace..... Energiz.... however I didn't really enjoy the fact that you have to buy a special charger for this batteries.<br />over all I would say that they are quite good!!!
754,5,Order was shipped promptly and bulb was installed with no problems. Make sure you read the manual for directions since the manual was very detailed. Picture is beautiful again as original bulb lasted 5 years and was dim and not sharp compared to this bulb. I have only had the bulb installed for 4 days but I expect to get many years out of it per the other reviews.
755,5,"i can see many uses for these! wish i could talk to the owner manufacturer!  nice stereo separation , and i hear it very well!!"
756,1,"It makes the screen flickers all the time. Not recommended at all! Not worth it, I guess I will have to spend some more money"
757,5,"Worked great for my 60&#34; Sony. Heavy duty and very sturdy, plenty of screws to choose from for various TV's."
758,5,"Got this during the Deal of the Day special as I'd had my eye on it for some time.  While not an audiophile, I do enjoy good quality video and sound and make good, cost-efficient upgrades when I can.  We're on a fairly tight budget for the next couple years and I had been using my LCD's native speakers for the main TV.  I wanted better quality sound without the cost and fuss of a 5.1/surround system.<br /><br />Extremely happy with my purchase.  Very, very small \\""ding\\"" on the top of the unit which can only be seen from 3-4\\"" away, otherwise unit looks great and was packaged well.  Predictably, lows/mids/highs sound much better vs the LCD's speakers.  The included \\""mini\\"" subwoofer adds some small heft to the sound when the subwoofer itself is turned just about all the way up (separate volume control on the remote).  Living in a condo with a shared wall this sound bar is exactly what I was looking for; fills out the sounds very nicely without being (too) obnoxious.  Occasionally we will have to turn it down somewhat depending on the movie's use of bass.  \\""Surround Sound\\"" feature sounds fuller but our walls are probably too far away to really help that feature (although I still prefer it to the stereo setting).  Clear voice is great as noted in many other reviews.<br /><br />Easy set-up.  Very good sound (great for the price).  Bluetooth would have been great but for the price, who cares!<br /><br />As noted elsewhere, make sure you have Dolby/digital output from your cable/satellite box.  Not only did my TV downgrade the signal, but my cable box was set to put out a poor audio signal.  Easily fixed in the settings.  If I had the $500 or so to spend and the appropriate room set-up, I'd get a surround system.  But I don't have either and this is perfect for my current needs.  Plan on keeping it in the bedroom when we upgrade in a couple years."
759,5,"This product works as described! Extremely high quality cable... and long. I highly recommend this product if you are in the market to replace your Apple iPhone 5 cable.<br /><br />The cable came fast ( w/ Amazon Prime) and in nice, clean, and simple packaging."
760,2,"I  bought this  for  my son  and it didn't work when we first got it.  The product is made from cheap materials, one  side of the headphones didn't work. We truly got what we paid for,  crap!"
761,5,Great size and great sound. This is the second pair I've purchased and I gave these as a gift. He is thrilled with the sound quality and also the finish on the speakers. Couldn't be happier.
762,5,good support...holds my 60 fine.on box it said it had an hdmi cord and a level.niether were present.its my third mount with amazon happy with them all.got to me really fast.
763,1,"Charger doesn't work as advertised for the Nikon Coolpix S3000. Period. Worse yet, I bought a new battery for camera, thinking my battery was the problem and not this dysfunctional charger. I ended up purchasing the following charger from EforCity - eForCity EN-EL10 AC / DC Replacement Battery Charger Set that worked perfectly with original  battery."
764,3,"This is the second one that I've ordered. The first one worked out fine, I just needed another one so that I didn't have to keep using just the one. Its small and easy to keep in your backpack when traveling."
765,3,I find the sound to be muddy.  I expected a little better for the price.  I've been a fan of Polk for a lot of years but this is not one of their better efforts.
766,2,"Bowers & Wilkins, known for its solid sounding bookshelf and floor standing speakers falls short on all fronts with this Wi-Fi Airplay enabled speaker.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Simply put, for the price, it just does not perform as it should.  I had particular difficulty in the setup phase (I run a software company that actually develops connectivity software for USB and Bluetooth enabled devices) as a result of published documentation that differed from the actual setup of the device on my desktop (perhaps due to a firmware update?), but more disappointingly once the device connected to my Wi-Fi the sound would cut-off every several seconds and once it would reconnect, would play for several more seconds before \\""skipping\\"" ahead, presumably to re-sync with the actual playback time on the iPad I was using to stream the supposed, lossless content.  I actually purchased a Wi-Fi extender and connected this device directly to that and had the iPad connected on the same Wi-Fi AP and the problem did not improve at all.  I can see about 5 other wireless SSID's in my suburban neighborhood (in other words, not an crowded apartment, condo or dorm).<br /><br />The sounds - just average for such an expensive product.  Just a single and rather wimpy bass driver to take care of the low's.  B&W literature claims it is a high excursion driver, but when cranked up to about 90% and testing all sorts of USAC SPL tracks, the bass driver did not seem exert any more excursion than my inexpensive Creative Labs computer speakers, and the whole impression overall was that the driver was \\""fighting\\"" to keep up with my music without much \\""oomph\\"" being experienced at all.<br /><br />Perhaps it is a bit unfair, especially coming from a bass junkie, but deep low's are what's needed to help reinforce a quality sound experience - otherwise, how is this any different from your battery powered portable Bluetooth speaker?  And to add insult to injury, the bass is muddied by that small driver that's just trying too hard - and this coming from someone that is not even really that keen on tight bass quality.<br /><br />Now it is one thing for someone to pinch pennies and invest in such an expensive product and come out disappointed, but for someone accustomed to spending this sort of money on electronic products on a regular basis, I feel terribly cheated.  It's not all that different from the feeling I got when listening to that well known speaker brand that packages small cube speakers as a HT setup with a bandpass subwoofer (for you non audiophiles - a sub that has the speaker mounted completely inside a box to use the box itself as a sound filter to exaggerate the bass), but I digress.<br /><br />I won't get rid of it, quite simply because I think it looks stunning.  It sits in my rather pretentious home office overlooking the Hollywood sign along with a bunch of other overpriced, underdelivering products.  I seem to have a knack for spending money on good looking gadgets that are powered by a tad bit of brand reinforced snake oil.<br /><br />To B&W's credit, there is still some real audio engineering going on here (my father's an audio engineer and I used to build speakers with him as a kid) with decent standalone DAC's and a rather novel use of the design to increase the perceived volume by way of an extended port (the aforementioned product uses the same tricks).  And the highs/mids and mid-bass are all decent and not overly bright and tinny sounding despite using dome tweeter.<br /><br />The inconsistency in Airplay connection leaves you with a dock that really needs to rely on a physical connection between an Apple device (or other) - so you've paid for the technology, only you don't really get to use it reliably.  Perhaps it is a fundamental flaw in Airplay itself?  I just tested my Apple TV and I can stream music pretty neatly to my TV speakers - so the flaw has to be in the implementation of the Zeppelin itself (although it could just as well be placement since the Zeppelin and TV are about 20' apart).<br /><br />In the end, this product is made for people with rather low expectations - I've read 5 star reviews from many a happy owner raving about the bass and sound quality.  I'm just being honest - the iPod dock market is not the same folks who will spend twice as much for unpowered bookshelf speakers of the same brand and B&W does not hesitate to throw its brand pedigree at your face with this product that is more circuit board and plastic than quality sound drivers in a good cabinet.<br /><br />Oh well.  If you're like me, you've come to the conclusion that there's not much else in the way of an iPod dock and compact speaker system - if I had to choose between moving my hand signed Starck ashtray and Flos lamp and getting a real speaker system over this compact one, well then, you guessed it, I'll suffer with the rest and keep this in the corner."
767,4,"Just installed this outlet,  like most reviews about similar products, installation was not as easy as it should have been.  I am not an electrician but I certainly know how to replace a receptacle.  Had to drill the hole in the outlet where screw attaches to the outlet box to make it a little wider so I could move receptacle to the right side of the box so the usb connectors would fit in the box. Seems to be working fine, all works and looks good.  Time will tell."
768,5,"Doing a particular project, I must have ordered a dozen different 12 volt DC supplies from Amazon.  I tested them all, loaded them down to the rated current and found no problems with any of them. My first job at Heath Company  ( maker of  Heathkits ) was designing power supplies and VOM's  ( Volt Ohm Meters ).  Much different from now. Power supplies were various voltages,  color codes of wiring were different.  The smallest power supply I designed as a retail product must have weighed 10 pounds.  Am really impressed at today's products.  Some of today's supplies have regulated voltages,  but they do not weigh 10 pounds, thank goodness.  Am glad that the industry has seemed to standardize with 12 volts Dc.  Makes designing projects easier.  Probably makes our prices we pay somewhat lower than without the competition."
769,3,"I do like these clocks and I have already bought one of these clocks for myself. I decided to buy 2 more for gifts to my family.<br />Although I paid full price recieved 2 second hand clocks, both scratched and clearly used. I wouldn't recommend buying these outside of US as postage costs make thes expensive and replacements are not offered only refund which doesn't cover original or replacement shipping. Also beware these are 120v only and require stepdown transformers in many other countries"
770,5,The cable was longer than I needed but worked just fine.<br />The only negative was a broken locking tab on one end<br />but won't interfere with my needs.
771,3,"It works, but could use a little bit more refinement.  Sometimes it loses the connection to the last device it was synced to so you have to reconnect.  Otherwise works great from about 30 ft away and thru several walls in the house."
772,5,I really liked the product recommended 100% I feel totally happy not hesitate to buy recommended ..... sending was done perfectly
773,4,This product works very well when hooked up from my lap top to my television. I'm happy I ordered for it!
774,4,Installed these as replacements in solar lights on my dock.  They came almost fully charged and have continued to keep my solar lights on my dock on all night. (about eight hours)  They work as described and the price was fair.  Shipping was excellent.
775,3,"It work great at first but about 3 months, the left side is gone. It was 81% discount so i didn't expect much. But still, get the new Apple Earpods. $30 but works great and fit well. And if you looking for quality to the extreme, i would recommend checking Bose. That would be all."
776,5,I bought this to go with my Satechi lamp and I am happy I did. It give you a USB port with out taking a way a wall plug. That fact that it has a surge protector built in is great.
777,1,...so I hard a hard time screwing it into the case and when I tried to unscrew it the head sheared off from the wire.  only one use total.
778,4,"I brought this product since I need to built my home theater system. Compare to other brand, it much cheaper but after I install it, it works really great. I love it."
779,2,"The mount for dual screw application wasn't even close to fitting the screw holes on my Klipsch speakers.  They come with drywall screws that I wouldn't trust for 5 lbs, let alone the 12 lbs they claim the unit will hold. In actuality this seems more appropriate for a ceiling mount than a wall.<br /><br />The two units I purchased went in the trash."
780,5,I use this with my Iphone 4s and the free iHandy alarm clock app.  I have a playlist in the app and this little speaker booms it when it goes off.  I love it.  We actually ordered another one for my wife.  Charge you phone all night and have your alarm clock too.  Love it.
781,1,"I must have gotten a defective product, because I can barely hear anything out of this speaker.  I got it to amplify the sound from my phone and it's exactly the same volume.  I put the speakers under the headrest, right next to my ear and still can barely hear it.  My car isn't that loud either.  I'm on Amazon looking for a new speaker to buy (got this one from Radio Shack) and was shocked to come across it with such good reviews. I'd stay away from it, even though it worked for others."
782,1,"not work in my Macbook air 13!!!<br />I can not find reason, well it can work in my wifes Macbook pro 15"
783,4,"No problems whatsoever with this product. If you need an adapter, this is what you were looking for. Buy it."
784,1,"After recieving the charger I plug it into the wall and connected my daughter's tablet to it. The charger does not work. I have put it in every outlet in my apts and my apts is fairly new, so there's not a electrical issue. I put the charger back in the package it came in to sent it back. I will never order anything from that vendor again."
785,2,"Been using this little player for over a month.  So, far, no problems.  Sound i good and great capacity.  I recommend this one.  Suddenly it stopped working. Charged it then tried to start it. Must be the buttons. Plugged into the computer I can load and retrieve, that's all. A pity, I liked it a lot."
786,5,"Great service, it was very easy to use and very straight-forward, It also gave a reasonable time period to complete it in."
787,5,it is as good as my Sony that finally broke after15 yrs...you cant lose if buying this....i have a lot of cassettes
788,5,"This remote, was a perfect replacement to my original remote. while it is slightly bigger, it works like a charm and i love it."
789,5,This prodykt vere good .I don't have a problem with this product.I recomed this product for my frends.Ivere happe.Thank you vere mach
790,4,"My only complaint is that when I roll over in the dead of night to see what time it is, the clock is not backlit. You can tap on the clock to initiate the short, but calming LED lighting, but backlighting would have been a huge plus for me.<br /><br />Otherwise, very happy with the product."
791,5,"Actually, I brought this model on Amazon but, I was upgraded to the AVR2313 because, they were out of stock.  No complaints on this receiver. Works will with the BIC America In-Wall speakers i brought to go with the receiver."
792,4,"Works great with our Ipod touch 4th generation.  I like the feature of charging it up and using the battery for when I'm outside or out on the boat, etc. however, the battery life seems short.  I've only used the battery once and perhaps it wasn't fully charged, but it only lasted a handful of songs until it died.  Good sound quality and I really like this speaker set!"
793,5,These are the best headphones for the price out there. I have had several pair over in the past. Ilisten to recorded books
794,5,A three pack for cheap. They worked in Italy for all my devices. Nothing else to say. 5 stars. I'd say so :)
795,1,Bought this item for work/Office. It was just to weak to maintain a signal. Really poor quality reception. Very disappointed especially after reading so many positive reviews. Thank goodness for amazon return policy or I would have been very upset about the purchase
796,1,"THE SOUND IS VERY BASSY, BASS ALL OVER, NOT A TRUE SOUND. DO NOT RECOMMEND. SONY OR PANASONIC ARE BETTER, THEY GIVE YOU A TRUE SOUND, NOT LIKE THIS ONE FROM KOSS, NOT WORTH IT."
797,4,Lightweight with good sound at a low price. Beats the lousy earphones you get on airplanes with their digi players.
798,5,"I love these, they fit comfortably. We got a couple of them and we are very pleased. Thanks a lot!"
799,5,"Best head phones, dr.dre is known for making music, not speakers! My work out is much better now. If you are using it with an iPhone download a equalizer app."
800,5,Love this iPod!!! It has bigger storage and has the radio!!! Yipe!!! It can sync with your Nike running shoes and your blue tooth in the car. All very cool. Has the new apple connecter so you may need to by an adapter to use it with older docking systems. $29 from apple or rip off version for a couple of bucks else where on line. The ear buds are good too. Oh its smaller than my old model so need a new arm band carrier eventually.
801,4,"Well, this is not the best sounding headphones I had in these price range, but over all it has a good sound quality and it looks sturdy. I've been running with it and it is comfortable."
802,4,"I bought this for my Energy 5.1 Speakers and Sony Receiver. I used it with RCA 16 Guage wire.<br />Though i find it pricey they are very well build with a great finish. They are also pretty after the install as there is no wire peeking out after the install.<br />I cant speak of the quality or improvement in sound with these vs bare wire. However i can say this much, banana plugs are a must have atleast on the receiver end without which it is difficult to handle the wires.<br />I figured the right amount of the wire to be cut is about 6-8mm any more they will cause a problem while screwing it up.<br />To spread the wire i started from the edge and spread them around evenly untill i reached the center wires which i folded to the side that had thinner distribution. Even distribution of wire around the neck is a key for good contact."
803,5,I bought a coverage for my Samsung TV of 3 years and now I feel much safer :)<br /><br />Not sure how this is going to work in the end but atleast a piece of mind.
804,2,"At first, I was extremely impressed. The pairing is flawless and easy.<br /><br />But the instructions are not written by a native English speaker, and following them to a T doesn't seem to charge the unit.  Perhaps the battery just doesn't function properly.  The big problem is that it doesn't really tell you when it's charging, and it doesn't tell you when it's charged.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE is I tried to charge it several times today, a couple hours each time.  Then I plug it in and pair and I get the disturbing 3 beeps every 30 seconds that indicates the battery is dead.<br /><br />Can someone tell me why this even needs to charge?  I keep it plugged in all the time.  There is no reason a decent product shouldn't operate when it's plugged in even if it sometimes needs to be charged.<br /><br />At the moment, I'm calling this product useless."
805,5,"These are the headphones I use daily with my home computer.  Not really an audiophile but I'm very impressed with the sound at this price range and they're never uncomfortable even after hours of nonstop listening.  The volume control is also convenient.  The headphones were purchased just about a year ago and are used daily by multiple people in the house, and while we're not overly abusive to the headphones, they do occasionally fall, but they still work and look the same as when purchased.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very happy with these headphones, didn't hesitate to get another one when they were on sale as the deal of the day, and have no desire to replace these with anything under $100."
806,5,"Product is exactly as it was described. Looks great, Turntable, CD, Radio And Aux input all work perfectly and it sounds great too! I would definitely recommend this player to anyone I know."
807,4,"It took a bit to getting it working. I needed to plug my charger into the open port as it was not operating until I did, once it had power coming in it was functioning. It occasionally lags and the video quality goes out the door, but that happened only once or twice during the film. Other than that it's very close to DVD quality on my TV, if not slightly better. It would be nice if it didn't need a power source coming into the adapter in order to operate. That makes the mobile usage a little impractical because i'm not going to lug my charger with me everywhere in case I want to show something on the TV to friends. I like the adapter because sometimes digital movies are actually cheaper to purchase than their dvd physical disc equivalent, ex. I purchased the amazing spider-man for $3.99 from HTC Watch app versus $14.99 on dvd or google play (prices at the time of purchase). So, if you're thinking of using it at home or plan on taking extra charging cables with you everywhere than this is a great product. If you wanted this for impromptu gatherings to showcase slideshows, movies, etc then it's not that practical. Maybe i'm just picking in that case, but I love nonetheless."
808,5,"after reading others' reviews, selected this one, was blown away by the sound, very satisfied with this purchase, highly recommend"
809,1,I t does not work with our Mitsubishi 3d TV. Worst waste of money ever. Do not buy unless you know for sure it will  work.
810,4,"There are so many Pros & a few Cons (see previous reviews), but the only thing I really have a problem with doesn't seem to be a negative for any of the other reviewers - and here it is: you only get 5 minutes on snooze!! My previous alarm gave an option for 10, 20 or 30 minute reprieve. The only other comment I would make is to agree with the others - The English portion of the manual needs a re-edit by someone with a better command of the language."
811,1,"This Mohu Leaf Paper thin antenna is not for everybody. I tried multiple rooms, but only go 3 channels max. It's most likely my area. Since I also have issues getting any kind of signal for my cell phones on 2 different networks.  I suggest trying out the product if possible, as it may work for you."
812,5,"Very simple product, I bought it for relieving eyestrain when watching TV or Movies in the dark. Works as advertised.& Highly recommended by Home theatre enthusiasts as a bargain for enhancing TV picture quality & for fine tuning color calibration."
813,5,"The headphones are very portable and can be folded into the size of a can of Coke. The isolation is a good balance between keeping the music in and the world out. They provide enough outside feedback to keep you from being totally deaf to hazards (being run over by car). They would make poor headphones for a long plane ride.<br /><br />They look good on your head and won't bring unwanted attention. They can be plugged directly into an iPod. The headphones are at a price point ($50.00) that if lost or broken would not be the end of the world. For a small closed headphone, they produce great sound.<br /><br />I keep the Senn PX200's in my bag as a backup and replacement for my in-ear monitors. If I'm having discomfort or fatigue issues with the monitors, I replace them with the Senn PX200's. The PX200's take up very little room in my bag.<br /><br />The other pair of headphones I would look at in the portable, over-ear and closed category would be the Senn HD25's. The HD25's are larger and provide more isolation. The HD25's are at a size that comes closer to attention getting. The HD25's are four times the price. The HD25's are superior sounding.<br /><br />I own, use and enjoy both the Senn PX200's and the HD25's. If I had the money and wanted only one pair, I would buy the HD25's. Neither headphone is very good for runners or people engaged in athletic activities."
814,5,"These look and sound great.  I put them in a 20x10 media room and they sound perfect for the room.  If you are a audiophile then look elsewhere, but for the majority of us out there these will do the job great.  For the price these are a great buy."
815,5,"Hard to beleive the power and clarity that comes out of this system. Comparable to very high dollar systems similar to Bose, PSB or Klipsch at a fraction of the cost The design looks great and draws compliments everytime someone sees it in my office.Sensitive finger touch control on the side speaker or from desktop. Overall - WOW."
816,5,"I bought two for separate room sound systems. I already own a Klipsch speaker and sub 9.1 sound system in my main home theater room so I was pleased with their sound and build quality. I purchased these on sale and glad I did. These have everything to fill out the bottom octaves and sound great in my two secondary room sound systems. UPS shipping did damage one of the sub's grill but seller is ordering a replacement. For the money, I don't think you can buy anything better."
817,5,You have to love monoprice equipment for the price these are hands down the best.<br /><br />Easy to install and I have had zero issues with putting my speakers in.
818,5,"I'm amazed at the sound quality with such a small speaker! I wouldn't suggest it for a large space or noisy environment, but works great in quiet room."
819,5,"Great battery life, awesome sound, super range - these speakers have all this and more. I made sure that they had a full charge before using for the first time. The induction charging base is really convenient and cuts down on cables. I placed each speaker on a different floor of my home - signal had to bounce around corners and up and down stairs - which it did with zero problem. I didn't pace out the distance, but three floors in a 3,000 sqr/ft property is good in my book. Sound is super at both ends of the range. Battery lasted (at least) all evening 4 hours+ before i returned the speakers to the charging base. Very happy with my wireless speakers!"
820,4,I have about 50 tapes from my days of being in various bands.<br />I still like to listen to the music we created.<br />This device makes it effortless.
821,4,"These headphones are decent but I do not like how they fit in my ears.  I think they are shaped awkwardly... the oval shape does not fit my ear canal causing background noise to leak in.<br /><br />On the plus side they are cheap, they provide good quality music and stay in my ears when I run and ride my bike."
822,5,i have a tens unit and was looking for a small 9 volt charger<br />found it works great and 2 batteries came with it
823,4,I Bought them for my mother who is hard of hearing.  She likes them and finds them easy yo use.
824,1,"I bought these for somebody else and just found out that the wrong product was delivered - when I called my friend he needed to remove his earbuds to talk to me. I asked why and that's when he told me there was no microphone - I drove over to check them out and realized they weren't the headphones I ordered.<br /><br />Previously when I posted this review Amazon refused to allow it, however it DOES fall within the guidelines:<br /><br />• Your review should focus on SPECIFIC FEATURES of the product and your experience with it.<br /><br />The description of this product (SPECIFIC FEATURES) specifically states that it has a microphone - the product received does not have a microphone or carrying bag, and does not have the strong cables described (it did come with the set of 6 eartips).  It is NOT an MEElectronics product - I regularly use a set of SB51's so I know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />Be careful if you purchase this product from AndrewSet"
825,3,"Happy enough with the remote. When it works, it works well. Moving through menus is a bit slow. Main problem is with the RF. Never works 100%. Bought a second remote (first one died after a couple of years - screen was going weird) so ended up with second base station + receivers. Set both base stations/receivers up so would have coverage across the width of the cabinet where all my gear is stored. Thought this might resolve issues where RF would fail (cross symbol shown on remote) but still get the odd failure... Would have gone with another option if I hadn't spent ages getting it working with my MediaPortal installation."
826,5,"I am a first time owner of a record player. I'm from the CD/MP3 generation, with parents in the vinyl generation. I became interested in vinyl records seeing that some of my favorite artists still recorded on vinyl. I thought buying this item and records in the future would make for some valuable collectables. I want to break my ratings down in to record/CD/player & AM/FM, speakers, and delivery & setup.<br /><br />Record player, CD player, Cassette player, & AM/FM players all work great. Very impressed with the design and the ease of usage on this item also. just plug it in, throw on the record and crank the volume. Rugged design, doesn't seem like it will break any time soon. 10/10<br /><br />The speakers are great, but they don't blow me away. I can sense the bass, they are clear and plenty loud enough. 9/10<br /><br />This item was delivered in approximately 7 days, as I chose the free shipping. Happy with the speed of the delivery, package came and nothing was broken. Like I said before, I took it out, plugged it in, and cranked it up. 10/10<br /><br />I love this thing so far. It gives me a reason to spend money A.K.A. support my favorite bands. No static, this thing sounds great. Also for the price, you can NOT beat this thing on the market.  I will recommend this to any body."
827,5,Nice and compact with tons of great sound that is crystal clear. Easy to move from room to room or to travel with. Highly recommend it.
828,4,"Everything was great. I really likes the headphones, They can hurt your ear a little. They just need to be maneuvered."
829,5,nice features on this remote.. Came as promised.. the keypad on the back of the remote is mighty spiffy... 5 stars
830,5,"The instructions weren't very clear.  Look it up online if you don't have your original user manual for the tv any longer.<br /><br />Other than that, the product is working fine so far.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it lasts for a few years."
831,5,I buy lots of cheap cables and never had a problem. No need to spend top dollar on cables. Its digital. It either works or is doesn't. And these work.
832,5,"This amp is a great value. Fiio makes solid, budget conscious products for all audio enthusiasts and the E12 certainly doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />The build is outstanding and probably the best I've seen come out of the Fiio labs. Its a rock solid aluminum body, reinforced audio jacks, a volume knob that wont break anytime soon, while still maintaining an elegant design with it's tapered edges. It has a nice heft to it, in a good way. Almost makes me feel comfortable with the fact that I might drop it one day. I think it can take it, no problem.<br /><br />The bass boost, although very slight, is impressive. Definitely not \\""bloated\\"" like the E11, the way some people might feel. The background noise is almost non-existent, even with IEMs. The dual OPAMP makes for some very clean audio reproduction. Is it portable?? Yes and no. But I think with the amount of upgrades that were made to the E11, the size is more than acceptable.<br /><br />Battery life?? It ran for well over 12 hours at about 80% volume burning in a pair of headphones with ease. The micro usb charging port is a big bonus since that is the standard now.<br /><br />Also, this thing is POWERFUL. Able do drive some very demanding headphones, such as my Beyerdynamics, with ease.<br /><br />My advice: Buy it. Its a great value. Don't fall into the idea that you need a ridiculously expensive amp for good sound quality. If you own headphones ranging in price of $80-$300 like I do, then this falls nicely into that price range for a portable amp."
833,5,Sounds great price is amazing would be hard to find anything better<br />for its price very happy with this center speaker.
834,4,"I am running this bridged to power some entry way ceiling speakers off of our church sound system.  I just needed a low end amp at a reasonable cost.  This amp meets the need, very simple, just powers some low quality ceiling speakers."
835,4,Decent wire for the price in a nice big spool.  Without getting into expensive high end speaker wire you can't go wrong with this stuff.
836,4,"I didn't need anything special, and it works well when connecting my phone to my TV. My brother's have actually used this more than me with their phones, and I haven't heard any complaints from them."
837,3,"These were not quite what I expected ,but I think I can get them to work with my system, The price was great."
838,5,"As the search results for HDMI cables on Amazon.com demonstrate, there is a huge variance in prices on HDMI cables. I am sure some tech-phile could discern the difference between the no-name cheap version and the exorbitant Monster cables that can run $100 or more.<br />Me personally, I don't buy that. Sure, I didn't want a flimsy cable that looked to suffer from shoddy manufacturing. But I wasn't going to overpay for a cable. That is when I stumbled across the BlueRigger brand of HDMI cables. I purchased several of these HDMI cables in lengths ranging from 6-15 ft.<br />I have not had one problem since using these cables, whether it is for my Blu-Ray player, my Roku, or just connecting my laptop to any one of several devices that support HDMI technology. I have had no losses, no fuzziness, nothing.<br />Reasonably priced, solid construction . . . everything I was looking for in a cable. I have already and would buy from BlueRigger again."
839,4,"I like this product, I'm an amateur beginning listener to vinyl.. I was looking for a sharp looking versatile record player and found this. I was reluctant because of other poor reviews, but the price seemed right! So I gave it a shot.<br /><br />Great simple machine.<br /><br />Incredibly easy to set up, a nice sound for a small room, and a nice looking player!"
840,1,"i just got my earphone and actually it is the first time i actually write review on amazon.<br />  senheiser is a well known earphone brand and i can not believe it produces such poor mid and high, even for the bass, it is even worse than cx 200.  and for senheiser the higher the series the better the sound quality it produces, also when u volume up it just<br /><br />mid and high distortion and the low power of bass<br /><br />chord sound---- i have used it for 2 days and its right side has extreme chord sound, i am going to return it right now!<br /><br />for 185$ price label? clearly it is knock off. for 31$ buy in?  please forgive to say it- it is a knock off for 31$ earphone.<br /><br />forgive me to say it again : i have bought knock off bose ie-2 product before, and i am pretty positive that the unit from senheiser sounds similar with the unit from my fake bose ie-2 !<br /><br />if amazon or whatever refuse to return my product, i am going sue them for selling knock off on internet."
841,5,"I bough this for my Zen Mosaic MP3 player so as to have a portable sound system and, boy, does it work much better than I had imagined. All too many times, I have forgot to start the vehicle and, consequently, have drained the battery. Not anymore. Although I haven't used it for longer than about 8 hours, the battery endured for that entire time without requiring charging.<br /><br />The sound emanating from this tiny package is unreal. It is very crisp, clear and the bass tone is perfect."
842,5,"Tried it out for my 13 hours plane ride, blocks most sounds and had quality movie and sleep time. Just wish it is less expensive."
843,3,"hard to use  I dont know why i have to write more to get this in, it is stupid and makes many now want to even write"
844,2,"The audio quality is ok for these headphones but the biggest drawback that I had with these is the fact that they are beyond uncomfortable after like 20 minutes of having them on and I dont like the wire that much, it feels like it can easily just tear, very plastic all over quality. I wouldnt recommend them to a friend at all, I would rather just spend a little more money and get some decent headphones around the 40-50 dollar range if you want them to last!"
845,5,"This speaker is great, I bought it at Staples for $20 but first checked the review here. Using with macbook pro, makes movies sound 10x better."
846,4,Very Pleased with these speakers. I have them included in my 5.1 Surround Sound and they have amazing bass and real good mid and high
847,4,This is copper clad aluminum wire so that's why I went with 14 Gauge instead of 16 Gauge.  It pulls well through tubing and floor joists and has low electrical resistance.
848,1,"The mini HDMI doesn't fit well  into the computer slot very loose, if it moves it take for ever to get it working again"
849,5,My wife got the screen protector @ Att store when she got her phone. Didn't found out later they made a case for it as well. Definitely liking so far.
850,4,"this HDMI cable accomplished what it was supposed to do by connecting two other devices, arrived promptly and was inexpensive."
851,1,Sound quality is pathetic at best.  Did not work with my LightScribe at all.  I do not recommend this product or seller.
852,5,"I did purchase this cables to connect My Facusrite Safire Liquid 56 to other audio hardware. Is working perfect, I'm very pleased with quality."
853,5,"Bought this to use temporarily in my \\""sports car\\"" since it doesn't have any mp3 ports (or cupholders for that matter) it's strictly a sports car.  I was using my smartphone to listen to Pandora but I missed my mp3 player with songs of choice.  Found most of the reviews for the Kinivo positive and for the price how can anything go wrong.  And it didn't, yet.  I'm not a sound snob.  I can't tell what's a high or low.  All I know is I need a mini speaker to sound loud and not distorted when the volume is turned up.  The fears were there when I hit the \\""buy\\"" button.  Will the bass sound like those pos annoying cars that rattle with every thump.  Will the treble sound like it's turned all the way up with no bass.  That's all that I'm concerned with.  And after hearing this in the house and in a moving car (with aftermarket exhaust and headers) I'm convinced I had made the right purchase at the price level I wanted to pay.  My only gripe is the way too short cord that connects the speaker to your electronic device.  I will have to look for an adapter to extend.  Yes I could've bought a different brand with a longer cord but the way the Kinivo ZX100 sits on four legs it's sturdy in a moving vehicle where as a cylinder shape would be rolling somewhere on the floor at the first turn.  Also, I thought having a bit of color would be a nice change from the black, and black, and black of most other brands.  I even tested the Kinivo against another cylinder shaped brand my coworker had.  I don't remember the brand but they said it was about $10 more.  Honestly, I couldn't tell much difference.  Both sounded great.  Someone commented both sounded \\""full\\"".  I was then again satisfied I made the better $ purchase.  The fact that you don't have batteries to change is a plus.  This thing has been going for hours.  Someone commented on theirs lasting 4 hours but I think I've logged more than that.  It has volume controls which some do not also.  Great buy."
854,5,Polk makes a great product. I always like Polk quality. I will buy more Polk speakers.Looking forward to getting a powered sub woofer soon.
855,5,"I boutht this for my son's xBox 360 and it works great!  Just don't forget to remove the rubber cover before connecting, I did :)"
856,4,"I would highly recommend these headphones, they are one of the only pairs I have ever owned that do not give me headaches, even after several hours of use."
857,5,"After my dog ate my remote for my Phillips sound system, i realized that there were absolutely no remote codes for the product. You can find a remote code to turn the volume up and down, however without power it was useless. So hence i needed a remote to turn it on, enter this remote. It sucks having to spend $30+ on a remote, but its better than buying a new sound system."
858,2,After I received this item I realized it was for the small jawbone and I have the larger version. I returned it and requested either the larger version or a refund and have heard nothing in response.
859,5,Perfect and sturdy replacement chord.  I recommend this to anyone looking for a replacement for their Seinhesser.  The price of the chord beats braving to buy new phones.
860,2,"Purchased the flipper for a person with Dementia that had problems with remotes with a bunch of buttons.  Just wanted one that would turn off the cable box & TV together, change channels and volume.  It does turn off Cable box but leaves TV on.  It does change channels, but you have to pause between channels, if you push the channel button to fast when going through the channels it messes up.  It does great on controlling the volume though. The Flipper is a good idea but needs some more tweaking."
861,4,"I bought this because I didn't feel that I needed all the bells and whistles found on some of the other players.  I just wanted a small, powerful player that sounded great I found it."
862,5,I love that it holds so many CDs/DVDs. Nice quality and sturdy with a fun exotic design. Perfect for my car or home use. I recommend.
863,5,Very pleased with item worked great was what I expected love it very much came sooner than expected would order again from this person.
864,5,"This little speaker came packed in a jelly jar.  Took it out and mated it with my ipad.  All I can say is wow, what sound.  I did not expect it to sound so full!"
865,5,"i have never had any problems with the amazon basics. so far i think i have bought about 7 of these for 700 disc and have never<br />had a bad disc, knock on wood!"
866,5,"This is not a complaint just a few tips to note when you get this mount:<br />- You will need to loosen the joints or use a WD-40 pin on them because this bad boy is stiff and will not swing easily.<br />- Take the plastic end caps off the nuts until you are finished mounting.<br /><br />The only bad part of this mount is that the bottom hole is not just a hole its about an inch long horizontal slot.  This can't be a pain in the butt to get it to align, and if it is not very tight it will move on the wall when the tv swings.  I think they should have just made this a single hole in my opinion!<br /><br />Overall this mount is great worth the price and then some."
867,5,"It fills the bill for my wife.  She wanted something she could plug her headphones in.  Needless to say, it worked."
868,2,"Awesome Things About These Earbuds:<br />+ Great sound quality for all types of music<br />+ Extremely comfortable, 6 pairs of interchangeable ear gels and 2 cone shaped ear gels<br />+ Fits firmly in ears and stays<br />+ High Quality flat cord never tangles<br />+ Nice fabric pouch with sturdy metal clasp<br />+ Comes with removable clip that holds cord in place<br />+ Quality microphone makes Skype-ing/calls possible<br /><br />These high quality buds arrived in a nice box with everything I needed to customize them perfectly for my ears. They capture both bass and tenor very well. All my music and movies sound great with these. For storage, I can just shove them in the pouch, the thick flat cord does not tangle.<br /><br />Update 3/9/2013: One ear bud just stopped working. I really loved these while they lasted and treated them well so I am very disappointed that only one works now. Since they were so short-lived, I have to take off 3 stars."
869,4,"The  iPod shuffle works fine. It got here in good time. I'm happy with the product, as it holds plenty of music"
870,5,I looked at a lot of antennas before settling on this one.  The customer reviews were a big help.  It seemed to be the best fit for our needs.  We wanted one that could be mounted in the attic and could pick up the signals from the towers in Atlanta (we're about 30 miles west of them).  I'm pleased to say that we're getting a crystal clear picture on 21 stations.  The signal package seems to briefly interrupt from time to time - not sure if an amplifier would improve that or not - but being able to say goodbye to the cable company is wonderful (I'll still keep them for the high speed internet only because there isn't a better alternative at present).
871,4,"the edges are not straight and the level that is built in wll not let you hang it square,but still a great value&#62;&#62;&#62;"
872,1,"there seems to be something wrong with the wire - i need to keep it in a particular position for me to get music in both the speakers. this product has now been sent to India as a gift. So, not sure how to go about getting this rectified."
873,4,"Sound is very good for this device. Radio works very good. Although pretty standard, the ipod dock could be better as far as accessibility and fit."
874,5,"No problems whatsoever. The price is excellent, the product supports a lot of electronics at once. Cable is thick and reliable-feeling."
875,5,"This was a great purchase and an awesome price for this replacement remote control. I got the TV free from a relative, but just had to get a new remote! Great purchase, fast delivery."
876,5,My daughter loves these earphones...I used them for my computer work late at night as everyone else is trying to sleep.
877,4,The device worked just as promised. I was able to get my payper view and on demand movies working. this was an easy way to fix an expensive problem. Thanks
878,1,"I am amazed that you Amazon do business with a company that sends your customers faulty products. I unpacked the product and assembled it, placed it when I would enjoy it the most and when I turned it on it was great. However, when I tried to operate the stereo with the remote control................NOTHING HAPPENED!<br />THANKS FOR NOTHING!<br />Arthur B. Villwock"
879,1,"I wanted to buy what's on the picture, but instead I have 50 useless adapters because they only fit into European outlets.  I would like to get a refund considering I can't use any of them and it isn't what is shown in the picture."
880,5,I have used little ear buds of all types and am forever having to adjust them in order to keep them in my ears.  Not so with these headphones.  Just put them on and they stay right there.  I never have to touch them.  And I can hear the sounds around me quite well since they're not in the ears.  I run the cord down under my t-shirt to the phone on my hip.  I have two pairs of these headphones (for my two locations) and use them almost every day.  Very happy with them.
881,2,"The NAXA NRC Digital Alarm Clock refuses to remain on the station I selected; e.g. I attempted to listen to KVOD in Denver, CO, FM 90.1.  I had a difficult time keeping the station at 90.1...shortly after, however, it began to 'creep' to 90.2 then 90.3 until the station was reduced to static.  Being able to listen to a radio is the whole idea of buying one - this product is unacceptable."
882,5,"Best HDMI cable for the money.  Well made, and kink free. I've bought 2 of them, and may need some more. Highly recommend them for 25ft runs."
883,2,They looked like a great idea but do not work well.  I found them awkward and difficult to work with.
884,5,It's a coaxial wall plate.  Not much can be said other than it was cheap and exactly what I needed.
885,5,"We tend to do a lot of road trips with our kids, and we use a nice headrest mount for our Ipad.  The sound from the ipad tends to be too quiet for the boys to hear in the back seat, and our car doesn't have build-in bluetooth or a cassette deck.  In the past we've been forced to use different kinds of wired portable speakers, but finding a decent place to put wired speakers was a pain.  This little bluetooth speaker had really great sound and we didn't have to deal with a tangle of cords to set it up.  We could easily move it further back in the car so the boys could hear their movies but we didn't have to deal with the sound too much in the front-seat.  Turns out, it fits perfectly the cup holder for their car seats.  No issues with battery life on a 3 hour car trip with constant use.  Definitely recommend this product!"
886,4,It is always nice to have a mobile Surge Protector with you for your travels or cons that you attend and with this device it really is all you need. It provides 3 outlets and 2 usb slots. I don't really use the usb portion of this device as when it comes to charging devices I just rather use the standard ac plug that comes with the device itself and plug it into one of the 3 outlets. Some problems I have with it as yes it is mobile though the term &#34;Mini&#34; is not really what comes to mind to descirbe this as it is pretty fat. Gratned it is small though &#34;Mini&#34; it is not. Also with the rotating plug on the device can be a little hard to adjust to where you want it though I don't use this device much except for when it is convention season.<br /><br />I recommend this product to those that travel a lot and want to have a couple of extra AC outlets with them just in case there isn't enough at your hotel or at any conventions you might be at as it is small enough take with you though know that it is a little fat so pack accordingly.
887,5,These headphones deliver high quality and for a very low price.  And Koss always stands behind their products! Great company
888,5,"Este receiver lo mejor por 300 dolares<br />Comprelo sin duda lo mejor por este precio,<br />absolutamente confiable la transaccion<br />Es un excelente producto, conexion a internet,"
889,1,"Luckily, COMCAST switched it out for free.  Would never have worked with my current cable box.  I ordered the silver remote but received the gray/pewter one."
890,5,"I bought this for two reasons: Music and it's small. Yes, the thing that got me hooked when I saw my niece with one was the size. I know others like a bigger device but small fit my needs. I have plenty of other devices for video but for me I was looking for a small device, fit in the shirt pocket and this worked. First nano I ever bought, surprised how much music I could fit on here, the audio quality with the ear-buds work very well. No complaints.<br /><br />As far as the buttons, and touch control. No problems at all. Easy to read/see and buttons are easy to press. I just love this thing. If music is your thing then I highly recommend this. It is a bit pricey though."
891,5,"sometime this alarm does not wake me up, I guess i'm to sound a sleeper, it does wake the wife up and she can get me up lol"
892,4,"I got this alarm clock after my old Emerson failed me. Failed as in the daylight saving time was set to the old standard and twice a year I had to manually changed it and that day I was late to work.<br /><br />I read several reviews and opted for this simple one and paid extra for the color I wanted.<br /><br />Pro:<br />- Easy to operate<br />- Gentle on the eyes (I find green is better than blue or red)<br />- Dual alarm for my spouse and I<br />- Large numbers<br />- Compact<br /><br />Con:<br />- Dim (I read about the light intensity and I do agree it's dim, I prefer it dim but even I think it would have a larger range instead of dim or dimmer)<br />- Small off button mixed with other buttons (but it's concave so not too difficult to find)<br />- Buzzard weak (I read it was more of a peeper and it's true, not the abrasive sound I've grown to love)<br />- On knob delicate, to easy to turn by mistake, I liked the slider (but if stiffer with a click would be fine)<br /><br />I have used it for several months now and I would order again, found the same model at target also."
893,5,"The ear buds came with multipel sized gels to change so they fit my 6 year old daughter as well as my 13 year old son, the sound is also great, I will be ordering a set for all 4 of my kids in there favorite team. No more fighting over who's ear phones are who's."
894,4,Works fine but keep in mind there are only three battery-protected outlets. The other three are surge only. Plugged the USB cable into my Mac. It detects the unit properly and my Mac's UPS service default settings are perfect for me. I using this to replace a Cyberpower UPS which fried on me after seven months.
895,5,Other rechargeable batteries don't seem to have a high enough voltage to stop my camera from a premature death by power loss. These Eneloop batteries are terrific. Long life during use or just storing the batteries in the camera with power turned off.
896,5,A little pricy but an excellent investment for the &#34;thunder capital&#34; of the U.S. (central Florida) - feel a little more secure with my electronics...
897,5,a gift which allows you to set the time yourself without having it done automatically so you can be 5 minutes ahead
898,4,This is an OK Radio.I expected better and louder sound.I do wish I ordered the CD Player as well. Don't know if I can add this CD player to the Radio
899,2,cNet gave this a very high recommendation so I purchased for home use.  Very surprised upon receipt. Did not fit well and the sound was nothing special -- about the same as a pair of $39.99 in-ear buds. My old etymiotics and shure models much better. Would not recommend at this price point.
900,5,"Received very fast, works as described, no problem in pairing with my HTC Desire Z (T-Mobile G2).<br />Charges very fast too."
901,3,The touch screen is either extremely sensitive or the mp3 is defective. It will randomly try to recalabirate itself everytime you try to change a setting or add items.
902,4,These are the best case I could find for DVDs that allowed me to have the original movies fact sleeve. Great to keep the DVD/blueray/ extra discs all together. The tab to close doesn't hold we'll when taking the case in and out if my storage box so I just fold the tab inwards- works great.
903,5,"Worked great for passing cords through a wall into another room.  One room is cold, the other is warm so using one of these on each side did a great job of letting me pass the cabling through without ugly holes and cold air blowing in."
904,5,"I was initially a little daunted by the number of protector sheets provided, but once I sat down with the Motorola to apply them, it became easily obvious where each was to go. I am QUITE impressed with the quality of manufacture and the PERFECT fit of each piece. Also impressed by the full side coverage the product gives, not covering just the touchscreen face, but the sides and the back bezel, too!<br /><br />Easy to apply, and easy to smooth using the tool provided. I'll order from you again.<br />DAB"
905,5,"I received these for Christmas so my review is not a verified one but these are so stellar I had to write a review anyways.<br /><br />One of the first things you will notice about these is they do not need to hook to a normal stereo to work like most other headphones.  You can hook them to any device (HDTV, DVD, computer, TiVo, Xbox, etc...) that has a toslink optical audio output.  You can also hook them up with standard red/white RCA cables but then you don't get the advanced sound with dolby digital.  I have mine hooked to my TiVo, Xbox 360 and BluRay player with a 3 way optical splitter.<br /><br />Let me say that I am a headphone person and have used MANY MANY headphones over the years and these can match the sound quality of any of them.  Crisp highlights, good bass and the headphones cover your ears completely blocking out most outside noise.  Of course sound quality varies for each person but I am very happy with it.<br /><br />The wireless distance is OK but not the longest.  They work perfect in my living room and a little down the hall but when I am in my kitchen, roughly 30-35 feet the sound gets spotty.  The same when I go to my computer room, you have to stand on one side to keep the signal active.<br /><br />I have 2 different wifi routers in my home, one two feet from the base unit, and notice no wifi interference at all.  My iPhone and laptop have no problem connecting and staying connected when using these. I am adding this as I see some reviews stating the opposite."
906,5,It was the right product that I was expecting. Perfect for my Onkyo! I love it and recommend it to everybody.
907,5,I haven't attached these to the wall yet but i have mounted one the the speaker and let me tell you. For the money there is no way you can beat them.
908,2,the hdmi curves towards my tv not away from it. doesn work on my 24&#34; sony or my 60&#34; samsung
909,3,station tuner turns very hard and does not receive nearly as many stations as my small sony..would not buy again
910,5,This item arrived quickly.  It arrived in excellent condition.  It worked exactly like it was supposed to.  The item met a special need very well.  Thank you Amazon for having it.
911,5,This is a very fine product for those wanting a good AM/FM/MW/LW and SSB radio.  The receiver is one of the best that I have every heard.
912,3,"This remote works well with all of my devices, but it is very difficult to use because the navigation pad (the round area with the arrows) is way too small and I often click the OK button in the middle while I am trying to navigate.  Vice-versa, sometimes I try and hit the OK/Select button and I press one of the arrows instead.  My fingers are not big, so it isn't a matter of me having fat fingers.  The navigation circle is just too small.<br /><br />Aside from the above issue, the remote is okay.  The backlight function operates fine, although the Channel Preset and Guide buttons' icons are not backlit because the buttons are red instead of being able to be lit from behind like the other keys, which is a strange choice.<br /><br />Overall it is an average, inexpensive remote that is hindered by the navigation pad being too small."
913,2,"I chose this because of high reviews and the length of the cord is awesome, however mine failed, and I am not as impressed as I was upon buying it"
914,5,"Good solid product at a good price. I used these to connect the antennas on two Shure SLX receivers. They have been operating well, and this is much cheaper than buying Shure's kit if you already have multiple single receivers and need to connect them. We also had the BNC cables so this was a no brainer."

916,5,The product fully addresses my requirements and i would recommend it to anybody with similar requirements. Please keep it up.
917,1,This was a piece of junk I could easily rip apart with my hands.  I wanted something for use with a phone and an earpiece.  The cords with 3 sections on the male side carry audio only.  I just threw away in the garbage can after it arrived.<br /><br />There are a lot of bees going around.  You have to get the kind with four sections on the male part to use as an earpiece plug in for use with and earpiece and a phone.  The cords with only 3 sections on the male piece will carry audio only.
918,5,"i loaded this myself with music and use it in my car all the time.  i wouldn' consider myself a techie girl, so it's easy to use and has been durable.  my mp3 slot in the car hangs out the front of the dashboard and it's been whacked byt he kids more than once.. still works!"
919,3,"These were much bigger than I thought they would be.  On the positive side they are thick, great quality, and have a hard outer core.  So even though they are bulkier than I would normally like they will work fine for what I need them for.  The black one is for my son because he is is always losing the covers to his ear buds so this will help with that plus it will protect his earbuds in his backpack.  I took the pink one because I needed something to protect my $100 Bose ear buds in my backpack for college so they aren't smashed and this will do the trick.  If you are looking for something that will fit in your pocket to protect your earbuds then this is not for you!"
920,5,"Okay. First off there is something people should know. There is a difference between the ACTUAL detox headphones and the knockoffs. The ones that are coming to people broken are the knockoffs. There is a huge difference in quality with the sound and the construction between the knockoffs and the actual Detox Pros. Yes the Detox headphones are essentially Dre Pros but black. DETOX IS A LIMITED VERSION. Only a set number of these were made and won't ever be made again hence the extra 100 dollar price tag.<br />Now to move on to the headphones themselves. These things are great, best sound quality of any other headphones on the market. The lock in system where the audio cable fits into the headphones can be switched to either side. The swivels on the ear cups make it easy for me to switch one ear up to listen to the speakers playing the music while the other side stays close to the head and still stays at clear high levels that I can hear over the crowd and stage speakers. The construction of the phones themselves are steel and aluminum making it a very hardy headphone. You actually have to try to break these things to mess them up. The stereo jack comes in 2.5mm with a slip over 3.5mm converter, these things are also gold plated, allowing for the best connection. People complain about the comfort level but the headphones due come tight, so obviously if you have a big head they might cause some discomfort. Fortunately for me my ears fit into the cups and I have had these things on for 4-6 hours both in and out of a DJ booth with zero discomfort. The cups come off so you can wash them. I paid 500 dollars for these in store, the original price being 600. Yes they are crazy expensive but think of it like a Eddie Van Halen Guitar, sure you can find cheaper guitars that do the same thing but its suppose to be something of a collectors item. If you can find someone selling their pair pick them up, but if you just want the same function without the extra price of the Detox logo go for the regular Dr. Dre Pros.<br />I will say everyone eyes these things so keep an eye on them."
921,3,"This is the second Skullcandy headphones i get. The first one last almost three years, what is a good time considering i used them continuously. This new pair looks very delicate and made without resilience in mind. The sound is good thou, and the mic does its job."
922,5,"I purchased this product so that I could run back-ups from my laptop. They worked great and I am happy that I purchased these. Buy from Amazon with confidence, as I do!"
923,3,Cool but meh. Very glad to have 3D on your home. But its a lot of pain to find game titles and active the whole system.
924,5,I bought this for my Grandson's bedroom so he could listen to music at night. It's sturdy and the sound is very good for the price.  I would certainly buy another if I were in the market for one!
925,5,I've only have for like 3 weeks but it has never haven me a problem since I bought it and compared to another hdmi I purchased in the past from Ross this one is much better quality :))
926,4,"for the price, exactly what i expected,ordered 12 pair received four pair, refund was swift and i cant complain too much, 4 stars for the shortage of plugs"
927,1,"I would not recommend this subwoofer to anyone! I purchased this sub to complement a VIZIO Sound Bar. After hooking it up and giving a listen, there seemed to be no sound coming from the subwoofer. Holding it in your hand you can feel some vibration, but you have to strain to tell it is producing sound. This product is \\""rated at 75 watts\\"", but it has an output that sounds lower than my 10 watts computer speakers. The Insignia Subwoofer has a \\""standby mode\\"" and if you put your television in mute, then the sub goes into standby mode and doesn't come back out until you get up and push a, very difficult to find, button on the back and wait for the blue light to go on. I couldn't even tell that it was not working for a half hour until I noticed the blue light wasn't on. It is that low. Save your money! Do not buy this!"
928,3,it does what i bought it to do so im quite satisfied with thus purchase not much else to be said about it.
929,4,"Just what is adcertised, they work perfecly with my iphone and the look is good too, nothing over the average but good enough"
930,5,"I have had bought tons of HDMI cords over the past for new Tv's i have gotten and for phones and i have to say  this is the best one i have had (some how my HDMI disappearing )  for the price and picture! love and the service department i give a A+, life time warranty for the under 20$ price awesome! i would definitively recommend this for someone who wants great quality video for the best price."
931,2,"Found the bass just too much, music sounded muffled. Also was uncomfortable after wearing for extended periods. Bought it from third party with restocking fee, so will keep them, but will continue searching."
932,5,"When my Bose Sound Dock stopped working, I took it as an opportunity to upgrade to a more portable alternative.  After many hours of google/YouTube research, I decided on a less expensive alternative then my amazing wife surprised me with the SoundLink II.  I am not a technophile with magic ears, but I do love music.  I must say I am completely satisfied with the rich full sound of this speaker.  I have no complaints, only praise to Bose.  If you are looking for a portable speaker, spend the extra cash and get the Bose SoundLink II."
933,5,Keep your Roku away from prying eyes and sticky fingers with this handy Roku Mounting Kit.  Fits like a glove and keeps your Roku safe and sound.
934,5,Exactly what my husband was looking for. Works great ! thanks for the quick mailing...we are happy with your service..thanks
935,5,Have only used for 1 run so far.  Ran 7 miles and these headphones never felt loose or at risk of falling out.  Much better than anything I've tried so far.  Sound quality is good as well.<br /><br />The headphones didn't fit me directly out of the box. I spent a few minutes of frustration trying to get them to fit as pictured on the box.  Once I changed sizes of the supplied accessories (eartips and ear clips) they fit great.  I would highly recommend spending some time to get the perfect fit.  The supplied case is an added bonus when on the go.<br /><br />I tried taking a call using the supplied speaker built into the volume control and the sound quality was horrible.  There was a bad echo and strange noises coming through the headphones.  Not sure if it was just a bad connection on my iPhone or a issue with the hardware.  This isn't a big deal to me since I rarely talk on the phone while working out.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend these to the runner who can't quite find a set of headphones that meet their needs.  These just might do it!  They worked for me.<br /><br />Amazon Prime shipping was fast as usual!
936,5,"These were OEM batteries at the best price that I found. Worked perfectly, better than aftermarket batteries.  Included the harness as well."
937,5,item is above expectations. found out it also works as a universal remote control for TV... only once it was delivered! awesome !
938,5,"I bought this for my school's auditorium, so we could hook-up a laptop computer to the projector and two LCD TV's.  I had to buy an HDMI splitter to go to the TV's, but it works great!  It certainly helps make our presentation look much more professional."
939,1,"I dislike these headphones so much, I am compelled to make a (very rare) product review.  I was using Apple iPhone earbuds.  They aren't great, and so I decided to try something new instead of constantly replacing them.  I tried these.  My requirements were that they have decent sound and a mic for phone calls.  Okay, so they have decent sound, but they don't stay in my ears (I'm constantly pressing the earbuds against my ears, and, yes, I tried all the different nubby things.), they have terrible phone call sound, and there is no external volume control on the headphone wires to adjust the volume without going back to the phone to do it.  I think I could have lived with everything else were they not so insanely uncomfortable to wear and keep in the ears.  So, no.  I don't recommend these.  I'll go review something I actually liked, now, so I'm not the chick who only leaves bad reviews."
940,3,"So first off let me say I had the beats by dre solo for months and i grew to hate them so i gave them to my brother and months after i ordered these. They came in a few days ago so here i am. The build is great it feels solid unlike the beats which are skinny and the earcups will come out of place with a enough force like say if your friend sits on part of it accidentally. These have a solid feel and a good weight and the cushion just feels amazingly soft. the cushion on the solos is falling off and it isn't as good. Also these have just as much of a bass kick as in the bass will tickle your ears just as much as the solos. These are excellent for hip-hop or metal which is what i use them for. The sound quality is better and the cord doesnt tangle and the ear cups don't create suction on your ears like the solos which is a great thing because the sound gets uneven and it sucks so overall i prefer these over the solos any day buy this and you won't regret it<br />UPDATE: 11/21/12 After a month of use i handled them too rough and snapped them, the build quality isn't as strong as the beats solo hd. I dont plan on using my warranty or fixing them just because i want something to bigger and more comfortable"
941,4,"I bought this tv for relatively cheap at $1200 shipped to the door including taxes, so my review takes that into account as well.<br /><br />1. The good: This TV has a lot to offer, like the LGs and Samsungs it also has the 2d to 3D button that will give some depth to 2D picture. The TV is light, and thin...plenty bright for a living room with lots of windows. Sound is awesome. It supports HDMI ARC which allows it to control certain home theater equipment automatically which is totally awesome. However you do need to buy a special HDMI 1.4b cable [[ASIN:B0019EHU8G Mediabridge Ultra Series - High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet 6 Feet Category 2 Certified - Supports 3D and Audio Return Channel]] <-- this one worked great for me, and it was cheap.  Sound wise the TV is great but i still paired it up with a small system.<br /><br />Mounting: the TV that I got did not include the base in the box, sony swore up and down to get it to me, but had a back order of 1-2 weeks. I chose to just get a wall mount and mount the TV. The OmniBasics wall mount i got that had a swivel arm, does not fit the TV perfectly because the TV's VESA mounts are made for rails to handle TILT stands, but its ok It fits with the arms showing a little bit on the bottom. But I thought Oh well it can swivel in and out and I am happy.<br /><br />The 3D glasses look awesome, they are almost stylish... and 5 minutes of charge is all it needs for a whole 3 hour movie.<br /><br />2. The bad: The Sony Entertainment Network or all the apps that make this TV fun is a very sluggish interface. I ended up just attaching my old ROKU XD which works a lot better.  It says Motionflow XR 480. but NO its not a 480hz tv, its only 240hz but still is better than most 120hz and with the price I got, I am happy.<br /><br />Additional 3D active shutter glasses are very expensive.  The Menu system is not easy like my Philips TVs or LG TVs. Sony makes great hardware but besides PS3 they don't have good software or GUI development folks.<br /><br />Tech support for Sony is off-shore, hence, not very good. While I don't mind someone in any part of the world helping me, I do take issue when I have to repeat my issues, name and phone number over 4 times to get the rep to understand me on top of when I am already frustrated with a missing part in the box (the stand or base of TV).<br /><br />3. The ugly: There really is isn't any so far.<br /><br />Other thoughts: The energy label says the TV uses $14 of electricity in the US for a whole year, which is awesome.<br /><br />UPDATE: 1-month later still no stand from Sony after being promised overnight shipping several times. I just ended up mounting tv on the wall. Tv is awesome for gaming on my PS3 as well. Blu-rays look awesome!"
942,1,"I asked a lot of the antennas, since we are a long way from the radio stations. However I thought they would at least improve reception, but  that did not happen."
943,5,Was everything my daughter wanted/expected. Plus it arrived 2days earlier than expected even using the free shipping! We are very satisfied customers! Slightly less expensive than the in store selection.
944,1,They shipped me a broken item and service was terrible. apparently it is my fault that it is broke because when opening the package i scratched the paint on it.
945,4,"I had another pair of NR10's for about 3 years of moderate use until the right cable broke from the earphone.  The noise isolation on these are great - on par or a tad better than Etymotic Hf2s.  However, they're much more comfortable in my ears.  The volume control is a nice touch when someone is trying to speak to me or I am listening to something else in my environment. I even ended up getting these after trying other much more expensive earphones/canal phones that offered headset capability because of the comfort and noise isolation.  The wire will wear out after a couple of years of moderate use, especially if you roll them up in your pocket as oppose to putting them in the case.  They work well on buses and airplanes when there are chatter bugs or cranky children aboard.  They're definitely great on the subway, and in subway stations where some lines screech to the point of poking holes in my eardrums.<br /><br />UPDATE: As expected, the cable broke off of the earphone after 1 year of use. Given the constant need to replace this item I gave up and found a more durable earphone."
946,5,"I purchased these via Amazon Prime (no shipping woot woot!) and am super happy.  They're great for blocking out noise.  Excellent, in my opinion (I have limited experience).  They have great bass response (for the price) and even vibrate enough to feel deep tones on the rubber touching your ear canal.  I appreciate this because often bass is felt best when it is 'felt' by the skin and not heard.  At the same time, the volume doesn't have to be too loud.<br /><br />There is a little bit of 'tin' in the sound, I'd say the volume peaks at around 50Hz and 6000 KHz.  However, this can also lend itself to increased fidelity when on the move.  As long as you're not mixing sound with these, they'll be excellent... for the price."
947,5,"I needed speakers for my son's computer. Long term goal is to get excellent Amplified speakers, like the Emotiva Pro. Temporary solution is that I had a pair of excellent Paradigm LCR-450 Speakers in the closet. Paradigms will eventually go into a second system in the den using this amp and decent CD player.<br /><br /> I got the amp in and hooked it up to the computers earphone output jack. This is not the best option as the USB output into a D/A converter would be much better. This is, as I said, a temporary fix until I can get amplified speakers for the computer. This amp is much better than the much more expensive Marantz SR-880 MK II that I had the Paradigms hooked up to. That Marantz could not drive the paradigms at decent levels without overheating. Even coming out of the computer headphone jack the sonics are much more palpable, rhythmic, with great bass and excellent treble. No listening fatigue after two hours of listening, and the amp stayed nice and cool, never showing any strain. I am thrilled with this purchase! All things considered, this was the least expensive option to get my son some great sound, put perfectly good, and expensive, speakers back in service, and not waste money while keeping the goal of building my second Den system. I am glad I did some research and discovered Emotiva prior to making any purchases. Their customer service is second to none, and you get to talk to real, knowledgeable people who are honest, and who try to save you money by giving intelligent feedback and suggestions. Warranty is excellent too! I suspect I will be getting several more Emotiva products."
948,5,"I had looked around for a solution for our vacation and being able to share the audio from our tablet for movies or music while on the airplane. The main feature that I wanted was independent volume control between myself and my wife as I have a tendency to listen to music louder than she does. I had read reviews of others not having good range when adjusting the volume, not the case with this one. The range is very good and is linear in its control and works as I had hoped. It made our flight much more enjoyable. The only think I would like to see is it be about 25% smaller, but I will always accepts performance over sacrificing performance with a smaller footprint.<br /><br />Overall, if you are looking for a really good splitter that works the way it should--- this one is it. We also used it with an iPod nano and it also performed great, so no problems with lowered powered items."
949,5,"How beautiful, and most of all well- working head phones, very attractive. I love the color, but most of all it works well"
950,5,I love the price&the charger makes it were I never have to be without my phone fully charged!!!  Very convient.
951,1,Sony has had a good reputation for their products. This radio does not fit that bill.  The sound is tinney and cheap. The reception on local strong stations is poor. I would have given this product zero stars if that were an option. Don't waste your money on this.
952,4,"We ended up getting 14 channels, 3 or 4 didn't show up, a few in spanish. Mostly local channels, But we got ABC in HD!!!! I think its worth it just for that. I don't know that I would pay full price, but I bought it for the sale price of about $30. A couple times where it cuts out, but only a couple seconds at a time.<br /><br />I live in an apartment so that may cut out some of the channels. We moved it a few times to see where it would pick up the most channels."
953,5,"I am very happy with this speaker, I received one as a gift and turned around and gave one as a gift!  Sound is clear and loud, and easy to set up, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a little oooomph from IPad, IPhone!"
954,5,Good price and it arrived early. Fit right in to the TV and the system has not missed a beat since then.
955,5,I love this remote. It works very well with my HTPC. I have had this remote for a year and I cant believe I forgot to write a review. I highly recommend to anybody looking for a media remote.
956,5,"This Antenna seems to work perfectly now that I have moved back to LA area, and does so well that I ordered two more for my friends since they all wonder how I got so many channels without cable! 84! But too many Spanish and Korean so I ended up with about 38 after getting rid of the religious and etc.<br /><br />I had Dishnetwork and the programming is much better on the networks and whatever else I want I can goto Hulu and watch from there onto my 3D LG that I also got from Amazon.<br /><br />Well 3 people can't be wrong, but the number of channels does differ and I always got the versions without the telescopic ears! I am not sure if that helps as much as turning the whole antenna."
957,1,"The Woodees are great to look at and give that great sound they claim to provide but... The wiring on the set I purchased causes the sound to go in and out so frequently that it renders them useless. There must be design mods made to use stronger junction points and a more quality type wire must be used. My Woodees broke not two weeks into having them.<br /><br />The Sport clips are great, a little cheap but it's just a clip on so it allows you to \\""go sport\\"" when needed and \\""non-sport\\"" when needed.<br /><br />Overall since the product doesn't work I would not reccommend you purchase them."
958,5,"Upgrade from the other version they also sell here on Amazon with the change out heads.  This one is far better because you maintain the plug face while having two dedicated USB ports.  And yes, you can run all three simultaneously (plug, and both USB ports).  I cant really imagine a better design.  You can ditch all your supplemental USB to wall plug adapters (iWhatever) and you dont need to carry different heads like the previous model I had (http://www.amazon.com/Kensington-Travel-Adapter-Charger-33346/dp/B000BTL0OU/ref=pd_sbs_a_11).  I am confused by the reviews that claim its bulky or it doesnt work.  This is maybe 10% larger that the model I linked above and you dont need any additional heads so net/net its smaller.  Plus you must consider cumulative space i.e. other adapters you can ditch by having dedicated USB ports.  And as far as not working - its NOT A POWER CONVERTER nor does it claim to be.  It works as labeled, period."
959,4,"My Xbox 360 was pretty dusty so I bought this and used it on it.<br />My Xbox would mess up and freeze but I don't know, after using this<br />the longevity seemed to increase. It ran smoother and nicer.<br />So I'll have to say that this done it's job."
960,5,Works flawlessly. No difference in video quality to a DVI-DVI or HDMI-HDMI connection on a 1080p monitor. No recognition problems from a PC or a cable box.
961,4,"I purchased this because my laptop has only a VGA output port, and neither my TV (Samsung 6070) or HT receiver (Yamaha RX-V673) support VGA connections.  It seems to work as expected, but curiously I can only get 1080P resolution to work when the converter is directly connected to one of the TV's HDMI inputs. If I connect it to the HT receiver's HDMI inputs, lower resolutions are displayed, but 1080P does not work for some reason. The receiver supports other 1080P sources (such as my Blu-Ray player), so it's a bit curious why 1080P from this converter doesn't seem to work through the receiver."
962,5,"I have hooked these with Klipsch RB-35 (sensitivity  96dB) for desktop listening. It has just enough power to fill a small room. USB input is good as Creative XMod connected to RCA input. Build quality is good, no hum or noise."
963,4,"This has been a good little surge protector that has worked great. I could not however use it in my first intended application. I originally purchased this to use with my TV I mounted on the wall, but this surge protector protrudes quite a bit, at least a coule of incehes, then when you plug the cable in, its even worse. So that was a no go. I would up using it for the TV downstairs and it has worked out that way. If you get it it will serve you well and protect your TV as it should, just keep in mind that it is quite a bit thincker than the picture would leave you to believe."
964,3,"PRO:The device itself is nicely priced for its specs. Larger than average screen, decent memory, and I have had no issues stocking it with books from a third party vendor or my own private collection.  Interface is clumsy, but tolerable.  Battery life gives me at least a week of heavy use.<br /><br />CON: Sony's \\""READER\\"" software is an astonishingly clumsy, slow and bug-ridden work of crap.  Avoid letting it \\""Sync\\"" to your device as this takes a ridiculous amount of time and often reinstalls (multiple copies) books already present.  The website associated with the program is just as clumsy and poorly thought through.<br /><br />Sum: I'm liking the reader but surely resent Sony's typically lazy and inept approach to the software."
965,5,"We purchased this mount to use with a 20 inch tv in our kitchen. It was delivered within 5 days or so. It took about 20 minutes to install and works perfectly for our size tv. It seems well made and serves its purpose well. The swivel is very functional for turning the tv any direction I want while I'm cooking or pushing it back against the wall. If you are looking for an inexpensive but good wall mount, you won't be disappointed with this one."
966,5,This was a great product for those of us who  want to hook an iPad to the TV. It came very quickly and functioned exactly as advertised. Good Company.
967,5,"Just got 2 galaxys for my kids ages 8 and 7.  We went to the apple store and looked at an Ipod touch before we ordered, and am I glad we did.  The galaxy blows the touch out of the water.  More capabilities, same apps, and the screen on the 5.0 is way larger and clearer than the touch.<br />I will admit I was nervous because Apple is \\""supposed\\"" to be the best, but I think these are way better."
968,2,"I bought these headphones based on the reputation I've heard regarding Klipsch. Firstly, let me say that their sound is terrific. Lots of bass (lows) but the mids and highs are still very crisp and noticeable. I can honestly say that the best quality music I've ever heard was with these headphones. They block out ambient and background noise quite well, despite not being proper noise cancelling headphones. However, they can become quite uncomfortable after a few hours, but it's probably not recommended to use them for a few hours anyways. By far the most annoying thing about these headphones is the wires connecting the ear pieces to the remote. Regardless of how careful and cautious you are, they will twist and cannot be untwisted (since they are connected at both ends). I returned one pair (the remote was faulty) and got another pair of the same headphones and both suffered from the wires twisting. You may think that this is a minor inconvenience, but when they twist up to your chin and bother your face, it is more than a slight inconvenience. Furthermore, they twist so much that it can actually affect the integrity of the wires themselves. The only solution I have been able to find is wrapping the wires with electrical tape to make them stiffer. I am seriously disappointed and expected better, given their price. I will never allow myself to buy headphones again unless the headphones have only one wire (similar to the Klipsch Mode M40s)."
969,4,"I ordered these ear buds last year when I decided to take up the sport of jogging.  I decided on these ear buds based on the other positive reviews especially when it came to sports.  I loved the ear buds and there are the only ear buds that actually stay in while running and I like that it comes with various ear bud sizes.  Unfortunately, they didn't last that long and the right side stopped working.  I contacted the manufacturer and they were amazing in offering assistance to replace the ear buds with their warranty.  I hope these ear buds last longer than the first pair.  Either way, it's a great product at a fair price.  I would certainly recommend these for anyone looking to listen to music while running!!"
970,5,"For me headphones have always been a necessary evil. They never fit comfortably and the sound volume is never quite right, but if you want to listen to something when you're out in public it's the only option. I had simply resigned myself to this reality and decided to accept the status quo. That is until the discovery of the Philips SHO2205BK/28 O'Neill the tread in-ear headset - black. Now, at last things have changed.<br /><br />The headsets ear sleeves fits my ears comfortably and comes with three different sized cushions to choose from. The sound comes through beautifully and with the convenient volume adjustment function on the cord its easy to maintain the level that works best for you. Comfort and fit were my two greatest concerns when considering what headset to get. This set gave me what I was looking for. What else could anyone want? Well..., how about a rather elegant looking black and gold no tangle cord that is also constructed to be both pleasing to the eye yet durable enough to withstand the wear and tear that is certain to come  its way? Look no further."
971,5,"I just received this headset and it looks great and seems to be high quality, my issue is that it is ONLY for the iPod, iPad, iPhone, which is not what I needed.  Before I bought it I did some research to see if it would only work on these products and could not find a definitive answer.  I thought/hoped it would work as both a headset for the iPhone AND for PC gaming.  Hoping it had additional features for use with the Apple products.  The reality is, that while it probably works great for the Apple products, it will not work for PC gaming since it only has 1 plug for everything while a PC headset needs one plug for the Mic and one for the headphones.<br />I can not rate the sound quality or anything about the product since I never even plugged it in.  I made this review to hopefully help others to not fall in to the same predicament I did.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Instead of returning these, I purchased the [[ASIN:B0058DOWH6 StarTech MUYHSFMM 3.5mm 4 Pin to 2x3 Pin 3.5mm Headset Splitter Adapter - F/M]] and now this works great for PC gaming and VoIP.  Only issue now is the cord is a tad short but I can make due with that."
972,5,"This is one of the very few JBL powered subwoofers that come in \\""sealed\\"" enclosures.  Sealed enclosures enhance the accuracy of the sound reproduction and improve the response time.  The SUB 550P, being a 10\\"" speaker, is a good compromise between punch and boom.<br /><br />This sub lives up to the JBL name.  It sounds loud, clear, and heavy.  I held my open palm in front of the grille, and even at the lowest volume, the punches \\""felt\\"" very heavy and forceful. Definitely an awesome sub."
973,5,"I bought this radio as a refurbished item through Amazon, but shipped from Grace. By buying it that way I saved about 30% off of the list price.  When the radio arrived it was in new condition with all of the accessories, cords and manual.  It is easy to set up and the instructions are clear.  I am now listening to Pandora wired through my whole house audio system and enjoying it immensely."
974,5,These Dvd's work great! I have had no trouble at all with any of the disc and they were a great price also. Expedient delivery too!
975,1,I took a chance on the 3 good reviews on this product and I literally got burned. The adapter should have been a direct replacement for my Toshiba laptop all voltage and wattage matched up. The adapter hooked up to my laptop with zero issues. After 10mins I went to pick the adapter up to move it and it was literally hot enough to burn my hand. I ended up using a oven mitt to move the adapter to the stove to cool off. I also noticed my Laptop was running extremely hot which leads me to wonder if the adapter was even supplying the stated voltages. This is a prime example of you get what you pay for. I ended up returning this adapter and getting a Toshiba OEM adapter and have had zero issues with it.
976,5,"Fantastic headset. All the controls work as expected. Fair amount of bass for a rather small set. I purchased the refurbished model and except for the packaging being clearly not new, everything is perfect condition. Great purchase."
977,4,"Well all I can say is that it works, and it works fine, the video is good and the good thing is that you can also set up the audio with this cable so it's recommended, and also because of the price, it's much less expensive than the original from apple."
978,3,"#1-If you're looking for safety in grounding, you will not find it here. #2 This product doesn't disclose the current rating, that is the amount of load this product will safely handle. The current/load rating stated on the package is 6A at 120V, or 13A at 250V. However, the item itself is stamped for 10A at 250V, which isn't a lot.  #3 This product is not UL listed. I would also be willing to bet the same is true for the other similar products you'll find here.<br /><br />I purchased this for battery and laptop charging, which are low current loads and sufficient for what I needed. If you are one who chooses not to read and look for electrical ratings of the items you buy, it is always possible to end up with a chance to pull out the marshmallows.<br /><br />As always, make sure the item that you are attaching is rated for both 120-240V and 50-60Hz if you want it to last any length of time.<br /><br />It's made decently enough and no problems with shipping."
979,5,Purchased 11/2011 and all 50 discs recorded without fail utilizing at least 6.5 gigs of space on each. What more can I say?
980,1,Bought these to use with my Ultimate Ears 10vi. I don't understand how anyone could use these. They just would not stay in my ear. Going back to the Comply tips.
981,2,"I bought a pair of these before getting on a jetblue flight and ended up wishing I had rented a headset from the airline instead.  I could not get the buds to stay in my ears regardless of the size of the silicone tip.  The mic works ok and the sound quality is average, but both functions are moot based on the difficulty getting them to stay on."
982,2,"when I got this Radio, I was really hoping it would synch with my new iPhone 4s, but when I plunged it in, it would not sync. so buyer beware, this will not work on your iPhone 4 or 4s. only the earlier models"
983,5,"The cable that I received is in fact HDMI, but it is not the one in the photo, and not the same brand.<br />It is the generic black plastic HDMI cable. Not the Aurum Ultra Series. Not worth the time and headache to ship back. Will test the cable out tonight, and make sure it actually works. Seems like decent quality - just not as flexible as I had hoped - since I was going to use this cable on my 8' Jib arm w/ my DSLR camcorder. Either way, still not bad price.<br /><br />UPDATE: Was contacted by the seller.<br /><br />Hello,<br /><br />I apologize for this mistake. I will send you out the woven blue cable free of charge.<br /><br />Again, I apologize for the inconvenience.<br /><br />[ Name Removed ]<br /><br />Will post update of the product when it is received.<br /><br />UPDATE: Got the new cable via UPS 3DAY SELECT - It is the correct one. This is a quality cable. Perfect Price, and I was not even expecting the vendor to send it to me. Buy it!"
984,4,"I honestly love this iPod, and I haven't found anything wrong with it yet, except for two things: 1) It doesn't hold much music, and 2) It takes a lot longer to switch songs.<br />If you listen to a lot of music, I suggest not getting the 8GB, and getting the 16GB instead. The 8GB only holds about 1000 songs, and if you're like me, then this just isn't enough.<br />As for the long time to switch songs, this only happens when you're on your list of all songs. Normally it would take about a second to click a song, but on this one, it takes three or four seconds.<br />Other than those two complaints, I absolutely love this iPod. The slimness comes in handy when your pockets are extremely small, and the radio definitely comes in handy. I love the bigger screen, and the camera is pretty decent too."
985,1,"This product simply doesn't work! I bought 3 of it, unfortunately none of them fitted to any of my appliances or plugs! The worst thing is that they called me and asked me to remove my review and they will return my money, so I removed the review, but they didn't give me my money back! Trust me. This product is useless. Don't waste your money on it."
986,5,"I bought this radio for my boyfriend because he has an iPOD.  However, he has talked about getting an iPAD and I also knew my phone was on its last leg so I would eventually get an iphone.  So this model was also chosen for its versatility.  The only complaint would be that the alarm isn't loud enough for me (I need a bullhorn)."
987,5,LOVE this digital audio optical cable - I won't use anything but these cables. Great performance for a decent price. No hassle packaging meant I had them up and working in no time flat. Wonderful!
988,3,"I ordered this for my Samsung 40\\"" LCD TV. If you choose to mount your 40\\"" TV on this with the central arm component centered on the wall piece, then you will end up with the wall component sticking out 3\\"" from the edge of the TV if you place the TV flush against the wall or with your mount's arm fully folded. So I had to mount it slightly off from the center position, towards one edge. Overall, I am happy with this product but minor hiccups with this product is preventing me from giving it a full 5 *.<br /><br />The good points...<br /><br />1. Very light weight.<br />2. Easy to assemble.<br />3. Very sturdy.<br />4. Easy to follow instructions.<br /><br />The bad ones...<br /><br />1. Quality of some components is terrible. While mounting the wall plate, one of the screw just broke while tightening !!! Lucky, I had a spare screw around.<br />2. Even though I mounted the back plate level, when the product was fully installed I noticed that the arm is slightly crooked causing the TV to list slightly to the right. I had to fiddle with the tilting mechanism to make it look right. But I am afraid the problem will come back once you change the angle or move the arm."
989,1,"Waste of money. At least for Direct TV equipped systems. Perhaps for someone who only watches ten channels, but \\""walking\\"" through 50 is tedious."
990,4,Always used a basic cheap antenna for awhile now. Finally got sick of the bad signal and decide to invest in a better option. Checked reviews for this antenna and decided to try it out. So far I've received a lot more channels and way better signal. i would recommend this to anyone that doesn't care for cable but want a good quality viewing.
991,4,"I bought this unit for my daughter.  She has an iPod Touch 3rd Generation and likes to listen to music on it while doing homework or playing on her computer.  The sound from the iPod speakers is weak at best.  And she doesn't like to wear earphones all the time.  So enter the speaker dock.<br /><br />For the price, this Sylvania unit is excellent.  It's easy to set up; takes only about 3 minutes.  Unbox it, position near a power source, plug in the power adapter and dock your iPod.  The sound is not Bose quality (what'd you expect for less than $25), but is fine for background music.  It's clear and free of distortion at volumes up to about 3/4 of max.  The unit itself seems well made with quality plastics and good overall design.  The cradle portion securely locks the iPod in place, but doesn't take a whole lot of effort to undock.<br /><br />My only negative is the fact that you can't use the iPod screen when docked.  When you plug it into the dock, the iPod goes into music play mode automatically and a message tells you no other functions are available.  So you can't select songs via the iPod; you have to use the skip buttons on the unit.  Not a big deal, but a bit of an inconvienence.<br /><br />My daughter is happy with the unit.  It's a fine accessory at an excellent price."
992,1,When they work the headsets sounds really well however as most of the chinese build products are very low quality. First pair had to be returned and replaced during warranty after 5 months while second is broken again after another 7 months with minimum use. The problem it is not under warranty and now I need to find another pair of ear buds. I would give 0 rating but don't have the option for a $80 headset lasting less then half a year
993,5,"I don't usually write reviews, but I have to make an exception for this antenna, it works!<br />I tried tons of antennas before but none of them work, I can't get some of the major channels (ABC, Fox)<br />But when I scan for channels for the first time with this antenna, I got all major channels and more than 30 additional ones. (I think i got all of them)<br />I am living in an apartment in Downtown Los Angeles, all I have to do is to put the antenna near the window. That's it!<br />I totally recommend this to everyone !"
994,5,"I use this adapter to connect a Lenovo T420 laptop to an LG monitor. The laptop only has VGA and Display Port outputs and the LG monitor only accepts VGA or DVI inputs. I used the analog VGA route for a while, but the display was fuzzy especially for text. The display is noticeably clearer when using this digital adapter."
995,4,I have the MacBook Pro Mid 2010. With i5 2.53GHz<br /><br />I used a different cable before. HDMI to DVI then used DVI to Display port. It was working fine.<br />I just wanted one cable to have less clutter. I can't seem to get the clamshell mode to work though. There seems to be problems.<br /><br />I'm not sure why. It's quite upsetting cause my old cable seemed to have that feature working no problem.<br /><br />If anyone has a solution. please tell me I'd appreciate it a lot!<br /><br />Also there is sounds coming out if anyone was wondering! :)
996,1,"When i saw the price I thought it would be a great deal. It came in the time frame they said. But after charging for a full 24 hours, it plays for only 5 seconds then cuts itself off. I will be returning it."
997,5,I just got this cable and it was easy to hook up. The picture looks great! I'm happy I bought it.
998,1,"I've owned several dock/alarm systems but this is the only one I've returned.  The box sounds good and does the job of connecting through the iPhone 4, but thats the best I can say.  It was much bulkier than I perceived and seemed cheap from the get go.  The display is OK, but I've seen better from WalMart products.  My biggest gripe is that the buzzer and radio/iphone features cannot be set to different volumes.  So in order to have one at a reasonable level the other is either too low or incredibly loud.  Honestly I bought this product because it advertised the features I wanted and was a great price, but not worth it at all. Eventually I decided to spend a few extra dollars and get something I was confident about and the Sangean RCR-10 is what I love."
999,5,I ordered for this Mediabridge Ultra Series - High Speed HDMI Cable and am extremely happy with it.  The video quality is awesome and its so convenient ordering it from Amazon.
1000,4,I wanted short colored cords so I can easily see which devices are connected to which ports.  This works for me.
1001,5,I wanted something to organize my dvds and blu ray disks. I read reviews for several cases and ended up with this one. The one suggestion in the reviews was to hang onto the cardboard piece that goes along the zippered side to make it easier to zip. I held onto that piece and have had no problem with it. Seems sturdy
1002,1,"Bought it new at Best Buy, brought it home, spent an hour accessing hard-to-get-at-behind-the-workstation outlets, reconfiguring all my home-office plugs, etc - plugged it in - nada! - didn't work, didn't power up, didn't do nuttin'; plugged it into another outlet just to confirm I didn't trip something, still no-worky. Pretty disconcerting for a UPS/surge protector product that's supposed to protect your computer. It's going back tomorrow -"
1003,5,"Cables are very sturdy and appear to be well built. These are quality cables , not the thin cheap stuff sold all over the place. Price was also reasonable.  Recommend to anyone looking for a better connection"
1004,5,"Love the radio presets, and the sound is really good too! It's small enough to put in the shoulder pocket of running clothes, unlike an iPod."
1005,5,"Glad I read reviews, almost purchased one that buyers complained of streaking.  Very happy with it's performance and will most likely purchase again in the future."
1006,4,Stocking stuffer for my daughter. She jogs and loves it. Does not have to reinsert into her ears while running.
1007,2,"Pro:<br /> ..Great Bose sound.<br /><br />Con:<br />..Can only select playlists, not individual albums.<br />..iPod/iPhone display never changes when a song, album, or playlist changes.<br />..Dead-reckoning required when using remote.  You better have playlists and order memorized and not lose track of where you are when you press the remote buttons.<br /><br />This would be a great player, if only, the iPod (nano 5)/iPhone(3G)screen were updated when things change and if you could navigate between albums.<br /><br />For me, not only is the remote useless, but the display never shows what is playing.  And this product claims Apple certification!<br /><br />------<br /><br />Wanted to do some comparative listening to some clips on my PC, so I connected the best pair of speakers I own (this Bose) using the Audio In connection on its back.<br /><br />Darn thing turns automatically itself off after 10 minutes with no input!!!<br /><br />Every time I was ready to play my next sample, I had to push a volume button, which upset the comparison.  Frustrating!!! Surely \\""low power mode\\"" (aka \\""off\\"") on this expensive box could monitor the \\""Audio In\\"" line..."
1008,5,"These are nice for the price. Very low profile. Easy to install. For the best sound, stuff some insulation into the wall before hand. This keeps the sound from escaping between the studs. The speakers got richer instantly after stuffing the holes. For the price I don't think I could have better."
1009,1,"somehow i thought this was a case.. when i got this its a dang sticker.. im using it but i wouldnt buy this again, i do not see the point of it..."
1010,5,These headphones offer the rich bass sound advertised! I use them to work out and the great sound gets me goin!!  Price is outstanding for the product! Would reccomend to everyone.
1011,5,"High quality cable!<br /><br />Bought it to use in-wall between two panels. This cable works well with good shielding, is very flexible (better than the coaxial cable I was thinking of using) easily fitting through some pretty tight turns, and has well made connectors that won't slip off and seem pretty sturdy. I purchased this for the length, the fact that I don't want to put anything in the wall I will have to replace soon and the reasonable price."
1012,5,Loved these..was spending so much money on earphones and they would break often..and the constant tangling of earphone cord was driving me crazy..I found them for 2.99 at local container store..6$ is too much to pay for these.
1013,5,"Let's get to the primary part: Shipping.  I got this Refurbished and it took a week and a half (or so I remember) to ship. This is great and I had no troubles whatsoever. It didn't come with the original packaging, but seeing how the packaging is nothing really special, I don't really care. It came with the USB cord and the headphones both it it's original state. The USB works with no trouble but I'm very protective over this USB because I do not want to buy another preparatory one.  The Item Itself:   So an hour out of the box and it's Roxbox'd. Sorry not to base the review on the stock firmware but the basic firmware just sucks. The UI is bubbly and looks cheap, similar to the UI you'll see on a knockoff iPod. However, when I Rockbox'd it, the UI looks awesome and it FULL of features.  The build quality is great, it doesn't feel cheap in your hands but if you have extreme palm sweat like I do, your sweat will spear on the rubber back, but it's ok because you can rub it off with a dry finger. Now the screen is a big deal. Every time something minor hits the screen (like I put it in my pocket with some coins in it) the screen get's a little scratch. This sounds like a gripe but after using it for a month and a half the screen has accumulated many scratches and when I look at it in certain light, the scratches show off. Nasty. However, if you keep the back light at about 6 (out of 12) the scratches won't be scene when it's on. I haven't used a toothpaste-scratch remover technique yet but I might pretty soon.  I think that's about all I can say about this great device. I like it and it does everything and more. Sure, I Rockbox'd it because of the horrendous UI, but you really have to. All in all, 5/5."
1014,5,"I was skeptical of the other review for this amazing cable, given the fact that it is a PVC jacket that is used to shield the magnoradiospectral interference. Lo and behold, I was able to teleport quite successfully using this cable. Oh, and I can watch HiDef also. So that's a bonus."
1015,5,"You could probably get all of the components and build something very similar to this for a little less money, but this certainly gives a more polished look and is very easy to install.  But this is the best way to get conditioned power to a wall mounted device without cables hanging all over the place.  I was installing this for a projector.  I wanted to be able to use a UPS battery backup for the projector in case the power went out when the projector was on -- bulbs are expensive enough that I want to be sure I can properly shut the projector down to cool the bulb properly.  My install required cutting a hole 1/2 way up the wall because of a fire break in between the studs, so there was a little bit of drywall texturing and painting.  If you don't have that, this would literally take 30 minutes or less to install if you have any kind of handyman skills.  There is almost no danger at all because you are never tapping into the live circuits already in your walls.  The 6' of included Romex cable wasn't quite enough for me either because I had to pull all the way up the wall, almost to the ceiling. I had about 10' of 12 gauge Romex left over from previous projects so that wasn't a problem.    The end result is a very clean looking plate that is very easy to manage cables through.  If you have a wall mounted TV or projector, I would highly recommend this."
1016,5,"I purchase this receiver for my bedroom, the quality of the sound is very good, and it is powerful even it had 50 watt. I have speakers JBL CS6100 and Blu ray Sony BDP S-470. The experience with the blu Ray movie \\""Legend\\"" was amazing, it sounds really clear and deep.  Its a great receiver."
1017,2,"These headphones do provide great sound. Very thick bass, and great noise cancelling. However, my first pair had very poor connection at the phone plug, and the left speaker would crack on and off (mostly off). Returned and got a brand new one, same exact problem.  These are cheaply made, and won't last long. Heck, mine were broken right out of the box... So unless you are satisfied with music only in one half of your head, I would look elsewhere."
1018,5,"after jacking around with the energizer/duracel chargers, i decided to finally take the plunge and get a real charger. This charger has been great and has added life to almost all of my rechargables that energizer said was bad. I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a simple charger to take the headache out of charging your rechargables."
1019,4,"The sound is amazing!  I do agree with other reviewers, that it would be nice to have the same sound plugged in, but I really appreciate the extra battery play time.  Now on to the bad;  This is a portable device that comes with a case, why isn't there onboard remote control storage?  It would be nice to have a retractable charging cable as well.  My biggest gripe though is for my iPhone to connect, I must take it out of its case.  This was almost a deal breaker for me.  Logitech please extend the dock connector so that I don't have to take my iPhone out of the case every time I want to use it.  All of my other radios work with the case on.  Overall, very pleased with my purchase."
1020,1,"Very low quality, the sound cuts in and out if my iPhone or iPod moves the slightest bit.  It's not worth my time to return it; spend a couple bucks more and get a quality cable."
1021,3,"This is a nice clock/speaker system.  I put my iphone 4 on it and it sounds good.  However, when the music is not playing, the radio interferrence \\""buzz\\"" is constant.  I had to take it away from the nightstand the next morning.  It was disturbing my sleep.  If you are using iphones with it, DON'T !"
1022,1,"Stay away from this company at all cost.  They have the worst customer service I have ever dealt with.  They do not respond to emails, emails posted on their website nor phone calls.  I left numerous message on their website, multiple message (when their voice mailbox was not full) and emails directly to them with no response.<br /><br />Again, they are most pathetic company I know of.<br /><br />Buy other products as you will find NO CUSTOMER SERVICE here based on my experience.<br /><br />They really are this bad."
1023,5,"I love this iTouch.  I had the first generation iTouch, but this one has so many other features.  The camera is really a very convenient app.  It was also so easy to sync up.  I just plugged it into my computer and it synced everything from my old iPods into it, so it was ready to go at the outset."
1024,5,I've had  the high end referrence system for approx 6 years I've never heard anything better. The 15's are as good as my wife and my daughter can handle from a Db perspective. I just purchased new B&W CM9' Towers plus the high end Center but the two subs will be both from Klipsch. This will be my high end only room.
1025,5,Product works great and the price beat anything I could find locally. Some of the cables were as much a 3 to 5 times this cables price.
1026,1,"Wow, I can't believe I just blew $100 on this mount. I figured, \\""Lets get the mount installed and then put the TV up..\\"" Mount installed, TV.. wait, the bracket doesn't line up. Probably because this new LG slim mount TV isn't compatible with the LG slim mount TV I just bought. AWESOME! WAY TO GO LG!  Horrible product description, no detail saying it doesn't fit most models..."
1027,5,"Right away, let me tell you that I am a Bose fanatic! I am a Bose Earphone user (a $129.00 a pop) which I use it daily with my Cellphone. They work great because they are no noise cancelling. However, Sennheiser CX 215 Earphones, that's a different story! I am going to skip the technical blah, blah, blah and tell you my thoughts about it. If you want a comfortable noise cancelling earphones with an outstanding sound at a decent price this is your choice.  The only complaints that I have are:  1.The cord is way too short, 3 feet!  2.Because of the size they are a little problematic to handle (Hey, I am a big guy!)  Aside from these two issues, go ahead get a pair disconnect yourself from the world and enjoy your beat!"
1028,5,"I love the remote.  It was extremely easy for me to set it up with my Panasonic Plasma TV, DirecTV receiver, Sony Soundbar, and Sony PS3 (I also bought the PS3 adapter which works great).  At first I ran into some problems b/c after pushing the \\""Watch TV\\"" button I didn't keep it pointed long enough and not everything was turned on.  That's my only advice, give it a couple seconds before setting the remote back down.  When something doesn't work right, the help button always fixes it easily.  Just follow the straight forward directions on the screen.  Great remote.  Bought one for my father-in-law and plan to buy one for another family member for Christmas."
1029,5,"If you know what this item is, you know it's not rocket science to hook up and use it.  It has one purpose only and for that purpose this little unit is the low price solution.  It's hared to review or rate because with RF modulators only two things are important.  1) do they work, and 2), is it affordable.  This modulator works and is very affordable!"
1030,5,The adapter is of very high quality. It is a bit large and if you plan to use 2 of them next to each other it may be a bit tight on space.
1031,5,"I routinely call my mom after work to gripe about...work. After we hang up, I typically have to then grab my headphones to listen to music. With this headset, I don't need to switch anything. Music sounds great through this headset! It's also safe as walking around with big headphones makes you a target in some cases.<br /><br />As far as calls go, it's perfect. I tested it in Times Square, then on windy corners near the Hudson River. My mom heard me clearly, and vice versa. I've finally found the right one!"
1032,5,"This is my second remote from Harmony with the first one being a 628.  They are similar by the way you program the remote.  Actually, all I had to do was connect the Harmony One and my profile from the 628 installed on the new remote without any changes needed.  There are physical buttons for just about all of my electronics and soft buttons for anything else I want to add.  I love the fact that it comes with a charger although I'm having to recharge it more often than I would usually replace disposable batteries but that's just nitpicking.  I'm very satisfied by the Harmony One and I recommended it to anyone looking to consolidate or replace their remotes."
1033,5,"I bought this about a couple of years ago and have been very happy with it.  Very easy to use.  The battery life is more than adequate for me.  I use the FM radio nearly as much as the music player.  About the only thing I didn't like was scratching the screen within a few days of getting it, but it has held up fairly well since."
1034,5,Speakers sound great with this wire. Wired eight speaker in a home sound system with two run over 75 feet which sound just as good as the 15 foot runs.
1035,1,"Says it has \\""bookmarks\\"" but all it does is remember what track to return to . NOT where in the file it was. useless for audio books"
1036,5,"It is durable and easy to use.  It is also just the right link for what I need it for, not too long for an adapter."
1037,4,"I really enjoy the sound quality and depth of full-size headphones, but walk and bike nearly everywhere, so the larger ear cup style headphones don't really suit my lifestyle. These, however, are just about a perfect compromise between the sound quality of full size headphones and the portability of ear buds.<br /><br />The sound quality is excellent, and the non-noise canceling design means I can still hear traffic around me. The bass response is very full and rich, and the sound has a nice spacial quality to it, more like I expect on higher-end larger headphone sets.<br /><br />I can still wear my bike helmet comfortably with these, and have never had them fall off. The ear hooks sometimes are at first a little uncomfortable/awkward with my glasses, but the band seems to naturally settle into place after a minute or less.<br /><br />My only gripe is that the plug tends to fail somewhat quickly if you keep your MP3 player in a pants pocket. I recommend keeping it in a jacket pocket or elsewhere where no strain is put on the plug.<br /><br />Overall, one of the better headphones I've ever owned."
1038,5,"I found this item was excellent.  I plan to purchase further products made by mediabridge both audio, video, hdmi, cables made with the same excellent quality.  Ron"
1039,5,the naxa 246 is good radio with usb input and easy to use for anyone for home or office I like and like the price good all around and free shipping with prime!
1040,1,They have yet to respond to repeated attempts of mine. My  SB2's will not pair with my Droid Bionic. It worked fine with OG Droid however.
1041,5,"Broadcast TV in Fresno CA comes generally from two groups of transmitters, both groups about 30 miles away but separated by about 50 degrees.  They include a number of low power stations, a high-band UHF station (7.2) that carries some San Francisco Giants baseball games, and one network station about 50 miles away.  Terrain is pretty much flat so the broadcast points are line-of-sight, but our neighborhood has lots of tall trees in the way.  I installed the HD7694P on the roof a few days ago, pointed it generally between the two transmitter groups, and was delighted to find solid strong signal from all stations.  A scan brought in 55 stations, and after weeding out the ones I wasn't interested in we're still left with a good 20 or more usable stations.  It's a great success in my book with much better off-axis performance than I had any right to expect, even through the trees.  Nice job, Winegard!"
1042,5,Holds a great charge!  Picking some up for my flash units.  Found this through my photog site and I'm hoping it lives up too it's name being the that these are the new battiers.
1043,4,"After reviewing a number of earbuds and earphones, I chose not to spend a lot of money for my first purchase to replace my iPod earbuds. I did not want to be disappointed if I had spent upwards of $100 - $300 as some people were. These had a good review from a number of purchasers.  They do have a pretty good sound for $20 - a lot better than the phones that come with the iPod.  They also block out quite a bit of noise if worn properly.  The set comes with several sizes of buds so that you can choose what fits your ear best!   If you want an inexpensive set with good sound, this is your product."
1044,5,"Not much else that i have to say about this product since I'm not good with all this stuff.  Their good CD's and they burn my stuff fast.  Other than that, they were a good price."
1045,2,"I purchased this item because my TV doesn't have an HDMI plug.  I did not realize this harness requires an additional product that costs 50 dollars.  I used component rca wires instead and TV is great.  Amazon allows one to return items free shipping.  This company doesn't.  Now I am a proud owner of a wireing harness I can't use.  Next time I use Amazon I will pay closer attention and buy \\""only\\"" from Amazon.  Buyer beware."
1046,5,"I don't have 3D equipment beyond the blu-ray player I just purchased recently, but so far this cable has performed excellently.  I am very happy with it and the price is outstanding."
1047,5,"I bought this to run HDMI from my A/V receiver to my Mitsubishi HC4000 HD projector.  I am impressed with the quality of the cable, especially the casing.  The connectors make a firm connection to my projector and receiver. I ran this through my attic and down my wall to a wall plate in my media room equipment cabinet.  Based on the casing wrapped around the cable I am confident that this cable will last for a number of years.<br /><br />I haven't run a HD signal over this cable yet.  So far I've simply played DVD's on my Blueray player.  When I have viewed Blueray and HD TV content I will update this review."
1048,5,"This is an outstanding portable radio.  I purchased this to use with my Boy Scout troop for outings since the rechargeable batters have a very long life.  We could turn this on for short periods of time to get weather or news (or tunes while we unloaded gear and it will easily work for several days without being pluged in.  I did op for the case as this makes carrying it much easier using a shoulder strap. All in all this is a great product.  It has one of the best tuners I've every used.  It sounds great with an iPhone or iPod pluged in!  Other than the fact that it is pricy I can think of only one other con for this unit, the screws on the battery door are soft and the heads can easily strip if you don't use EXACTLY the right size screwdriver.  After years of use I've just replace my first battery.  Easy to find one on Amazone and at $22.00 for the replacement I can happily say it has cost me only about 6 or 7 dollars a year to replace the battery. Oh by the way, rain doesn't bother this unit much either.    Highly recommended."
1049,5,"These CDs are great for anything. These are great for just aboutanything, no IO errors while burning large files unlike memorex brand.    Great buy!"
1050,5,"I'm not really an eco nut, in fact I'm the opposite. I'm a conservationist, but I've gone far afield from my point. So far I have love this box. I take it in my kayak while I fish and it has been wet repeatedly. Still holding up. I really like it."
1051,5,"Installed these speakers about two weeks ago.  I am using them outside on the patio.  I have used them with my mp3 player outside,from my computer in the house and off of the TV in my kitchen.  I have had no problems getting them to work.  One speaker did have minor receiving problems when I placed it behind a brick pilaster, however the problem went away when I moved it 5 inches away.  No, the speakers do not sound like a concert hall, but I only paid $85 for them. I think they have very acceptable sound for outside where there is always considerable competing noises, day or night.  I have mainly used them plugged in so I do not know how long the batteries last.    It would have been nice to have a remote which would turn them on and off as well as control the volume. However, on most of the competitive speakers the remote they supply only did the volume control. Other competing speakers did not even have stereo sound. I recommend them highly for outside use, or for occasional in the house where you do not have regular wired stereo available.    Note  8/23/11:  I have changed my rating from 5 stars to 1 star.   One of the speakers has gone bonkers and picked up a lot of static.  the other one is still working good.  I am going to have to see about getting a replacement.    Note  8/25/11:   As it turns out, the problem with the speaker was one bad battery.  I found it out when the transmitter stopped receiving a signal from my audio player.  I put in some of the batteries that I had taken out of the bad speaker.  The transmitter did not work. I plugged it in to the adapter and it worked. I got out my battery tester and sure enough, one of the batteries was bad.  I put fresh batteries in the transmitter and in the speaker and, lo and behold, everything is working again.  I'm a happy camper. Back to 5 stars."
1052,3,"Could be good for itouch but dont work fine with my ipod nano 6G, some functions dont work. The sound is ok but it's nothing to write home about."
1053,3,"I had a Sony dock but read about how good Kicker docks sound, particularly with respect to bass. My two biggest issues with my Sony dock were I couldn't get anywhere near enough bass, and the volume wouldn't necessarily go as high as might be nice sometimes. I got my Sony dock for $40 but I know at one point it definitely cost more than that. It was a perfectly acceptable dock. I saw a newer version of, basically, the same Sony dock in the store the other day, and it is $100.     I recently spent $100 more on this Kicker dock ($143, and that was on sale) than my Sony dock and, while it is also a good dock, I don't feel the extra money was justified. The sound quality difference is not that far off, though there is a little more bass maybe and the volume can go high as others have mentioned. At the same time, I am willing to be understanding about the bass due to the size of the unit--when you look at it that way, it does sound pretty good for its size, which is not too much bigger than some alarm clocks are. The music sounds crystal clear and not distorted. It reminds me of how CDs used to sound to us when we first started listening to them, only without the CD spinning sounds. I could listen for hours.     Some of the other problems with it, though:    -I found it a little difficult to operate at first. It's not, in my opinion, an intuitive machine where you can immediately take it out of the box and understand on your own how to work it. I really had to refer to the guide and/or just learn from doing/making mistakes for setting the clock, programming stations, changing the bass/treble, etc. This is probably normal for a lot of people, but this is coming from someone who is good with electronics, knows how to take computers/laptops apart and is pursuing a career in Information Technology, i.e. I don't normally have to refer to guides when I get a new electronic product.    -Um. Conflicting info about which generations of the iPhone/iPod Touch it works with. I'd gotten the impression that this works with my iPod Touch generation from Amazon...for one thing, the site has listed this item under the \\""frequently bought together with\\"" my generation. The Kicker site and the box this product came in do not list my iPod Touch (I am currently using a 3rd gen iPod Touch). The odd thing is I think the box lists some older iPod Touch/iPhone gens that it works with but not mine...???? Why would it work with 4th and 2nd gen but not my 3rd gen? And so I put my Touch on the dock just to see (because I knew, either way, I could use the auxiliary cable), and it does work...but it's glitchy. If I'm playing music that's on my iPod Touch, songs will just stop in the middle and move on to the next song, settings on the iPod Touch will somehow change and the current song coming to an end will loop back and play again when that's not what was originally selected, and if I am playing music from an application there will be different complications...like, playing music with Slacker, it seems every few songs the current song will just stop in the middle and I go to my iPod Touch to find that the Slacker application has been exited. Sometimes when the iPod Touch is just sitting idle on the dock, it randomly will make sounds, like a sound indicating the dock has just been turned on/plugged in or like the sound it makes when you first hook it up to the dock or a charger. All of this happens even after I have made sure the iPod Touch is securely on the dock. I am, right as I type this, just playing my iPod Touch through the auxiliary cord to avoid these kind of things and am having no problems. I did not have these glitches with the Sony dock, and that dock seems to work fine with most iPod Touch/iPhones.     -Another reason I am using the auxiliary cord and think I generally will just stick with that is because there is no remote included with this dock. My choice was between this Kicker and the iKick501, I believe it's called. Both are lacking in some way--the 501 lacking FM/AM radio, which my Sony had, and this one lacking a remote...um, which my Sony had, also. So, at least with the aux cord, I can just lay my iPod Touch beside me and pick it up when I want to change the song or volume rather than get up and cross the room as if this is the 1970s. And that other iKick costs too much money to JUST be a dock with no radio on it (around $300, and yes, I do still like to see what's on the radio every now and then)...I thought that was nuts.   ---  Conclusion: It does have great volume and sound good, especially for its size (I've had bigger stereos that haven't sounded this good), but I really could have stuck with my cheaper Sony dock or bought that $100 dock from Sears and gotten nearly the same thing with a little bit more in some ways, i.e. a remote control. This is a dock that is similar to the one I had and similar to the one I saw in Sears, if not the exact same one from Sears (and it's cheaper here than in Sears).   [...]"
1054,5,"My 8 year old son saved for some time to buy an iTouch.  He couldn't afford brand new so bought a used older version.  It seems to do what he's interested in-- which is mostly games.  I'm able to password protect the internet so he's unable to go on-line or download things without my knowledge.  I'm not the primary user of this device, so my rating is based on what I've observed from the sidelines.  My son has no complaints."
1055,1,"This product is rubbish. The vibrations doesn't transcend any bass. The vibrations are so minute i can't feel it on my ears. Waste of my $34.

The cable is weird, one long cable to the right ear and a really short cable to the left."

1060,4,"I needed headphones for my laptop (so not to annoy those around me).  I bought them based on reviews I read and agree with the other positive reviews.  I would have given them a 5 star rating but find the headphones lack the higher sounds, and a muffled sound.  But then, what can one expect for $17.00!  If I were paying up over $100 I would expect a full range of sound.    For what the Koss is and the price I give them 4 stars."

1062,3,"The item works nicely, and having the ability to control my AV receiver wirelessly with the iPod itself is a very cool feature. As others have indicated, the inability to play videos from the iPod on the AV receiver with this unit is a pretty big drawback.    I knew that going in, but purchased the unit for my downstairs AV setup because I wanted to be able to take the iPod outside and control the ipod play on my receiver when we are at the pool. Two major issues I have encountered:  1. The range on the unit is not as good as I expected, and forget about the remote unit transmitting signals to the receiver unless you are in the same room; the wireless signal will certainly not transmit through windows - so do not even think about being able to transmit through walls.  2. if you move at all with the remote unit while the iPod is playing on the receiver, you lose the connection and audio cuts out until you are stationary again..    I also purchased the YDS-12 for my upstairs AV system, and that is fantastic - working EXACTLY as advertised. If I had it to do all over, I would have bought 2 of those."
1063,4,"I bought this to serve as my primary alarm clock.  I love it.  Everything I need to know when I get up in the morning is right there on my nightstand.

1064,5,"Very happy with this product. I use 1 for my glasses, 1 for my TV, 1 for my DSLR camera, I keep 1 in the car and 1 in my backpack for convenience, and I gifted the last one.  Works really well, much better than those small rags you get for free from certain places, these are nice and big."
1065,1,"After you throw away the blister-pak, the cable is just stamped Lextron (NOT Monster). After hours wasted by this defective cable I looked and looked until I found this cable so I could warn other consumers NOT TO BUY. It is labelled Lextron on both connectors. As well as I recall it was marked \\""Monster\\"" only on the top copy in the blister pak -- nowhere else, so I have doubts it is a \\""Monster\\"" cable.<br /><br />I bought the cable in November in anticipation of moving to Hi-Def equipment during Christmas season. When we got our Hi-def TV and Blu-Ray disc player, this cable was used from the Blu-Ray to the TV. Both devices gave error messages from the outset, but being new to hi-def and networked devices (both the TV AND Blu-Ray Disc Player have built-in internet applications such as Netflix and Pandora)connected to the internet via new dual band Netgear router and new comcast cable modem, I ignored the error messages. Turns out the error messages were all due to this cable.<br /><br />Eventually, the Blu-Ray would not even \\""wake-up\\"" until I got down under the equipment and wiggled the cable connector. I still didn't put it together as the cable (I thought the blu-ray player was just lo-end or defective since I paid only $120 @Costco). Then, a week ago I purchased a top-of-the-line Yamaha RX-A3000 Receiver. This receiver refused to play at all with the Blu-Ray input. To test whether problems were caused by this Monster/Lextron cable I whipped out a $7.95 Amazon Basic HDMI cable - replaced the Monster Cable and all error messages and no play problems were IMMEDIATELY CORRECTED!<br /><br />Avoid this blister-packed piece of crap. You will be glad you saved yourself the frustration.<br /><br />BTW - bought my son-in-law a Roku box for Christmas.

1067,1,"I'm one of the many people who saw the many 5 star reviews and immediately rushed to buy these headphones. I quickly became one of the many people who realized that it's impossible to use this product!<br /><br />It is absolutely impossible for you to keep these on your head, defeating the purpose of wireless headphones. The problem lies in the design of the ear part of the headphones: they're not indented at all! This means there is no way for them to hug your ear and stay on your head like a normal set of headphones.<br /><br />The ear area is completely flat and isn't made of a material that would at least attempt to stick to your skin like leather might. As soon as you put them on your head you immediately notice how unlikely they are to stay put. As soon as you nod your head forward (like some people might do when they listen to music!) they'll slide right off. If you want to listen to music from your computer while doing things around the house, forget it!<br /><br />What's the point of cordless headphones if simply moving your head around causes them to fall off?<br /><br />I only used them for about 2 minutes before realizing they sucked and I couldn't keep them on my head. I did notice the hissing that people are always talking about, but it goes away when the music comes on. I walked into the next room in my house (about 25-30 ft away) and the quality didn't change at all.<br /><br />So if you plan on listening to music nonstop, the sound quality isn't bad. But if you're like me and sometimes you want to pause a song so you can read/do something, you have to listen to the annoying hiss.<br /><br />Cliffs:<br /><br />-The headphones are worthless because they DO NOT STAY ON YOUR HEAD. If you sit extremely still and don't plan on getting up or moving your head or really ANYTHING, they stay on your head.<br /><br />-There is an annoying hiss when you're not listening to something."
1068,5,"I love this audio tower!!  We have a flat panel mounted above the fireplace so this was perfect to put next to the fireplace and not take up too much room.  My mom loved it so much she bought one.  Only downside on hers, it came with a couple of broken/bent pieces."

I really enjoy the range of stations that this unit can access.  Over several thousand!  Only downside is that if you have a favorite station and it is not on Grace's list, you have to ask for it and wait for them to put it on the list.    I would definitely buy this unit again."
1070,5,"I'm sitting here dumbfounded, trying to figure out how Music Fidelity pulled this off.  This silly little  box, looks like a high school electronics project.    This is the best $300 I have ever spent on improving my music.    By system I mean I'm running songs from my iPad via Airplay through my Apple TV2.      I connected an optical out on the Apple TV2 to the VDAC input.  From there I have R and L audio   cables going into my Yamaha AV receiver.    First of all, I don't understand how just sampling something thousands of times more than usual  actually results in better music.  It just does, trust these reviews.    The VDAC makes all my digitally streamed music sound great. Slightly warm, almost tubelike  on vocals. The soundstage is bigger and wider, more front to back placement of instruments.  The   bass is brilliantly defined.  I can easily separate the instruments across the soundstage.    I'm not just listening to music anymore, on some songs I'm traveling through it!    Now all my iTunes sound like CD or SACD quality, even better, any harshness is gone, and so is   listener fatigue.  I have a pair of Axiom M80 speakers, and they can totally immerse you in music   at low volumes.      I just made all my music files great, and all stream right from my iPad.      My musical universe just expanded exponentially.  Great product, well worth the money."

1074,3,"This decal is good quality and adhered beautifully to my Nook Color.  For these reasons I gave it the 3 stars.  However, the color was really misrepresented.  I know color varies from monitor to monitor, but it clearly appears more of an olive or slightly yellowy-green in the photo.  When I received it, the decal was a very unattractive bright green.  Sadly, I just wasted about $20."
1075,2,"I'm not a 'sound' guru, although I have family members who are, and I'm really not that picky. I purchased this system looking for something to play my ipod on that also had a radio and CD capability. I wanted something that could carry a decent sound at higher volumes (but I'm no teenager.... just wanted to be in the shower and hear music from the adjacent bedroom!). This system, or at least the unit I purchased, had a vibration even when the volume was less than halfway. I tried to tolerate it initially because it was the only aspect of the system I was disappointed with, but it was just too frustrating to listen to. I ended up sending the system back, which Amazon took gladly and paid the shipping. I purchased a different system, a Panasonic, that was a little bit more expensive, but I really like it. It has great sound with no vibration!"

1077,2,AT first it took longer and longer for the sound to come back on after powering it down.  Then one day it quit working.  It seems this is problematic with this device.  I need something thin and long to stick on a fireplace mantel under the tv and this is it.  it wall mounts.  but it has a sound defect problem and most likely I will complain to the manufacturer...although after 2 years?  I wish someone made a better one with the same design.  I like have the dvd player built in like this
1078,5,"The simple fact is, Monster Cable isn't always the most cost-effective solution.    Digital signal is either there completely or not there at all due to its binary nature.  So barring any extraneous effects on that digital/binary signal (old electronics, EMI/RF leakage, long-runs, animals chewing on the cable, etc...), any digital cable will get the digital signal from the source to the destination.  And this cable has worked perfectly for me for over a year...    AmazonBasics even makes HDMI 1.3-rated cables..."

1082,4,"Found the literati in Kohl's before Christmas, on sale, with Kohl's bucks to be returned, a rebate (filed, not received) AND I had a 30% off Kohl's coupon, so decided to give e-reading a try for a net outlay of $35. DH received it for a gift and I fiddled with it a bit to make everything work smoothly - which really didn't take much effort.     My advice is to log into the wi-fi network with the literati every so often and get the software updated. This seems to occur once or twice a month and will likely help with the bugs some have. Then you also have the latest and greatest reference to see what is going on.     If your battery seems to get used up fast, make sure you don't have wi-fi on unless you need it. You can also adjust the brightness of the display.     After the initial charge up, you can charge your literati while reading.     There isn't an indicator if it is charging or fully charged unless you turn it in on. That could be improved. The enclosed documentation did not indicate the length of warranty or how to get warranty service, so that isn't good. It does not have audio, so you cannot have your book read to you.     Our library system uses Adobe Digital Editions to check out e-books (and the library does not support Kindles). So we put that app on our regular computer (for free) and then USB connect the literati to load it with library reading. Works well for us.     It came with a case, a usb to computer connector and a wall charger in white.     Overall, it was a very inexpensive way to learn about e-books and experience e-reading. I like the color display (would be good for magazines or children's books) and that you can make the type larger (great for senior's eyesight)."
1083,4,"I bought this product for $2.08, a great deal, and it came with free shipping because I was ordering some other things as well.

It also felt like they were poking me with little needles when I wore them.  Then then this week the right ear quit producing sound!  I only use them maybe once a week for 45 minutes.  They also fall out of my ears when I start sweating!  These are the worst ear buds I have had!!"
1085,4,"Overall, I think it was a good buy for the twenty-ish bucks I spent on them.  Be warned, though, that used wirelessly they are VERY staticy when the headphone volume isn't super low.    I use them for listening to the TV while riding on an exercise bike.  They're not noise canceling, but they do block out a little bit of sound.  To deal with the crazy amount of static, I turn the headphone volume way down and the stereo volume way up (loud enough that if I forgot to turn it down before using the speakers, I think it would blow them out).  They work just fine for that, and it's a lot easier than trying to figure out what to do with a chord while riding the bike and getting my Battlestar Galactica fix at the same time.      Pros:  -They're pretty good quality when you use them wired, and they come with a (relatively short) double male jack to use them that way.  -They're very low price  -They do work as a wireless headphones (albeit with pretty short range)    Cons:  -There is A LOT OF STATIC sound when wireless (which, weirdly, goes away if I hold my hand next to the left ear piece)  -The static gets pretty ridiculous beyond about 8 feet, to the point that they're unusable beyond 12 or so feet  -They're not terribly comfortable (but not awful)"
1086,3,This rack mount kit does exactly what it`s supposed to but the big drawback is the price. With shipping I had nearly 30 dollars invested in two pieces of bent metal and four screws. The CD player was only 100 dollars! My suggestion is make your own.

1088,3,"Bose Acoustimass speaker systems are a strange animal.  You either love them or hate them.      It's a funny thing, This guy was at my house and heard my Quad ESL speakers (electrostatic) ($5,000) with about $6,000 worth of electronics and made the comment that they sounded almost as good as his Bose.      So there you go, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder.    Myself, I'm not too keen on Bose and I could go on a tirade about what I don't like about them, but in the end, it's what you think.  If they make you happy, then by God, you've made the right choice.    Bose are very colored speakers, bright highs and warm syrupy bass.  This is a sound that many people like.  The fact that they don't take up much room fits into many lifestyles.      If you like accuracy and want to get closer to real, then try something else.      For me, Bose has a pleasant sound that is nice to listen to at low volume when I just want background sound.  I can even think of other uses for these, in non critical applications.  I've even considered them for a second TV.  They are much better than the speakers that come in TV's nowadays.     For the $399 they are asking for these,  you could do much worse.  You could also do much better depending on your preferences.      Would I recommend these?  Sure, depending on whether someone wanted a small unobtrusive system or whether they liked the Bose sound.  If I felt the person was inclined toward accuracy, clarity, and soundstaging, then I would steer them away from these.      Does Bose deserve all the accolades that it receives?  Not really.  They are very over rated, but still, they're not bad speakers.    I gave these a 3 star rating only because in some circumstances these are perfect for the application.  If I were to rate it against my preferences, I would give it a lower rating.    BTW, this applies to all Acoustimass systems.    Oh, there's one more thing...    Bose likes to use the direct/reflecting concept of sound.  This has the effect of making the sound more spacious, but it destroys the soundstaging.  People in high end audio go to great efforts to eliminate or disperse reflections, because it ruins soundstaging and causes frequency aberrations (nulls and peaks)."
1089,5,"I ordered this run wallet in black for the gym. I needed a place for my id, a credit card, and money if I need it. A key or two will also fit nicely for your house, car, or gym locker. I put the strap around my ankle, but it also comes with a lanyard, or you can attach it to your shoe, belt, or arm. It it comfortable and well-made. The band is light-weight and durable. This also provides an extra secure place to stow extra cash or id while traveling. Highly recommend!"
1090,3,"I purchased two of these units to mount two Sony Bravia 32 inch LCDs in a home studio.  Pulling focus in HD is a whole lot easier with these monitors mounted on the wall.  I was meticulous about the installation.  Stud finders on interior walls work fine, levels and squares in hand I had not much trouble mounting the articulating arms.  The problem with these mounts is the machining of the parts at the joints of the arms.  When mounted, the top of the screen will drop up to 1/2 inch on one side and raise the same amount on the other, depending on in what degree of extension the monitor is placed.  The screens have a noticeable tilt in all but one position throughout the range of motion.  There is a +/- six degree tilt adjustment built into the unit.  If you buy one, be sure to leave it loose enough that you can adjust the tilt because you'll need to adjust it EVERY TIME you move it.  This is a \\""both hands on the monitor\\"" type of thing.  Were the build quality better, I would have given it a higher rating as all the hardware required was included, instructions were clear and it installs and trims out just fine.  Note also though, there is no means for hiding cables other than wire-tying them to the arms.  Good luck."
1091,4,"The product is awesome, no complaints about how it works and sounds but be careful, this is NOT an 100% wireless system. I thought it was from what I read but...surprise!!You will still have running cables behind your couch!"
1092,3,"The idea of the bearing is to help support a antenna mast. I found that the bearing is not of tight tolerances. The bearing is loose and moves around and has nothing for grease.It also looks like a ball bearing is missing.The company that makes it states that it does not need to be of tight tolerance because of what it is used for. It does have a cover on the top to help keep the rain out but eventually it will rust.I believe that for longevity the bearing it should be tighter and be greased. If not greased or a sealed bearing that has grease in it, to much of a chance that bearing will prematurely default and need to be replaced. This is especially when used for a rotating antenna in which this would be why the bearing is used in the first place. It seems that this is the only bearing available. If you need a support bearing for this application it's the only game in town. Thanks Gary"
1093,3,"I've had these headphones for a few weeks now, and have worn them at work, running, in the gym, on the bus, etc.  The headphones come with a variety of sizes/types of rubber earpiece attachments, none of which I find comfortable.  The sound is quite good, and the bass is great for such small headphones, but I find my ears hurt after having the headphones in for 30 min.  This is especially true when running, as the rubber earpieces tend to rub back and forth in my ears.  The cord is somewhat heavy for headphones (it is flat and 3x the width of Ipod earbuds), but they do contain a small nub 1/4 of the way down the cord that keeps the headphones from getting tangled.  It has a clip that can be attached to the headphone cord to pin to your shirt, but I haven't found this to help much in the way of comfort.    Overall - very good sound quality, but not very comfortable in my opinion.    *Update 4/1/11* - After about 3 months, the right headphone volume dropped to a point where it was almost inaudible.  I went to the jlabaudio website and was given the option of replacing the headphones free of charge, or upgrading to the same pair of headphones with a mic (see JBuds J4M) for $20 extra with a new 1-yr warranty.  I opted for the latter, and it arrived within a week.  Mic addition seems to work well, and has a single button for lowering the volume.  I notice, however, that if you continue to press the button until the volume is off, the next press will drop the call.  This may or may not annoy some people.    *Update 9/13/11* - It's been about 5 months since I received my new set of JBuds (with microphone) and the exact same issue occurred as before. This time, the left headphone volume dropped to a point where it is almost inaudible. I will opt to receive another pair as they are still under warranty, but I'm disappointed that this is a recurring problem. I left the 3-star rating as customer service has been quick to respond.    <Note that you do not have to send in your old headphones to receive a replacement under warranty>"
1094,5,"I bought these head phones to use with a Jabra Bluetooth transciever.  http://www.amazon.com/Jabra-BT3030-Headset-wireless-Bluetooth/dp/B00164CRDC    They work great for both music and conversation.  They are light weight, and do a great job of noise cancellation.  They sound quality is MUCH better than I expected at this price point.    Recommended for small MP3 players for runners or work outs."
1095,5,I have a 12 foot monster cable for my sub and I just got this cable for my dad's.  We have the exact same systems and I notice no difference in sound quality between the two cables.  The only difference is the monster cable was $50 and 12 feet long.  The belkin was $12 and 25 feet.
1096,5,"I have to start of by saying that the sound quality from this ipod speaker dock belies it's small stature. From this beautiful, glossy little unit comes a sound that is balanced, warm and rich and it manages to fill the room with sound whilst taking up minimal space. I bought mine for use at work and it sits unobtrusively on my workbench and yet puts out a sound comparable to larger, higher spec competitors.<br /><br />This comes with cradles for various apple products so you should be able to find one to fit your phone or ipod and it charges it up at the same time as playing your music so you will always be able to grab your player/phone knowing it will be fully charged and ready to go. This comes with a remote control that you can use to adjust volume, repeat tracks, turn on the bass boost (although I found the bass more than adequate without), and navigate the menus on the ipod to find whatever track you may want. You can also play other MP3 players through this via the audio input, but you will need to buy a lead to link it up. This feels reassuringly well made and the weight isn't excessive but makes it feel substantial rather than a flimsy electrical device. The piano wood cabinet is a nice touch as well, I have had many complimentary remarks about how it looks and sounds already.<br /><br />This was easy to set up straight out of the box and the enclosed booklet guides you through any bits you may not be sure of, but to be honest it is all very intuitive. I tried out quite a few other ipod speaker docks and researched online before I chose this and I have to say I am very happy with this purchase; it is relatively inexpensive (compared to some other units out there) and the sound really is very impressive for such a small, compact speaker dock. I would not hesitate in recommending this.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
1097,4,"My daughter uses her iPod Touch with augmentative communication software to \\""speak\\"" for her.  The Touch's built-in speaker is wholly inadequate, but with the swing speaker it is portable, audible, and easy to use."
1098,5,"this unit has amazing sound quality! the built-in rechargeable battery is also quite nice as you can keep it plugged in while using it in the kitchen and then take it to another room for a few hours without having to plug it in at the new location. the adjustable angle of the iphone plug-in means it even works with some cases, depending on case thickness. the remote is nice although i'm not certain how much we'll actually use it. the size is a little large if you're looking for a very portable unit; we were looking for a unit primarily for the kitchen but allowing for some portability and excellent sound quality and these speakers fit the bill perfectly. this unit also charges your iphone when it is docked which is an extra bonus.    overall, quite pleased with this unit, exactly what we were looking for."
1099,5,wonderful sound quality with very rich bass and very glad I bought them after 3 months they sound even better than when I first got them and for $15 what a deal!
1100,5,"I got a new Samsung speakerbar/subwoofer for Christmas to improve the audio on my Sharp TV but could not control it with my Time-Warner Cable supplied remote.  Didn't want to confuse my wife with two remotes so started looking into some other universal remotes.  I had looked before and always saw $70+ as the price but when I saw the Harmony 300 was less than $40 thought I would take a chance.  What a great product!!  Just connect to your computer, download the software, put in the model numbers of what you want to control and after it syncs, you're done.  Everything worked great right from the start (with only a slight learning curve - buttons are very similar to TWC remote).  I have a new toy and the wife will hopefully remember how it works over the next few days.  Highly recommended."
1101,3,"This is the third flavor of these that I have tried (raspberry and lemon were the others).  I would say it's better than the lemon, but definitely worse than the raspberry.  The lemon tastes like cleaning fluid, so it's not hard to beat.  It might have been because I bought this from a 3rd party seller and it was expired----not sure how that would affect the taste.  However, it tastes pretty fake and slightly like cleaner.  I would recommend raspberry over the peach."
1102,5,For me the white blended into the background better than black. Otherwise the black version of this cable was just fine. Cabled to Go usually makes great products. I was not dissapointed. When hooked up there was no hum or electrical audio interference.
1103,5,My daughter wanted a new pair of Skull Candy headphones for Christmas and these are perfect! The earbuds don't fit into her ears easily so the larger ones worked perfectly. The pink color was great and priced $15-$20 cheaper than the ones I looked at in the stores.
1104,3,I have been impressed with this item.  It looks sleek and sounds good in our fitness room.  We even connected our TV to it.
1105,5,This is a must buy item. I'm so impressed with the deep bass that i may buy another so i can really shake things up. I was looking at higher priced subs and thankfully i bought this one because with the savings i am able to buy more Polk equipment and still get the deep bass i was looking for. Installation was easy and i was able to get a free polk 111 sub with my order. Amazon is great as usual!!
1106,5,"I was very excited to get my iPod, and was not disappointed at all. It's cute, fun, and effective. I love it."
1107,1,"could not do anything with it, barely had enough power to light the LED power light on it. garbage. gigantic waste of time. at least it was cheap. threw away the first day."
1108,5,"i researched over a bunch of mp3 players including the ipod nano ($150) before settling on this one. my review is based on how this product fulfilled my needs. i mainly use it in the car while commuting to work. so battery life  is more than enough. it's been 2 weeks and the battery line just barely moved down. drag and drop to add the songs is fast and simple. charger/sync with min usb interface is universal and was very important to me. i was able to use my garmin nuvi cigar charger for the sansa in the car without having to buy a new one. since i always play songs at random i haven't used the folder system but it looks straightforward. the fm receiver is why i went with this particular model. it is not too bad and i use to hear the remainder of my NPR news if i reach my destination too early. 4G has lots of room for songs. plays .mp3, .wma files and had no problems so far playing any. got the blue and it is really great. bought it from best buy. i believe the quality of this player is as good any other out there and the price is so reasonable. very lightweight and small but the buttons are easy to manage. in short it has all that i need from an mp3 player. came with earphones and usb cable. one thing to note is that it says you have to upload the attached raphsody to start using the player. this confused me a bit and then i figured i can ignore the whole thing and just drag and drop my collection of songs as needed."
1109,5,"Great quality, range of motion is nominal.  Only con would be that there is no clip or channel for your cables to run through."
1110,5,"Excellent headphones for the price! you're in no danger of wasting money with this purchase. fully functional, block out sound surprisingly well."
1111,5,"I was having wrist problems, and my fingers would get tingly. I found the HandShoeMouse which helped me there, but I had neither the desk nor the pad that was appropriate. This gaming surface completed my \\""remedy.\\"" I recommend this combo to anyone suffering from carpel problems."
1112,4,These speakers are really great! The battery seems to live forever and the sound is hugely satisfying for that size (there are bigger speakers with less quality)! Just be aware that the speakers do only have a usb connector (stereo) unlike the single soled speakers which operate with a jack-plug.
1113,5,"I'm a programmer who works in a shared office with 6 others, and find it hard to stay focused when someone comes in to talk specs with one of the other fellas.  I tried out my co-worker's Bose Quiet Comfort 15's one day and **LOVED THEM**.  They created nearly perfect sound isolation and phenomenal sound (it was like I was in teh studio with the Branford Marsalis Quartet).  Of course, those Bose headphones are $300 (and on my Christmas wish list).    I found these Panasonic's on Amazon for only $40, and they are a great value!  While they don't give the level of isolation that Bose's do, they are about 50%-60% as good when it comes to quieting down conversations.  It also helps to have music playing.    They really do a GREAT job with background noise like HVAC hum.  I wanted to show off the noise reduction to my daughter, so we went to the laundry room while the washer and dryer were both whirring loudly.  These Panasonics cut them out nearly completely.  She wants a pair now because she studies a lot in the common areas of her campus.    The sound quality is very good.  Again, not Bose-level, but they sound as good (or better) than any other earbuds I've used.    The Panazonics include 3 sizes of ear pieces.  I use the largest size, even though they are a tiny bit large for my ear canals.  The extra seal helps with the noise cancelling.    My only compaint is the cord length.  Specifically, the cord from the noise reduction device to the earbuds is too short.  It's not even long enough to reach my belt (I'm 6' 2\\"").  If I move too far while I'm at my desk, the noise reduction mechanism will slide off and yank the phones from my ears.  If there was an extra 6\\"" of cord, they would be perfect."
1114,1,"It's been a month that I have sent my order and still have not received the item, neither been notified by USPS that have received the item from the vendor. I have sent e-mail of complaints to the vendor and never got an answer back. I'm frustrated."
1115,4,My Bose Soundock system died for reasons not clear to me.  The Bose system is okay but is grossly overpriced at $300.  I spent an inordinate amount of time looking at and listening to potential replacememts.  I came on one of these at a BestBuy and a b'd to everything there.   In my view there is a lot of bass produced but I think it still has a better overall response level than most and I'm pretty particular.   The Soundock may seem smoother as it is all midrange but this system beats it hands down for overall sound reproduction.  Keep in mind that Yamaha has long been a high end audio brand - a much higher end brand than Bose or KLipsch or any of the others out there so the sonic performace of this unit should not be surprising.  No problem with power either - the unit can fill my large garage with ease.     I've liked this unit so much I have also purchased the clock radio/CD player unit for my master bedroom which is also excellent if you need the additional features.
1116,4,"Great unit and protection for the price. Insertion of plugs seemed much more difficult than it should be. I was afraid something was going to break each time that I added a plug. They didn't, but I am concerned about long term reliability of the blade contacts due to the way you have to twist the plugs while inserting.   It holds an amazing assortment and arrangement of plugs and as such is a tad bulky. So, if you have the space, this works very well."
1117,5,"Mainly I buyed this product one month ago.    Cons :    -- very sensitive screen. everything will scratch it.    -- Little video format is supported (actually only WMV)      My sugestion for this :    1) Buy screen protector.   2) The tranfert software is able to convert any video format to the WMV     format. Just you need to download the right codec.     My suggestion is to download software called \\""Free converter DIVX AVI MPEG\\"".     This software will install all the needed codec.      Note : Sony has released a new firmware for this product.          I tryed it and it look OK. Only the USB seems more faster and         they added the ability to configure custom equalizer settings.      Pro :    --  The sound is extreamly good if :        1) you must buy a descent pair of headset       2) the files used must be at least 160 Kps     -- The video is also good. No glitch (CPU is performing well)     and the resolution quality is good (for the little screen)    I tried with a least of Jazz music classified as the top 100 all time   and this little player sound sometime better than my CD player at home.    Sure this mean that I have to change it. Also, I am suprise usually sound  produced by sony is always without any suprise.    This product is good and I think it is better than any ipod for the quality  of music and manipulation of the files is easier.      Maybe will upgrade next year for a bigger screen."
1118,5,These headphones do exactly what they promise to do. I can either use the noise cancelling function or not. They work with either the noise cancelling function on or just as regular headphones.
1119,2,"While the design of these eargels look and feel great by themselves, the fit over the Jawbone Icon earpiece is poor and greatly oversized.  Seems as though the product was designed for a completely different headset and they added the Icon to the fit list without double checking.  Instructions or some packing other than a zip lock would certainly improve the presentation and if there is a trick to the fit or a product number, it could be verified.    Poor packaging, poor fit, nonexistent instructions, waste of money."
1120,5,"I bought a Dell E6510 as a desktop replacement, and it's fabulous.  I haven't turned on my old computer since I finished moving my files.<br /><br />Before you buy, find out what screen you're getting.  The E6510 has three options: 1366x768 (\\""HD\\""), 1600x900 (\\""HD+\\""), and 1920x1080 (\\""FHD\\"").  I got the gorgeous FHD screen which lets me comfortably have small but sharp browser window, editor window, and debugger window visible simultaneously.  I also got 4GB DRAM, 500GB hard disk, and Win 7 Pro.<br /><br />Build quality is excellent.  Drivers are stable.  Everything just plain works.  Lots of USB ports.  All the tools I want: WiFi, SD card reader, Bluetooth...  The 9-cell battery protrudes but gives several hours of run time.  Both touchpad and TrackPoint work great.<br /><br />Nits:  To make room for large top-facing speakers (which sound pretty good), the keyboard doesn't have a separate number pad; using the Fn key to select numbers is lame.  Dell docks don't have key locks like IBM docks.  To use Microsoft Backup, you must disable the \\""Latitude ON\\"" feature (which instantly boots a cached OS and starts your copy of Outlook to read e-mail) by converting D: to NTFS. Unfortunately, Microsoft Backup fails when it encounters a FAT32 partition.  The computer is big and heavy, like all the machines in this class.<br /><br />Pleasant surprises:  I didn't have to delete any craplets!  Dell accessories (spare power adapters, docks) are very inexpensive and readily available from many sources.  The i5-520M processor is incredibly fast.<br /><br />Just two regrets:  I wish I'd sprung for the backlit keyboard, and I wish I'd gone with the 6-cell battery."
1121,5,"We have an RV with three satellite input options.  We have the King Dome on the front of the roof of the RV, a MotoSAT in the middle of the roof of the RV, and a pair of coax fittings in a bay on the outside of the RV that can be fed from an external, tripod mounted dish.  Each of these three sources feeds two separate receivers in the RV, one for the front TV and one for the rear TV.    We feed the external dish source and the King Dome source into one SW21 at the front, and one SW21 at the rear Dish receiver location.  We then feed the output of those into two more SW21's, one at each location, along with the source from the MotoSAT, to make all three sources available to each of the two Dish receivers.  That's a total of four SW21's.  The system works great.    I would suggest not having more than one source locked onto a satellite, however, as the different coax lengths would no doubt present two seriously incompatible data streams to the receivers.  In other words, take care to have only one data source feeding into the network.  I am extremely happy with the results from the SW21 Multi-Dish Switch."
1122,5,"These headphones are great, the wires retract so there is no worry about them getting all tangled up, that's great!"
1123,5,"I've had this radio/cassette/cd boombox for 3 years now and it still performs exceptionally.<br /><br />There are many rare features on this unit that have long disappeared from other so-called boomboxes, such as a line input feature and a multiple equalizer/ amplifier system.  It also has a sleep feature (which I've never bothered to use) and has an impressive 4 speaker stereo output.<br /><br />The deal maker for me was the line-input jack (which, as been already stated, is the 1/8 jack.)  This is precisely what you'll need if you're going to connected it to your computer.  I had been sitting on boxes of interviews on cassettes that I had no way of transferring.  This radio instantly gave me the opportunity to digitize the recordings along with software I previously installed.<br /><br />The sound is rich and woofer system is indeed deep.<br /><br />If you're in need of a cassette deck with a line-input but don't want to spend $150+, this is a great alternative.  (I bought mine from BrandsMart in Miami for $69.99 and that was their stock price.)<br /><br />Great deal, nonetheless."
1124,4,"Im not fimilar with all the terms so reading the manual was a pain! We spent nearly two hours and couldnt get it to work and read everything in the manual which wasnt much help. It tells u, u can do this but go to page ** and then tells u what it does but to use it go to page ** and so on. And by the end we still couldnt figure it out. So we called tech support and they were great! Within 5 mins we had a person walking us through and helped getting it going right. The problem was our fault for not having a correct cord so ran to walmart and fixed it right up. Cord was only ten bucks so not a big deal. theres So many options and things u can set up on it seems confusing at first but its only day two and we are already getting use to it. Gave 4 stars just cause the manual is so confusing. So far so good!!! Would recommand purchasing. Our reason for getting was to get surround sound on video games like ps3 n 360. We just had a dvd player with speakers and would only put sound through the front two speakers. Now we have sound through all speakers for movies, games and tv!!"
1125,5,"My son loves this!! He can turn it sideways while still charging to view his youtube movies. It is compact in size...doesn't take up a lot of room on his bedside table. It travels well. We haven't had it long, but he is totally happy with his so far!! He has had other player/chargers and they did not fit his needs as well as this product does. We highly recommend this to anyone!"
1126,3,"I've had the headset for 5 weeks and used it for many many phone conferences.  I like the sound, the comfort, the range, and the freedom that wireless brings.  However, the battery life is awful.  The unit simply does not hold a charge.  I'll use it for a 1 hr meeting, set it down, turn it off, and leave for the day.  The next day during another 1-2 hour phone meeting the unit simply quits.  That can be very very annoying.  There is no warning, no beep, no solution, other than to plug it in and wait a few hours for a charge.      The USB cord that comes with the unit but is only a couple of feet long.  You can only listen while the unit is plugged in so continuing a conversation is not possible.  Bottom line is be prepared for the unit to cut out in the middle of a conversation.      It would be nice if I could change the batteries myself in the unit once they ran down."
1127,5,I have this binder for a year.  I love it so I want to buy more.
1128,5,"Greetings,    I have had no problems with the HP ink combo packs.    I recommend them for use."
1129,1,Ordered this item from seller and it did not charge and the batteries did not charge on my other charger. Called Kodak who said that if I send them the item postpaid with a fee they would look into it but it would take 4 to 6 weeks. I contacted the seller who promptly replaced the item at their expense and the replacement product was as bad as the original. I gave up on Kodak.  Jrw
1130,5,Vega rocks! I have tried other amps and was not at all happy with them. Take this amp and the cls 215 or the xls 215 and rock the house. I own all denon and vega equipment all over my house and will never consider anything else unless someone can compete and so far that has not happened.
1131,5,"ONE THING I CAN SAY ABOUT THIS BLANK MEDIA, ITS GREAT! I HAD NO PROBLEMS PLUS IS CHEAP AND VERY USEFULCOMPARED TO HP AND TDK, I OVE THIS BLANK MEDIA"
1132,3,It's an okay adapter but I should have paid a little more attention to the pics instead of the description. There are only 3 conductors on the male plug so it is not compatible with volume and song control.
1133,3,"The best thing about these earphones are the adjustable volume (sometimes you just don't want to pull out the device you're using and adjust the, sometimes inconvenient, system volume).  OK, like everybody's said, you might not use this for jamming Daft Punk at the loud gym.  Also the the wiring inside the earbud won't last too long.  Yet, I bought a replacement set (in an emergency) at the drug-store for $25 (what a rip-off); and, I'm getting 2 backups here, right now.  Well, I was going to but found a similar product I would not have to pay extra shipping for.  I like a slider volume control better than a wheel (which can get adjusted, blasting your ears out, on you while you move around)."
1134,5,"I'm totally pleased with this product. Nice design, clear picture as well as quality. Comes with a car charger for emergencies.    FYI: Get an external antenna... RCA Ultra-Slim Indoor Digital Flat Antenna - $9.99."
1135,4,"rt.Almost exactly what I need. Not very fansy sound, but good enough for its price."
1136,1,never got a chance to  use it received a defective one. had to return it.  Sanyo customer service was not very helpful.
1137,4,"My first impression was, \\""Where's the bass?\\"" In an effort to find out, not only did I give the BackBeat Pro in-ear-monitors (IEM) a breaking in, I tried them with 3 of the 4 pairs of tips they come with (I didn't try them with the child-sized tips). I also tried them with different kinds of music (bass-heavy dance, rock, and instrumental classical as well as opera), from different sources (two different classical stations available via the web, music played via Windows Media Player, and music played on my Sony MP3 player). After a breaking in period of less than 8 hours I thought I detected a slight improvement, but so slight that I found myself on the verge of returning them.<br /><br />It then occurred to me to try, as a last resort, the tips from IEM I own that fit me perfectly, those being the largest size tips that come with the JVC HAFX66 and the Sony MDR-EX082. I changed the tips, put on a bass-heavy song on my MP3 player from a live album by the German group Seabound, and finally BASS. I'd tested the IEM with the same song just a few minutes before changing the tips, and the difference was night and day. Having the just-right-for-me seal in my ears made all the difference between virtually no bass and the bass I would expect from IEM with a list price of a hundred bucks that are not marketed as being bass-heavy IEM. And I could not get that seal with any of the tips included with the BackBeat Pros. (Obviously this is subjective and has to do with my ears. Someone else might find one or more pairs of tips that come with the BBP's perfect for their ears, bass-wise and otherwise. I noticed that the tips that come with the BBPs lack the rubbery, \\""sticky\\"" quality that the JVC tips as well as the tips on the Sony buds that I mention below have. That rubbery, \\""sticky\\"" quality makes for a better, tighter, more lasting in-the-ear seal, in my experience. And I did try wetting the JVC tips before insertion after getting unsatisfactory results without wetting them, and it made no difference. Also, I've found that I get the absolute best sound when I use Comply T400 Foam Tips - size large for me - with the BackBeat Pros. Using the Comply tips brings both the listening experience and the noise isolation to a whole new level.)<br /><br />I find the BackBeat Pros to be excellent with mids and highs and good enough with bass. They may not have bona fide \\""reference\\"" quality sound, but they do have exceptionally clear sound and presence. I have also found that I can listen to them at much lower volume levels than required for the other IEM I own (the aforementioned JVCs and Sonys, and Sennheiser MX51 earbuds). Roughly, volume level 9 on my MP3 player with the Altec Lansings is as loud as volume 15 with the other buds (the maximum volume level that the MP3 player can go to is 30).<br /><br />These IEM have balanced armature speakers or a balanced armature transducer design. Balanced armature transducers are typically found in better-than-entry-level to audiophile quality IEM. (One can read more about balanced armatures at the Wikipedia entry for headphones.) In Altec Lansing's BackBeat line, which consists of 4 models (Classic, Plus, Titanium, and Pro, in order of least to most expensive), only the BackBeat Pro model uses the balanced armature transducer type. The others use dynamic transducers, typical of entry level IEM. The balanced armature transducers in the BackBeat Pros deliver sound that, with a proper seal in the ear canal, I find remarkably clear and present. Altec Lansing suggests that the BackBeat Pros produce \\""reference\\"" and \\""studio\\"" quality sound, and while that is an exaggeration, I find their fidelity impressive, and exceptional for the price I paid [...].<br /><br />Amazon is offering the BackBeat Pros for [...] until 2/22/10 as part of their \\""Our 10 Best Headphones Deals Right Now\\"" offer. I may order another pair or maybe 2 at [...], to have handy for gifts (they come in a nice box and with the included soft, padded andzippered carrying case make an impressive presentation). At this price they are a steal (at a list price of [...] they are the most expensive earphones in Altec Lansing's current catalog, and while that may be an inflated list price, it's not ridiculously inflated in the way that JLabs list price of [...] is for two of their IEM). I would, however, tell gift recipients that in my experience, they sound radically better to me with different tips, and that if they find that they are getting virtually no bass, they should try them with tips other than those supplied with them (alternative tips can be purchased at Amazon, Radio Shack, etc., such as Comply T400 Foam Tips, which fit the BackBeat Pros perfectly).impressive presentation).

1138,1,"The battery was well packaged, fast shipping. I enjoyed it very much, but my happiness didn't last long after 2X uses of battery. After 1 day, my battery would not charge anymore. As of now, I am trying to contact the seller for another one as mine might have been defective, hopefully they will replace mine.     The battery lasted about 2.5 hours with internet & video playback. When I first got it, I made sure to charge it 100% then when using I empty it completely to 9% before charging again.     I'll keep everyone posted as I am trying to contact the seller, but as for now my rating for this product is not so great."
1139,1,"I did not like this Body Glove product because of it's shape.  I like to keep my liner notes with my CD 's and this holder did not have square holders inside the case.  I like Body Gloves products when I can find them, this item just did not do the job for me."

Chuck it and call Comcast if it doesn't.  I have a attic with an ADT outlet right next to my home networking panel so it was a quick install for me to run the extension cord from the ADT outlet to the network panel that houses the phone and cable lines.  I have 9 flat panels all with cable boxes.  The last one we got put us over the edge and we couldn't access ON Demand or the higher channels (100 and above) on any of the TV's.  We were pulling too much energy from our cable lines and needed something to AMP up the signal.  As soon as I disconnected all the lines from our main 10 outlet splitter and used plugged them into the 8 splitter plus a simple three splitter connected to one of the outlets of the 8 splitter all TV's glowed and channels became available as did the ON Demand channels.  Now we did have our main line running from the pole to our home replaced last year. So, I did know that wasn't an issue. And I include that statement because: the instructions suggest the AMP may not be the solution; the main line may be the fault.  So, if  anybody has any problems or second thoughts it is a great buy.  For those curious I am running two 100 foot lines and the rest are 50 and 75 foot lines as well."
1141,1,"I received my first SanDisk Sansa Clip+ 8GB MP3 Player for Christmas '09.  I saw all the glowing reviews on Amazon so I put it on my Christmas list. It lasted me one week before it shut down and never worked again.  I contacted Amazon, who replaced the player in less than one week.  I had my second SanDisk for one week before it froze up and erased all my music and audio files (which took me at least an hour to dowload onto the player).  I was not hard on this player at all, but I did listen to it a lot when I had it.  The sound quality and ease of use was wonderful, but the durability leaves much to be desired.  No idea if it is a bad design or what the deal is, but I will never by this brand again."
1142,4,"I say one more star better if it had an aux input for a mp3 device. Then it would be perfect. My dad got this for me two years ago for Christmas. Not our taste to be honest but it was cool, too cool to do away with it. It's now out in the dinning area of the house and I use it more often than I thought I would. Like I said though, if only I could plug in my ipod it would be perfect! :)"
1143,3,This is a typical CD/DVD case and for the price is a good buy if you are looking for something basic.  The pages are a bit flimsy - not sure that they would hold up to a lot of wear and tear.  I bought it to store some DVDs that we will not be accessing often so I think it will would great for that.
1144,4,"I wanted to replace my clock radio for one that charges my iPod Touch & has decent sound. After sampling several models at the Apple Store & researching online, I picked this one. As a note, there is a previous model of this unit & there are some major differences. Since both are still available as of 1/14/10, you might want to decide which one works better for you. The differences are:  -The old one was shorter, designed for regular ipods. The Touch & the iPhone stuck out higher then the radio, which meant when reaching for the snooze or other buttons, you may hit the iphone/touch and knock it off.  -The old one has a smaller clock display.  -The old one had a BETTER ipod dock. It actually had a rest behind where the ipod stands, which could be adjusted from the back to go in or out. This to me was an amazing & rather unique solution.    The one I bought, the new one described in this item listing, has a bigger clock display & is taller so the touch and iphone no longer stick out on top. However, the dock no longer has the adjustable backrest like the older model. Instead, it comes with 2 plates, one for the iphone, one for the Touch. If you have another ipod, you'll have to bring your own dock plate.    The main problem with this dock plate solution is that my Touch doesn't fit with the protective case on (I use an Agent 18). Since taking the Touch out of the case everyday is not something I wish to do, I have to use this without any dock plates. The problem with that is the only support the Touch has is the dock port. This is obviously not a good thing in the long term. It makes using the Touch while it is docked a 2 hand operation; one to stabilize the Touch & keep it from pushing back & the other hand to make the adjustments. This is doubly frustrating since they had a much better docking solution in the older model.    I plan on glueing a piece of foam or other material on the radio behind where the Touch would be to support it.    Even with this caveat, I would still recommend this Sony. The price to benefit ratio, to me at least, is great. The sound quality and clock radio functions are excellent, especially when you factor in the price you paid.    Things I like:  -Excellent sound  -Lots of options for the clock radio; 2 alarms, different days of the week, can wake up to ipod, buzzer, or clock.  -Sleep function also works with listening to iPod  -Comes with external AM & FM antennas. Picks up stations I listen to without a problem.  -Electronic tuning for radio stations with presets  -Plays Pandora & other sound apps through the system also  -Buzzer for alarm works great. Starts off slow and low volume. Then increases in intensity after every hit of the Snooze bar.  -Clock auto sets & remembers time if unplugged. Only have to set time zone when you first set it up.  -Remote works with iPod and has decent range.    Things I don't like:  -Docking solution is a regression compared to the older model    Overall, I recommend this unit. If you don't use a case with your iPhone or Touch, than it would get 5 stars, IMO."
1145,5,"First, I am not used to in-ear earphones, so when I tried on Hearbeats, I was somewhat frustrated because they would not fit. However, after about 10 minutes of trying the different ear-tip sizes, I found the right fit.<br /><br />Second, I was not immediately impressed because I thought there would be more bass. However, after listening to a couple of songs, I realized how clear each song sounded. I don't feel the need to turn up the volume on my music player because the sound quality is VERY crisp. Beats sound sharp and intricate details in the music are apparent. External sound is hardly noticeable- so much that I hardly hear myself speaking.<br /><br />The only con is that when I dance or run, these Heartbeats have a tendency to slip. But besides that, Lady GaGa, Dr. Dre, and Monster did a great job with these earphones. Initially, Heartbeats seem overpriced, but they are not. Considering other high-performance earphones, like Bose, the price of Heartbeats make sense. Plus, there's a three-year warranty, and I have not had a pair of earphones that have lasted longer than one year.<br /><br />I would recommend these to anyone who wants to upgrade or replace their current head/earphones."
1146,5,"This has been a real surprise to all of us in our household! We just couldn't believe the sound that comes out of this little two speaker \\""alarm clock\\"". I've been into music for quite some time and have a great deal of audio equipment and for me to say I'm impressed is impressive. I'm very picky with how music comes through speakers. These of course don't have big bass or crushing volume but does get pretty loud and the quality of the music is very impressive. We bought two of these...one for my wife's Iphone and one for my daughters Ipod touch. They both love them! The dimmer on the clock is a really nice touch for light sensitive sleepers. The only thing I don't care for is that there's no battery backup. We had ours unplugged for a few hours by accident and lost time/date. It may have a internal capacitor to keep the time for a short time(like for quick power failures) but haven't tried it out yet. Just have to read the instructions to get the most out of this unit. Iphone and Ipod functions work great as well!! Listen to Pandora for hours on end while it's being charged!"
1147,5,"I live in an apartment in the city and have a surround system I rarely use.  If I turn the system up loud enough to drown out city noises, my neighbors complain, hence, the perfect solution is the Sennheiser wireless.  I can watch movies, shows, music with the headphone on and take care of tasks in the kitchen, throw out the trash, etc. without missing a beat. I'm no audiophile so everything sounds very true and in tune to me, even the surround feature.  In fact, my movie and TV watching experience is enhanced because I never miss whispered dialogue or subtle sound effects with these headphones.  The headphones themselves are constructed in a way that they don't pinch your head and provide just enough pressure from a 90 degree angle to your ears that they are quite comfortable even for excessively prolonged wearing.  I like these quite a bit and they certainly have enhanced my home entertainment experience."
1148,5,"I am very impressed at the sound you get from this item!  I use it at my desk at work and the small size makes it ideal for a small space and makes easy to stow in my computer bag.  I purchased rechargable batteries to make it more reasonable to use as I didn't like the thought of throwing out a lot of batteries.  There is an initial invetment with rechargables, but in the long run they make sense.  Great gift item!"
1149,5,"Excellent product, works great and for many different items. The ability to change the polarity is very good and with the many different plugs makes this a very usefull product."
1150,5,I bought this to extend an HDMI to DVI cable using another HDMI cable and this coupler. It works very well.
1151,5,"I purchased these through Amazon with a bit of trepidation. I had read some of the reviews and they seemed to be a little like \\""Buyer Beware\\"". I have had excellent results with the majority of my Amazon purchases, though, so I decided to \\""Go for It\\"". I must say they have worked perfectly so far. Now keep in mind I only bought the 50 pack but I have used approx. 20, making discs with pictures and videos for family members with 0(ZERO) failures. I am perfectly pleased and thank all @ Amazon for this excellent product."
1152,5,"Well, i bought this receiver after testing a friend's DENON 2310ci with my 5.1 speaker setup. I can say that the Denon, has more features BUT NOT A BETTER SOUND. The sound quality of this Sony DN1000, is amazing if not better than other more expensive receivers. The GUI is pretty good, setup is very easy and it has all the more important things to configure and don't have tons of things to setup. I can´t say about the upconvertion feature, since all my sources are already 1080 HDMI.  If you are looking for a excelent sound quality, easy setup, wants to setup once and \\""forget\\"" the receiver, look for the more important features but not ALL the features, don't go for other than Sony - DN1000.  ps.: i replaced a old 5.1 Yamaha in a box, and compare this Sony with a Denon 2310ci in my house. Use a PS3, a Samsung DVD Player, Macrovision HD cable box and a Philips 42 LCD 120 Hz all connected with HDMI cables."
1153,1,"I bought this unit back in May 2009 to complement my Samsung LED television. I loved it. I thought the sound was great and the streaming features (Netflix and Pandora) were awesome. I could even do picture slide shows from my computer via wireless. However, when my system was prompted to do a system firmware update on September 30, 2009, it crashed the system rendering it unusable (aka \\""bricked\\""). I called Samsung tech support and they seemed like this was a first when I had already done a search online and found that there were quite a few people with these units that had the same thing happen to them. I shipped just the unit (I was told not to ship the speakers, etc.) to a repair facility in Los Angeles (I'm in Northern California). I called two weeks later since they gave me a \\""7-14 business days\\"" estimate and they said that I needed to get approved for a replacement (which oddly enough took about a week). This meant that I had to ship the remaining components (speakers, remote, etc.) to New Jersey and wait another \\""7-14 business days\\"" by their estimates. I called again the day before Thanksgiving and they said it's waiting somewhere to be shipped back to me which could take another \\""7-14 business days\\"" by their estimates. It's December 8, 2009 and now I'm told that they don't have any replacements available until December 13th. I was planning on buying Blu-Ray DVDs this Christmas, but what's the point because \\""7-14 business days\\"" from whenever Samsung gets my replacement unit will be well into January.     DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT!!! I wouldn't buy anything from Samsung after my ordeal and if you do a search for this unit along with \\""firmware update\\"", you'll come across hundreds and hundreds of stories very similar to mine. I've heard that this hasn't happen to everyone, but it's obvious that there is a very high failure rate with this unit. This problem began with the firmware update on September 30, 2009 so any review before that date that is positive -- disregardthem because it's likely that those folks have now run into this problem. As of this writing, the two most recent firmware updates have caused a lot of these units to \\""brick\\"". Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere even if you have to spend a few more dollars."
1154,5,"I love this contemporary looking CD/MP3 player. After I bought it, I don't use my IPod touch any more. This player does all the jobs perfectly. The sound quality is surprisingly good. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves music."
1155,4,This product I am happy and satisfied with the purchase price that you have are very good and useful
1156,5,This iPod was just what I needed for my wife's long runs.  Came complete and ready for action!
1157,5,Product was easy to set-up with very good directions. Sound is very good especially for movies that support the 7.1. The Blu Ray player is very nice and overall for the money spent I am pleased with my purchase. Of course if you are looking for top of the line sound quality I would look at Bose if you have the cash.
1158,4,Couldn't ask for better cables for under 5 bucks. No problems to speak of. They are comparable to all the other cables that are 10x the cost.
1159,5,"The best headphones for the money.  For 14.95 these headphones are easily the best buy.  Great sound quality, more comfortable than any other in the ear headphones i have tried.  I would pay 40.00 for these.  Way better than phillips headphones.  I have 2 pair of phillips headphones and both were more expensive, less comfortable and the sound quality was far inferior."
1160,5,I've started running long distance pretty seriously in the last few months and these headphones work great when listening to music. I've gone through about 6 different headphones in as many months and these are the lightest I've ever had and don't slip at all due to sweat or movment.
1161,5,I am quite pleased with the quality and recording with these needles. They are easy to install and very favorable to work with.
1162,4,"I bought these based on a recommendation from a friend and the favorable reviews already written. The sound is way better than any other ear buds I've used. Granted I haven't used a lot of others but they're way more comfortable than your typical iPod buds and the sound quality is awesome for such a small little speaker. I use them with my cell phone (Google G1 - with adapter) when traveling and they've replaced more expensive full headphones when sitting at my desk at work. First they don't mess up my hair at work, they're a much lower profile than monstrosity's sitting on my head and likewise they're way better than my more expensive headphones for canceling out the noise of coworkers. My only negative on these is that I wish the chord was a little longer. Other than that I'll definitely recommend these to others."
1163,1,"Don't get me wrong this is a nice sounding speaker.  But the failure rate on these things right out of the warranty is pretty crazy.  You can find numerous threads about this with a quick search of Google.    I had my Infinity PS12 for about 3yrs and 1 month.  I started having a problem with the built-in amplifier cutting on and off during very normal play at any volume level.  The speaker would make loud popping sounds as the amp turned on and off.  I called Infinity about the issue and they said because it is 1 month out of warranty they won't cover it.  I wasn't expecting it to be fixed under warranty, but I was expecting they would be able to fix it.   I asked if I could just buy a replacement amplifier and guess what they don't make any parts for the Subwoofer anymore.  No way to repair it at all.  I even called a few \\""Authorized Infinity\\"" repair shops and they said they can't repair it.  Same exact story, no parts available for that model anymore.   Completely crazy that I basically have to throw this in the trash.    The damn thing was only 3 years old and Infinity drops all support for it.  This is a company I will not be buying from again."
1164,1,"Seemed like a great buy at first, worked well with my iPhone 3G and older generation iPod, but after 3 months it stopped working altogether."
1165,5,"After upgrading my Mac Mini to an Intel T7600 and applying Arctic Silver 5, my processor's average temperature dropped from 170 degrees F to 140. Make sure to use only enough to lay a light film over the CPU. One tube seems to have enough paste to cover dozens of CPUs. ArctiClean easily removed the old paste and smells nice!"
1166,5,After a few days of playing with the position of my rooftop antenna I was just about to give up when my internet research said a pre-amp could help. I got this one and went from five channels with a signal strength  of 60 to thirty six channels with a signal strength of 80+. I live about 60 miles from New York City and have a large mountain and plenty of trees between me and it. The setup was very easy and I like the idea of the power source for the amp being located inside the house and supplies power via the same single cable I have coming from the antenna. Even my FM reception improved dramatically.
1167,1,I selected this item based on the ear pieces.  I was surprised to find that they did not send what they advertised.  Rather they sent the cheaper version ear pieces with no explanation.
1168,1,Coby MP835   Less than six months and the screen goes black forever! Coby says it must be a defective unit and they will sell me another for a discounted price. Since the warranty is only 90 days no replacement! Amazon says they'll give me 50% of my cost back... We used to be fans of Coby however my Christmas gift that so thrilled my sweetheart is now a lump of black useless plastic... We won't ever buy Coby again!
1169,1,I hate this earphones.  You have to stick them so far in your ears that you feel as though you are attaching them to your brain to hear anything.  I am not sure why they got such good reviews.  They feel cheap.  The vendor did ship them quickly and professionally.
1170,5,"I bought these after reading everything I could on new ear buds to replace my terrible ipod ear phones that came with my shuttle.  I was having problems with my office-mate being able to hear my music, even when I could barely hear it.  I bought these ear buds and they worked fantastically!  My office-mate couldn't hear anything I played, even at volumes that blew out my ears, nor could I hear him, which helps because he plays music without ear phones.    The rubber ear covers are great because they are attached in a way that I can shove them into my pocket and they don't just fly off when I rip them out real quick when I'm walking or at the gym.   I like the length of the cord, as well as the color, and they have been my saving grace in the gym when I want to block out the screeching of the other machines and the weights getting clanked together. Love them!"
1171,5,"[[ASIN:B001F7AHXM Apple iPod classic 120 GB Black (6th Generation)]] is very easy to use. The control wheel is very easy to handle, and so I can select options very comfortably."
1172,5,"Denon fs3 soundbar exceeded my expectations. Great bass, and the sounds come out truly natural. This is money well-spent, and is recommended as a must-have for home theatre set-ups especially for anyone with a limited room area. A 5 to 1 audio experience in a compact-sized surround sound.  Thanks Amazon. Delivery was fast and secure. Received the item in excellent condition, and came with the accessories as advertised. I will continue doing more business with this outfit.  A limitation to this product is the non-HDMI cable connectivity. But nonetheless, it's just a minor inadequacy. (for me!) Also, ipod dock (asd 1r) has to be purchased separately."
1173,5,"Well it's basically as pictured... a bit bigger in real life than you'd expect. Mine however, came colored black when I'm pretty sure the \\""WHT\\"" part of the title means white. Doesn't matter tho, I'm not an iPod owner, black goes with my Zune just fine."
1174,4,"I am using these on the Monster Turbines and Sony MDR-EX85.  They isolate very well and are very comfortable but do tend to roll off the high-end just a little bit on the Monster Turbine.  This is a worthwhile trade off if like me you commute on the subway.<br /><br />At $5 per pair, they are a little pricey for the month or so that each pair normally last but I guess that is the price you pay to silence a crowded noisy train.  I have also used they while flying and they really shined at blocking out engine noise.<br /><br />I have used the T-100 tips on Etymotic ER6I and Altec IM716 and really like them."
1175,5,"Excellent,  Once you travel with these headphones you will never travel without them again."
1176,5,"I am very impressed with the quality of the system. I have tried playing CDs and MP3 disks and it works very well. The first player amazon.com shipped had a mechanical fault, but amazon.com promptly replaced it."
1177,5,"Awesome to have 200 DVDs stored in 2 albums instead of endless shelves and stacks.  Threw away all of the cases 2 years ago and never missed them.  If you have doubts, put the cases in your attic or basement and see a couple of years later they'll still be there.  I use another Case Logic album in the workout room for all of the workout, yoga, etc DVDs."
1178,5,Cable was delivered as promised packaged in the original Monster display packaging you would see in an electronics store.  High quality ends and the cable itself has a rugged fabric (Kevlar?) covering.  Plugs in with a firm connection and works perfectly.
1179,2,"I've had the blue and yellow version of these things for several years and was annoyed with them the entire time.  Because I didn't use them very often, however (maybe because they were so annoying ... chicken and egg), I put off searching for a replacement.        My chief complaint is that they were really uncomfortable for me.  The foam did not provide a secure fit, and I always felt like they were on the verge of falling out (which they often did).  If they did manage to stay, in they made my ears sore and the sound volume was very poor (probably due to the bad fit).      There are definitely better products out there in the under $20 range (like the Panasonic HJE300's I ultimately bought to replace the PLUGs).  I suggest shopping around."
1180,5,"Like many, I've invested not just money but time on research and experimentation in my quest for good sound. The thing is, I'm an apartment kind of guy, so most of my efforts pay off only in short bursts when I know that the neighbors are away. This is where a great set of cans easily become the most cost-effective piece of gear in your arsenal.     Here's what I got for $57 at Amazon (undetectably used): An expansive, 'airy,' 'open' soundstage, dead-accurate mids, competent and not boomy bass, and non-fatiguing highs. Most headphones in this price range are going to artificially boost the lows - generally mid-bass- in an attempt to woo first-time listeners into a sense of quality. Unlike having a bad hair day, when self-styled audiophiles refer to a particular unit as 'flat,' it's a compliment. And the SR60 are fairly neutral across the board, allowing the listener to truly experience what the artist or engineer intended. But enough about that.  EDIT, JULY '09 - I switched sound cards and now notice that the Grados are a bit 'bright.' Still not fatiguing, but definitely worth mentioning. I thought that perhaps it was the card, but I took them over to friends' houses and tried their rigs, it turns out that my old card was just a bit lifeless in the highs.(END EDIT)     By far, the thing that impressed me the most about the SR60 is the sheer openness of the sound. If you close your eyes, it's as though you're in a room with a nicer set of loudspeakers. Instruments are clearly defined, and vocals...wow, the vocals...they are sailing around your head. If you don't immediately notice this upon giving the Grados a listen, try comparing them to whatever earbuds you have lying around the house. It's no contest. Even my Shure buds don't hold a candle to the SR's in terms of fidelity and soundstage.    This is owing primarily to the open ear design. As you've read, this makes them a less than ideal solution for portables, as they'll bleed your Menudo songs all over the train. Definitely don't want that. Also, they aren't exactly portable (though they do pack in a suitcase nicely due to the rotating cups). That said, get a nicer set of earbuds if you are looking merely to upgrade the garbage that was bundled with your mp3 player.      But back to the sound. I cannot express how lifelike these cans are. When a triangle ring, fret slip, or even the parting lips of a vocalist about to sing pass through my ears, I feel as though I could just sell all of my non-headphone gear. And I would, if it weren't for watching movies and listening to music while away from the computer. that's how good the Grados are, and that's what I meant by it being the single greatest and most cost-effective investment you can make in your audio.      Seriously, they're $70. If you don't like them, sell them on eBay for maybe $8 less than you paid for them, as they're in demand.      One final word - do not be deterred by the weird packaging, Dr. Strangelove appearance, or other aesthetic intimations of 'cheap'(even the website). Make no mistake. You can't listen to slick packaging and you can't see the cans when they're on your head. These are THE best sounding headphones available at this price point, and hold their own admirably against more upper echelon products, including some of Grado's own products I have auditioned.        Addendum: Had to come back to let you know that I just ripped these phones off my head, thinking that I had accidentally pulled them from the source, and that the sound was blaring in my apt. at 1AM. That's how 'immersed' I got in one particular song. Simply cannot recall ever being so 'in the mix' with any other can...and I've used a few. That's it. If I keep coming back to gush, I'm gonna ask Grado to start paying me."
1181,3,"I've been looking for a nice, stylish pair of cans that I can use with my MP3 player for some time now.  The way I saw it, I wanted nice sound quality from a pair of around-ear headphones that didn't look like an industrial, symbiotic growth, and the playful color and pleasing visual aesthetic of these headphones seemed to fit that description.    After reading many reviews, I felt that the general opinion was mixed, but overall somewhat favorable, and I saw no better way to decide for myself than to buy them and try them.    That being said, I purchased them for almost $60 at a local Target store, hoping that they might live up to the reviews I've read.    But to be honest, I'm not planning to keep them.    I felt that the mids were too high, and the bass was somewhat loose. The sound was muddy when my MP3 player's EQ was set to flat. Surprisingly, out of all the EQ presets on my player, the one that sounded best through these headphones was \\""Pop,\\"" which I found surprising, since usually that EQ sounds miserable on other headphones.  Basically, I had to tweak the EQ a bunch in order to get these headphones to a point where I was happy with the sound.     I turned up the bass frequencies a bit, turned the mid frequencies way down (-6 or -7), and turned the treble frequencies up.  I will be quick to say that it sounded great after that, but I don't want to pay $60 dollars for a pair of headphones that I have to tweak that much.    Also, I've read that the headphones sit funny against some peoples' jaws. This was true for me, I found it somewhat uncomfortable, and it would definitely take some getting used to.    Bottom line: If you have to pay $60 dollars for them, don't buy these. Look elsewhere for another product.  If you pay $20 dollars for them, and they don't irritate your jaw, they're simply an attractive pair of decent headphones.    These are certainly not high end by any means, and don't expect a whole lot from them.    Hope that helps.  And for those thatwere curious, the current MP3 player I tried these with was a Sansa e280.    ~b"
1182,2,"These are the fourth pair of ear buds I've owned (Shure E2c and E3c, SkullCandy INK'd). Based on the relatively good reviews on Amazon, I thought I'd try a pair after loosing my pricy E3cs.  Maybe my expectations are too high, but I found the sound on these to be muddled, undefined and definitely disappointing.  No amount of `burn-in' has helped. They actually sound markedly worse than my $20 bass-heavy SkullCandies. I also couldn't find a comfortable fit with any of the adaptors, which makes them uncomfortable to wear, results in poor noise isolation, and is probably negatively affecting the sound quality (although I think the sound would be mediocre at best even with a good fit).  Build quality seems decent.  Overall, I've found them to be nowhere near as good as the hype, and not even a decent value at Amazon's price. They've been relegated to my gym bag for TV watching on the treadmill."
1183,2,"Why is it so hard to find a good nose trimmer??  about ten years ago I bought an excellent Panasonic brand trimmer-- a model they apparently no longer make- -but lost it a few years back. I bought this one thinking it would be comparable.  Wow, was I wrong.  not only did it not trim very effectively, it broke after only a few months.  it's not worth the hassle of sending it back in for repair.  steer clear of this one."
1184,5,"I received one for Christmas this year, and I'm favorably impressed. It's small enough to fit in a field jacket pocket, yet retains functionality. I went on a lot of disaster recovery teams, so I'm always looking out for good, compact field gear. One aspect that never changes is smaller is better, all other factors equal. Another point is replaceability. If it goes in the field, there's a fair chance it won't come home with you. Low cost and ease of replacement is a major plus with gear selection. Well worth the money if all the features function properly.    Being a recalcitrant engineer, I took it apart and tested the power components.    Radio  Works nicely. I come from the old AM radio & sideband days, so I'm not picky about sound quality. The AM & FM tuner movement needs gear reduction, badly. While tuning, I always overshoot the station, and tune over it back & forth until I get a feel for the station's location. This amount of knob movement is barely perceptible. Also, the tuning scale is analog and short. That means it gives an approximate idea of where you're tuning, not a direct input like today's digital tuning displays. A plus is the radio has a tuner pilot lamp, alerting you that you're parked right on the station. NOTE: like most consumer AM radios today, the AM radio uses an internal ferrite rod antenna, so it won't work as well inside cars and metal structures. AM radios \\""fade\\"" more than FM radios due to the longer wavelength, so make sure the radio's in a clear open spot for best AM radio reception. The external stalk antenna is for broadcast FM (88-108 MHz) and possibly weather radio (162 MHz). This should be fully extended, and temporarily adding a few feet of scrap wire might improve it more if need be.    Power management  To simulate a dead or inoperative battery, I removed the battery and tried to operate the radio. The generator easily powers the radio with plenty of power left over, almost overpowered (this is *not* a problem). The generatorhas a large power surplus relative to the radio, it continued to play until I almost stopped cranking. It seems like the generator was almost loafing around, like it didn't even see the radio. Sort of analogous to taking an eighteen wheel tractor-trailer to the store to buy milk and bread for the weekend.  Even cranking *very* slowly was enough to completely power the radio direct off the generator. Again, a plus for the generator. The explanation for this became apparent when I tested the generator.    Generator  The generator is power in, power out format. It does not store mechanical energy, so unlike the Bayliss generator models (AKA \\""Freeplay\\"") when you stop cranking, it stops producing power. Power output jack is a standard 3/32\\"" monaural jack (meaning not stereo, AKA \\""mono\\""), and since we replace cell phones often I didn't bother ordering the cell phone adapter Eton offers. Another factor is cell phone networks. Some networks have battery backup in their cell sites, others have dedicated generator sets. Cell site batteries typically last 4-8 hours and generators run out of fuel in about a day. In a major disaster, by day 2 the cell phone will be a moot point, and you'll be wishing you hadn't thrown that old citizens band transceiver out about 15 years ago. This is exactly what happened when we were in New Orleans, Aug-Sept 2005.    I made my own power adapter with a radio shack 3/32\\"" mono plug, wire and a couple of alligator clips. With this, I can power or charge anything that runs off of low voltage.     Another plus I discovered is the generator is self-rectifying. This means it produces the same polarity irrespective of the direction we crank the handle. This prevents us from accidently reverse-charging batteries when we think we're charging them. Reverse charging nickel metal hydride batteries often destroys them. I was blown away by the generator performance, and I'm amazed no one else commented on this. I didn't believe the initial readings at first,so I used another meter. For those of you familiar with the load line concept, my example produced about 5.25 volts open circuit and 500 milliamps (one half ampere) shorted. NOTE: I do *not* recommend cranking the generator shorted for any length of time! The theoretical peak power point is somewhere around 690 milliwatts at 2.6v @ 0.26 amps. It will make short work of charging batteries with terminals voltages under 3-4 volts. I made a quick Excel chart of the load curve, email me at richardavis2000@yahoo.com if you're interested in a copy.    Solar Cell  The solar cell is best suited for trickle charging the battery, with an emphasis on the term \\""trickle\\"". The cell requires ideal conditions to power the radio. In direct sunlight exposure (about noontime, 40 degrees latitude, mid-January) it will power the radio but output isn't adequate if it's behind glass. Behind glass, the solar cell output hovers right on the lower limit of the radio minimum operating voltage. This means if your battery wears out, you'll be using the generator indoors or the solar cell outdoors in *full* sunlight. The radio case has a clear panel over the solar cell, apparently to protect it, yet allows sunlight in. This is a drawback from my experiences with solar cells. When sunlight passes through a transparent medium, it loses some energy as the medium acts as a filter. In this application, the solar cell can't afford to have its output attenuated. In the future I will look into replacing this with a hinged cover. To use the cell, the cover is opened giving the cell better exposure to sunlight. On the plus side, the cell charges even if not in direct sunlight, and it has an LED to report current flow. Nice touch. I would have preferred a bigger solar cell, as the existing cell barely has enough power to run the radio by itself in direct sunlight.     Battery  The battery is a 3.6v rechargeable nickel hydride (NiMH) battery, an obvious weakness. At least it's a nickel hydride battery, making it resistant to forming a memory from partial discharges. They appear to be roughly 2/3 the height of regular AAA batteries, and sealed in green shrink-wrap. As another reviewer pointed out it would have been a nice addition to have a AAA battery solution as an alternative. The battery appears to be available from battery supply houses, a google search for 3.6v NiMH battery 3x1 2/3aaa turned up numerous online sources. This radio is very similar to the Freeplay Companion, so it may be possible to use the Freeplay Companion USB wall charger when purchased separately (about $12). It appears the radio charges externally through the USB port, even if from an AC source. So, it should charge equally well from a computer.    It charges easily through a USB cable, I bought a cheap self-retracting USB cable at the local dollar store that serves this purpose with a very small footprint. Obviously this implies a powered computer will be frequently available, which would be unlikely in a severe disaster. This hints that the person that designed this probably hasn't been through a long-term outage a la Katrina style. For chronic outages, we have a few large output solar cells that produce 10-15 watts each. The best measure is having a propane, gasoline or diesel standby generator and lots of fuel.    Notes, Observations, Miscellany:  * If you're planning on using this radio in a serious disaster environment, make sure the battery is in good shape, and replace the battery when the performance drops off.  Don't wait until it goes dead. This means you'll need to inspect your emergency gear regularly, which you should be doing anyway.    * Have several different types of radios, since they'll have different features that will extend your operating capabilities. This will also give you redundancy in case one radio drops offline. Same with other critical gear (flashlights, power, fire starting, what have you). Remember, if it's critical, it should also be redundant.    * Remember, this radio only receives. You can't call for help with it. To call out without cell phone or landline telephone service, you'll need a radio transceiver. The two most common examples of this are family radio service (FRS) and citizens band (CB).    * If you're in a mobile deployment team, this radio will require packaging in a hard sided waterproof container with protective padding. It won't take much in the way of rough handling.    Good:  * Multiple power sources reduces dependency on external power  * Small footprint, light, very portable.  * Flashlight works well. Light emitting diode lamps will last much longer than incandescent lamps  * Generator provides plenty of power, self-rectifying and uses an industry-standard connector  * Radio works well on all bands as advertised.    Bad:  * Small tuner knob requires patience. Easy to overshoot station during tuning. One half turn of the tuning knob spans the entire tuning range!  * AM station drifts...a lot. It requires frequent retuning.  * Too finely finished. My radio will get quite a few field scuffs.  * Solar cell has mediocre performance, and a transparent cover that attenuates already marginal performance  * A lot of water entry points that could have been prevented in the design phase.  * No means of accepting common consumer batteries (size AAA, AA, etc).  * USB charging port is nice, but unrealistic for chronic outages.    Improvements I'd like to see:  * Extended AM frequency range, into shortwave and single sideband. See my review on the Sony ICF-SW07 for more info on this type of radio.  * Gear reduction or other step-down on the tuning dial  * Digital LCD frequency display.  * Switch the location of the solar cell and the crank handle. This would put the crank handle on the top, allowing the user to crank with the radio standing upright on a table. It would also allow a larger solar cell on the side, or better yet a detachable solar cell that snaps on & off with lead wires. And a larger solar cell, substantially higher output cell, or better yet, both.  * Hinged protective cover over solar cell if left in it's present location (on top of the radio).  * Commercial battery option, even if the battery holder is external. Maybe I'll make one...hmmm.  * Bayliss generator option (wind-up clockwork style)  * Better water resistance. Making the case from clear plastic would eliminate the need for a separate cover over the solar cell. Using a ceramic piezoelectric speaker element glued to the inside of the case would make the case a functional speaker without the need for speaker holes. These two modifications would reduce several water entry points."
1185,5,"I love this remote. It was very easy to set up. It replaced all my other remotes. My wife only had to learn one new set of buttons after I set up our new entertainment system. I was skeptical at first due to some of the reviews I had read, but I haven't had any problems. The charger works fine. I've never had to reboot it and programming equipment it doesn't know is a snap with the \\""learn\\"" feature. It comes with very intuitive software that seems to anticipate any problems you might have with set up. I caught it on sale before Christmas for around $75.00 and it's about the best $75.00 I've spent. We couldn't be happier."
1186,4,"I bought it, Just hooked everything up, works fine. It does not come with the optional adapter, as far as I can tell the adapter is necessary if you want to utilize the remote control? I'm really not certain what the power is needed for to be honest, the intelligent switching function works pretty good though. I have my pc connected to my hdtv and when i turn on my ps3 it automatically switches the channel over, nice! I like it, worth the low price for sure."
1187,5,"It was a gift for my wife - she is into esoteric music and \\""recorded books\\"". Our local library is getting it's iPod titles up to date and the selection will be good. (most libraries have good MP3 book selections - iPod is later to the game - but coming on. Once you've downloaded the right app to your Mac or PC from the Apple site you are ready to go - very easy to download music, etc. Get one! Amazon's price and service were tops."
1188,5,"I ordered this product for my mother, and she loved it. She wanted a good set of speakers and docking station for her zune, so this was perfect. It has great speakers."
1189,4,"For the price, these inexpensive speakers sound pretty good. I'd purchased a similar looking 4 driver model from another brand that sounds a little bit better and cost more, but these are OK with clean vocals and decent bass and are loud enough to be heard across the room.The volume control which is not on many other models is helpful. There is not an AC cord, only a USB connection for non-battery use. The bright blue LED reminds you when it's powered."
1190,1,Ordered through Pepsi Stuff promotion. The headphones arrived defective/damaged. One side wire was broken. Guess what? No returns or exchanges on Pepsi Stuff prizes. Seems like this is a scam to give away damaged merchandise. I read the Pepsi t-shirt reviews and apparently they suck. way too small.
1191,3,"Works fine but when I took it out of the box the front was dented, I guess because it is rather heavy someone dropped it and therefore its easy to cause damage."
1192,5,"I have experience with the Sansa e200 series, ipod Nano,, ipod classic, Sansa Clip, and the iRiver H20, and I can say that this is hands down the best MP3 player I've used yet.    It's lightweight and small, but with a large, colorful screen.  It has excellent battery life, custom backgrounds, memory card support, and easy to use software to convert video files to the proper format.    The button placement may be a little awkward at first, but it is not hard to get used to.  The best thing is the ability to search by letter: when you browse media (especially artists if you have a lot of music on it), you can press the 'right' directional button and move to a list of the letters in the alphabet.  As you scroll from 'A' to 'B' and so on, it will move to the artists whose names start with those respective letters, and with a simple press of the 'left' directional button, you can browse through each artist again.    All in all, an excellent alternative to the ipod."
1193,4,"The first time I saw this product in my friend's house, I was impressed by the looks and the sound quality. I immediately ordered for it in Amazon. I have been using this for last couple of months and it works great. The sound quality, although not as good as Bose systems, but good enough to feel the music. The price is quite cheaper than Bose too. The only thing missing is an Alarm clock, otherwise the product is very good."
1194,5,"Honestly I cant believe I didn't get one sooner. This seriously has made my life easier. Not only organizing me, but putting everything into one. Now I got to upgrade to an IPhone to be ALL in one!  The only difference between this and the Iphone is one has the ability to talk on the phone with \\""phone features.\\"" and the ITouch does not have any of that...     But if you do not need a cellphone then the Itouch is the way to go."
1195,5,"These blow away the standard ipod earbuds (which ones don't?).  One pair of the three different sized sets of included plugs should fit 98% of people out there.    These are close to \\""noise cancelling\\"" buds since they seal so well and basically block out external ambient sound - assuming you are playing something on the ipod of course.    Oh, and the bass?  The bass is not just a marketing gimmick or a bunch of BS - these things really do have superb and deep bass.  Listening to Peter Gabriel's Red Rain from Secret World Live, I can feel the drums pounding and its awesome.    Worth every penny - I bought 2 pairs."
1196,4,I bought a 765i unit Oct 2008 - mine did not work with the latest (4th) generation iPod Nano (Cambridge unit ordered Oct 2008) - but does work with 3rd generation - so I kept it - was good enough - (so also question if will work with iPod Classic 120 GB (contemporary released with 4th generation nano)) - so if you need that (4th generation) functionality specifically ask about it.<br /><br />later addition - I found out this unit does work with the iPod Classic series - but maybe not iPhones.
1197,1,Failure rate about 90% on my Compaq Desktop.  Almost all fail at 2nd layer.  DVD burner worked fine with Dynex DVD DL.
1198,1,"I had this product about 3 weeks. After the initial charging, I plugged the bluetooth in using the charger supplied. The unit started to smell like burning plastic, then began to smoke. I must admit that the store (Buynow) was very helpful in returning this unit and refunding my money, but the product itself was a disappointment."
1199,2,"Couldn't be happier with it until it no longer worked (6 months).  The internal battery wouldn't hold a charge anymore, and since it's internal you can not replace it.      Trying to get another one under the warranty, but i'm getting the run around and havn't been succesful yet. Search the dead battery on the clip, there are more of us.    Great purchase if you plan on 6 months worth of useage."

1201,5,"I ordered this for a friend even after viewing all the bad reviews but the Phillips Magnavox Mant-910 that I have is so hard to find. So I ordered this anyways since the price was right and thinking if it was as half as good as the Phillips it should work for him. And WOW! It is so great it pulls in even a couple of very distant stations. And yes you will need to turn off the dish reciever \\""ONLY\\"" if you are using the antenna coax in on your tv for your dish reciever hook up, If you are using the audio,video input on the tv for your dish reciever hook up and the antenna in coax on your tv for your over air channels then you can leave the dish on and still receive the over air stations with out any problems. This Terk TV-42 Antenna is great just mount to your dish and it will work Great. This thing is for sure 5 stars for all around performance and price."
1202,3,"I bought this because it was featured on Good Morning America.  Gotta trust Sam Champion!      The first radio had a broken solar panel when received.  Communication with Amazon.com, returning the broken radio and obtaining the replacement was fast and easy.       The radio sounds just fine and the features seem to work.    I think the instruction booklet is hard to use because of the size of the illustrations and some of the explanations are minimal.     I am trying to determine if the solar panel is actually charging the ni-cad battery.  There is an indicator light, but it does not seem to change. I have not yet used the toll free number.  That will be my next step."
1203,1,"These headphones are horrible and poor quality. I have only had mine for 3 months, and they are already broken. I get no sound out of the left ear now. The cord is so long that it is simply impossible for it not to get tangled or become a nuisance. I had gotten these headphones precisely because the ones that came with my ipod were not working well and the left ear plug produced no sound. Now, I have the same problem with these.    By contrast, I got my wife the Coby CVE92 Isolation Stereo Earphones, which is cheaper, has better sound, and still works."
1204,5,"The remote works exactly as promised and is just as easy to program.  I have not found another all-n-one remote that would work with our Olevia tv and I was hesistant.  But now that I have it, it was well worth the money.  It is so easy my 7 year old can use it."
1205,4,"The Polk CSi3 Center Channel has definitely enhanced the audio experience.  I had previously installed the Polk 8\\"" ceiling speakers for the front and back channels and this filled in the frontal gap with a touch more base than previously available.  I have a sub-woofer to purchase sometime in the near future which should compete the system.  I did have to return one of the ceiling speakers for repair without any hassle.  Overall, the shopping experience, service and quality of sound is [[ASIN:B0000E6S12 Polk Audio CSi3 Center Channel Speaker (Single, Black)]]very satisfying."
1206,5,"It's everything you could hope for at this price.  Good sound, solid receiver, and all wires included.  I would recommend upgrading your cables (it comes with very basic stuff), but there should plenty of money left over to do that.  The only thing it's missing is audio support through HDMI (it's video passthrough only), but you have to pay as much for a receiver as I did for this whole system to get that.  Overall, you can't beat the value."
1207,5,"I love this little player! It's really lightweight and incredibly small, but the sound is really good.  I'm impressed with how well it has worked out. For the money, the value can't be beat."
1208,5,Since boombox are becoming less common and Mp3 player's taking over the market...I don't know why company won't put out a product that can play your mp3 music out loud?  They don't expect us to use our headphones all the time?    This is a great gadget...small enough to take everywhere and the sounds is really good for such a small device.
1209,5,"I Love, Love,Love it. Anyone could set it up. Sound is great. Radio picks up everything.Mic works well.Its Fun! Everyone asks about it and wants to check it out. I got cover w/ clip. So you can put it anyplace. GREAT ITEM!"
1210,5,"I use the cable to connect my Sony Vaio Laptop (S-video + Audio) to my TV (3-RCA).  The laptop handles the conversion of the signal to the TV.  When viewing the computer screen on the TV the resolution could be better, but that's a limitation of the TV.  When I view video-quality downloads or stream live TV stations online I cannot tell the difference, the resolution is indiscernable.  Others have written negative comments probably because their computer is incompatible or the recieving TV is incompatible.  I strongly recommend checking both to make sure the female ends of the cable are compatible.  You can also Google \\""S-Video\\"" and find many pictures online to double check before being a dissatisfied buyer."
1211,4,I have just bought a few IPODs for me and my family. It was easy to do it. No complain.
1212,4,"It is quite sturdy. Cards are easy to insert and remove, and the labels on the cards are not obscured in any way by the case, as with some other wallets.     I'm a little concerned about pressure on the tiny slide that locks the card. One of mine just broke off, but I don't know if this case had anything to do with that. It could have just as easily happened with any other storage solution I've seen. I might just put a piece of cellophane tape over that side of the cards, keeping them permanently in read and write mode.    I bought this because recently I was shooting a wedding for friends, and just as the recessional started I needed to change cards in a hurry. The dang case the next card was in was so hard to open that I missed most of the recessional. I wish I had this case then; it would have solved that problem.    If I had been the designer I would have chosen a different color, but that's not important. This is the best solution I could find. The Targus aluminum clad case may be as good for a few dollars more, but I haven't handled one."
1213,5,"I'm using this with my 2nd generation Ipod Nano 2GB and it is awesome. The sound is great, the ability to hook it into a larger sound system is nice, and the remote control's ability to work every function is a big plus. My only regret is that I didn't buy two when they were on sale for $19.99!"
1214,2,The product is fine I guess but clearly the picture shows a handle which is why picked this particular case.      The products I received didn't have a handle attached or as an accessory in the box.
1215,4,"I haven't hung my yet, but have it flat in a drawer.  Works fine to keep batteries organized and I especially like the tester."
1216,5,The one I got is actually gold plated and works great. It's sturdy and feels well constructed.
1217,5,"After the Iphone this is the greatest Ipod device, it allows you to play video with a great resolution and in a fair size screen in comparison with the other Ipod's.    You will have fun using the internet browser as well as the direct access to youtube and itunes store.    I really recommend this item."

1219,3,"I have used it for simple classes (not music), the voice quality is good, but it press high on your ears and become annoying after a couple of hours.  Also the wire is not long enough."
1220,5,"A terrific product!  As I have a bunch of components all tied into my home theater receiver, this remote does a great job at adjusting all the inputs and settings for a particular activity (watch TV, play DVD, play iPod, etc).  With 3 young kids and a techonology-challenged wife, I don't think my family  would ever be able to watch TV without the Harmony Remote!!    While I actually find it fun to customize the remote online, I imagine the process can be a bit daunting, if not intimidating to those less technologically-inclined!    All in all, a great product that requires a fair amount of know-how to get it \\""just right\\""."
1221,5,"I got my iLuv dock yesterday and I was satisfied beyond my expectations, the quality of the sound is great, all the complementary features such as dual alarm - adjustable light dimmer - date of the day - etc. work smoothly.

(IE playstation3)     What i found when i went on line to buy a Boise, was that it wont work for what i want it to do. So then i researched more into wireless systems and seen that there is really no true wireless system, and if there is it wont do what i want it to do, and it will most likely come with a DVD player that is junk.    I want my DVD played to play divix svcd mp3s and wmv, and all that good stuff.     none of the ones they sell did, so i decided to go look for a DVD played that did. then find a stand alone audio system, and see what that would run me. this is the DVD played that i found.    [[ASIN:B000FE99JY Onkyo Single Disc Universal HDMI/RS232 player DVSP504S]]    so i thought i was goingto buy it, then i started researching into the receiver and stereo i would buy.    bottom line is , i found this 800 7.1 system to be the best bang for my buck and decided i could hook my ps3 computer and both my dvr and hd receiver to this receiver, and bump each one of those components with digital Dolby surround sound. I'M SOLD.    i can run my dvr, hd receiver DVD player computer all in one, and switch over to each of them with one push of the remote or receiver,    the back of the receiver is a dream come true, except putting the 40 Gage speaker wire in the receiver, that is hard  (IE: the small space it is hard to push wire through and tighten and loosen the screw),   but once it is done, then your good to go.      it has ports for everything, and the different audio selections are fun to play with to find the best sound for what you are watching, and believe me you browse through each one, it is not hard to find the one that stands out, its really amazing.    it has a Mic that you put wherever you are going to sit, then it runs test on each speaker, then it sets the sound to the ideal point, for your viewing.       if you turn it down low, the sub turns off (red light indicator), if you turn it up the sub turns on(green light) , it knows when to be on and off.    one thing that you do not have to worry about with this system at all is the quality of sound that the speakers produce,  it sounds great!, no doubt about it, it has crystal clear effects and booms.    i mounted the speakers with no speakers mounts, and did not even worry about facing them down, or how high they needed to be or how low, i just did them in the spots that work best for me and my family, and ran the wires through the attic so no one can see them and it worked great. i did not use the wires that came with the system, i used th 40 gage that people recommend in the reviews.     it took me one day to get it how i wanted, and since, then the receiver has not moved! it has not heated up, it can be on for hours with it full blast, it can stay on all night playing the radio and i don't think i will ever have to move it again, its perfect.    this system is great, and i plan on having it for many a years to come, also onkyo offers a phat warranty on the speakers and receiver!"

1225,4,"Speakers were slightly larger than the satellites I was replacing, but still compact.  These have a surprising amount of bass for a low-cost mini-speaker.  My receiver cross-over point is 100Hz and these have a low frequecy range of 150Hz, so I'm still missing a portion of the signal, but the overall listening experience is still pleasant with little distortion.

I can't even use it on the Windows machines at work because it requires the installation of software on any machine you want to use it as a storage device with.    After doing a bit of research on the 'net, I've come to learn that previous generations of this device (U1 and U2) as well as *every other* similar Samsung device had this functionality, with the exception of the U3. Some folks recommend downgrading the ROM to a UMS-compatible version (the ROM download is, in fact, available from Samsung's site) but it seems this particular device is 'smart' and does not allow itself to be modified for UMS functionality.    I'm sorry to have to rate this product 1 star --  but flash drive functionality was the only reason I bought a 2GB device instead of some other player/recorder/radio with less memory. It's actually pretty nice, and I own 2 iPod's and an iPhone. The FM radio sounds very good, and the voice recorder is also nice.* The UI is very clever and only a tad more complex to use than an iPod. All around, a nice, tiny, device. Oh, and you can even turn off the LED effects, since out of the box, the default behavior is to flash bright LEDs every time you press a button.    Anyways, with regards to flash drive functionality: Buyer beware!    *With regards the voice recorder, it picks up the noise of your hands when you handle the device. So if you hold it while recording, it will record every squeak and brush of your fingers as it rubs across the surface. Very annoying. Fortunately, it has a clip that will let you tuck the thing in your pocket. So long as you don't move much, you won't pick up the extra noise."
1229,1,The first one out of the pack was a coaster and will not play on either dvd player or on the dvd burner on my computer. Avoid this product.
1230,5,Very fast delivery. Once again the moral is: Don't pay extra for expedited shipping unless it's overnight.
1231,4,"Read this review, it might save you hours of grief.  Six months ago I set up my home theater in one long 24 hour day. For a nice clean look, I mounted a panny 50\\"" plasma on the wall and hid the components in an av closet.  The next day I began the setup of the 890.  Two frustrating days later I still couldn't get it to work right.  I eventually discovered that every time I picked up the remote and gave it a little shake to turn on the light, the battery momentarily disconnected.  I cut a piece of rubber band and stuck it behind the battery.  End of problem.  Haven't had a problem since.   Highly recommend this remote, just wish it had bigger volume and channel buttons."
1232,4,"As reviewer R L \\""A father in Pennsylvania\\"" pointed out, this is a great receiver, but Zone 2 is definitely flawed.  Not being able to play digital sources in Zone 2 is a big disappointment.  I didn't plan on using any analog sources till I discovered this.  Now for two sources, I have digital and analog going to the receiver, which just makes the mess of cables even worse.  If I knew about this beforehand, I wouldn't have purchased this receiver.  I guess it helps to read the small print.    My only other complaint is the lack of \\""pre-outs\\"" which is something most other brands in this price range come with."
1233,5,"This is one of the best investments I have made.  The remote even works with my Apple iMac computer.  One of my favorite features is the ability to assign the same function to multiple buttons on the remote.  Minus a small programing issue that proved to be operator error, the remote has been excellent.  On the programming note, Logitech customer service was very polite and courteous in pointing out my error!  I would recommend this to anyone who is tired of multiple remotes needed to work your entertainment center.  Buy through Amazon, they have the best prices by far and shipping time, on my order, was faster than expected!"
1234,5,"Before I purchased the Stiletto, I felt that I was not getting my money's worth from my Sirius subscription.  Now that I can listen to all of my favorite Sirius chanels through my wireless Internet connection, I am now enjoying Sirius like I should.  The design of the Stiletto SL100 is great.  It is small enough to fit into a pocket, or use a case and clip to your belt.  It came with both a slim battery and a longer life battery.  I found that I can listem to my Stiletto for at least three hours and still have 2 bars of charge left with the thicker battery.  The sound quality is great, and having 800MB of music storage is also a plus; it keeps me from having to bring my iPod on trips if I want to listen to my own music.  Overall, I am very pleased with my Stiletto SL100.  Good job."
1235,2,This was a great remote for about 12 months. Then the buttons used for the DVR stopped working. It was hard to fast forward and stop a recording and finally became almost impossible. Clearly this remote was not made to last.
1236,4,The system works great the only improvement I would make is to have a battery pack so I could take it to the beach.
1237,5,"I've flown about 70,000 miles with these headphones.  They definitely remove all of the plane engine noise, the sound of dull chatter, the sound of other people's music, the PA system admonishing people disobeying the \\""seat belt on\\"" light, etc.  They do not remove shrill high pitched sounds such as babies screaming nearby.<br /><br />I find the headphones comfortable and the battery seems to last me about 25,000 miles of flying.  The cord is retractable and the headphones sort of collapse into a smaller volume, but they do not fold, so they are a little bulky.  Also, the cord is too short for comfortable movement when I want to plug the headphones into my laptop at my desk.  For me, these are the only two downsides--Yes, the headphones do get painful after wearing them on a 6 hr flight, but I can't think of any other headphones I've used that were comfortable for 6 hrs straight.<br /><br />Given how cheap these are compared to the competition, they are definitely a worthy investment for the casual flier.  I find that I am far less tired when I wear these than when I fly without them (I cross the US 2-4 times a month).  I also use some other earbuds when I want to fly with minimal cargo, but these definitely block out noise far better than earbuds or other regular, non-noise canceling headphones."
1238,3,"I was very surprised at the noise canceling capability of these earphones. The big drawback is that there is no volume control on the earphones so you are dependent on the devices (or worse yet the airline seat control) for volume adjustment. My PDA/MP3 player's volume resolution is very poor so the sound is either too loud or too soft. However as strict noise canceling, at least in airplanes, they seem to work very well."
1239,2,"I bought this item because it features \\""smart-set\\"", which means that the clock radio automatic sets the time and date when plug in power. However after about a week, the radio decides to turn itself on. Even when I turned it off, it will turn itself on after some random intervals (30 sec - 5 minutes). So I will have to return this to Target."
1240,5,"I tried several different earphones before I purchased these. The other earphones were too large and made my ears hurt after using them for 30 minutes or so, and they frequently fell out. These earbuds fit comfortably in my ears, and I find the sound quality more than meets my needs since I use my iPod mainly for listening to audio books. I highly recommend these earbuds!!"
1241,1,"I agree with the two poor reviews above. I bought a bunch of these from Staples and have had nothing but problems. They are not compatiable with alot of players, and the ereeor rate is very high, not to mention that we they do work and you go back to them a few years later guess what you have, a disc that won't play."
1242,5,"I've owned this product for a couple months now, and only experienced a brief outage or two, but this battery backup has performed flawlessly.  The load for this unit is perfect for home use, but be aware that only 4 outlets are surge- AND battery-protected - - this is fine if you choose your components wisely (there's no reason to plug some items in to the battery-protected outlets).  The software is easily installed and can gracefully power down your PC during an extended outage. <br />So far this unit has out-performed the comparable APC unit that I also owned..."
1243,4,Product was everthing as advertised... I enjoy the full-featured portability remote control. I only wish the docking station could be made even smaller.
1244,1,"I purchased these earbuds, put them in my ears and immediately pulled them out and returned them.  They are very uncomfortable and hardly fit in my ears. <br /> <br />"
1245,1,"My daughter really loved getting this item for Christmas.  Unfortunately, the CD player is not reliable.  It freezes (sometimes for several hours), unfreezes unexpectedly (especially great in the middle of the night), skips repeatedly, or just plain refuses to start at all.  The only thing that works well is the radio.  We already have a radio, so the purchase was a big waste of money.  Terribly disappointing.  I strongly recommend that potential buyers look elsewhere."
1246,1,"I got two of these through Amazon.  One works most of the time, the other one does not.  I have the more expensive SanDisk 4G card that works flawlessly in both my computer and in my Nuvi. <br /> <br />What is odd is that the SD card that I received says \\""SecureDingital Card\\"".  It just surprises me that the stick on label on the card would misspell Digital and not use the standard SD logo.  This product came from eek Technology."
1247,5,Purchased two of these - one black and one white - for my kids.  They LOVE them - not necessarily the best or the cheapest but everything is geared to ipods these days and this makes it the personal audio gear that you just have to have.  My only complaint is the battery life - could hold it's charge longer....The new screen is substantially brighter which is great but if you leave it on for more than 1 second it burns up your battery life.....30GB is HUGE - 3000 songs and you still have 20GB left...
1248,4,"I recently got this one from t-Mobile(returning the Blackberry Pearl) and i am more than happy. Very sleak and easy to use. Motorola has indeed taken care of so many problems with the older RAZR phones. Now the battery lasts longer, phone charges faster, has a 1.3 MP camera(works okay) and a Micro SD card slot for all the music you want. <br /> <br />The bluetooth works like a charm( i am using a Plantronics 510 headset). Its missing some of the features that my Nokia 6600 has, but i am okay with without them.  <br /> <br />I would give it 5* but the user interface lets me down. For instance, to turn on Bluetooth, i have to navigate thru quite a lot. <br /> <br />Overall a good phone with decent features."
1249,5,"I have used the T.sonic 610 1GB MP3 Player for one week and so far I am<br /><br />very pleased.  It worked perfectly right out the box.  I connected it to my PC and it recogized it instantly.  It was very easy to drag drop my music into the player.  I created different folders on the player to organize different type s of music. I like being able to charge the battery on the usb port. The display is very bright , colorful and intuitive. The FM tuner is very strong and precise. The ear bud headphones are comformable and have good sound quality.  I recommend this to anyone looking for a good value MP3 player."
1250,1,"I bought this thing and it worked great for about three months. Yeah it sounds nice and all that but now it doesn't power up at all. I tried just the batteries-nothing. I tried the power cord-still nothing. I tried taking it back to Target, nothing. Altec Lansing Customer Service wasn't helpful. In the trash it went after I took a baseball bat to it. I need something that works and this did for awhile but it was manufactured horribly and is cheap plastic. I went with JBL and am very satisfied with that."
1251,1,"This thing loses the signal too easily.  Every time it loses the signal the receiver begins to beep loudly.  You will never get any uninterrupted sleep if you use this.  If you are expecting a baby, go ahead and plug this piece of junk in to give you practice waking up throughout the night.<br /><br />I have seen similar complaints in the reviews.  The signal loss is not due to distance.  As an experiment I placed the receiver and transmitter in the same room with no objects blocking it and with no other electronic equipment turned on.  It still chirped away with its maddening beeps.<br /><br />There has to be something better."
1252,3,"For the price, this unit is a pretty good deal.  It sounds great and seems to work OK.  The only \\""problem\\"" is in the function selection.  If you just want it to play back the music you stored, fine, but if you want to change the playback curve or have it repeat or do a random selection, it isn't the easiest thing in the world to finagle the button(s) to get where you want.  Just takes some patience and practice."
1253,2,"There DOES exist software that works with Windows XP (the 'MPman' MP-F30 music player is the same as the raveMP 2100, just relabeled). There is software for it here: [...]<br /><br />****<br /><br />Here's the download you need: [...]<br /><br />****<br /><br />Notes about using the program:<br /><br /> - You need to have your Parallel Port set to 'ECP'. You do this by going into the BIOS (the 'setup screen') when you're booting your computer. In there, poke around in the menus looking for something that mentions the 'parallel port'. When you find an option that looks promising, switch through the possible options until it says ECP. Enjoy.<br /><br /> - I've found that the MP3 player needs to be attached to the PC and already switched on BEFORE the MPman File Transfer software is started.<br /><br /> - Remember, the MP3 player is also able to record sound. There is a catch though: Windows doesn't recognize the type of WAV files the recorder produces. The solution: installing the following driver should fix that: [...]<br /><br /> - To \\""Initialize\\"" is just MPman's way of saying \\""Format\\"". To format means to wipe the MP3 player clean  --  usually a good solution if the MP3 player is acting quirky.<br /><br />Good luck!"
1254,5,"Picked up a pair at an airport because my apple ones were dying and I had to listen to my ipod for a plane ride, these earbuds did not disappoint, very comfortable and decent sound for the price it just can't be beat.  I've had my share of uncomfortable earbuds, but not these, I put them in and barely even felt they were there, my dog recently chewed them up so I'm going to get me another pair exactly like them.  Great product!"
1255,1,"I never learn...pay more for better quality... <br />I bought the GE recorder and as others have said, the sound is horrible, muffled and hissing.  So I paid $10 more for an external mic, with very little improvement. <br /> <br />So I bought the Sony recorder, for only $5 more than the GE!, and the sound is immensely better.  And the built-in mic on the Sony is even better than with an external mic. <br /> <br />Avoid the GE...pay only $5 more and get the Sony, which has automatic shutoff and a carrying handle, both which the GE doesn't."
1256,1,"I'm not sure what I expected after I purchased this for fifty some-odd dollars and was handed a coupon for a $40 rebate.  But I wish that someone had informed me before I lugged it all the way home that when you sing into the mic, your voice doesn't come through the speaker.  I'm cool with the machine's sound quality when it comes to playing a CD-G.  If I tap the mic, I can hear an extremely faint thud, so I know it's on, but the volume's too low--and, yes, I adjusted the mic controls--if you want to sing along. Which makes this a dinosaur: a boom box in the age of the iPod.   <br /> <br />Really had to dig through the stacks of machines to find a box that hadn't been opened.  So, when was my first clue?  Doh!"
1257,4,I Bought These For For work.For A side camera Pack With my I Pod.It Sounds Great.But Not to loud.Its Not A Boom Box!!! That with My Belkin Ipod case With The noose top Case.holds it Keeps It A Tight little System. This Site was Cheapest To Purchase Over Circiut city 9/05
1258,3,"well here is my take on it...doesnt' have the best sound quality but i bought it to use it for my workout so is great for it. if i want great sound then i'll just use my ipod. it's light and best of all it uses an external AAA battery. i have used the psyc for 16 hours now...battery level is still at the highest...what else can i say? if only ipod used AAA's. if you're looking for a 512MB player, you're probably looking for something that you can use for your jogging or some workout session...if not you should be looking for a hard drive player. it's 99 bucks too....how many other 512mb players do you get for 99? besides the ipod shuffle i don't see any...and it has a display too....anyway...if you're looking for great sound....go somewhere else, if you're looking to workout with it look no further. Oh and one more thing....this thing can get loud...seriously loud...with the volume level at half it's as loud and my ipod will ever get...just one more thing to consider."
1259,5,"Finally, an MP3 player that fits the \\""pocket\\"". The iPOD Shuffle weighs only 20 grams, costs only 149.00 USD (1 GB), plays great music and doubles up as a USB (2.0) storage device.  <br /> <br />Controls - Intuitive: <br />------------------- <br />Front:  <br />A circular control handles the Volume Up, Volume Down, Skip, Repeat. At the center is the Play/Pause button. All accessible at the touch of the thumb.  <br /> <br />Back:  <br />A sleek slider control for power off, play shuffle mode and play continuous mode, ensures that you don't accidentally switch the player on/off. Also at the back is the battery status button.  <br /> <br />Uploading Music - A breeze: <br />--------------------------- <br />Uploading songs to your iPOD Shuffle is a breeze with the bundled iTUNES, an award-winning digital-jukebox software.  <br /> <br />iTUNES:  <br /> <br />- Library, a great music organizer. Add songs individually or by the folder.  <br />- Drag and Drop the songs from your iTUNES Library into your iPOD Shuffle - that simple.  <br />- Search songs in Browse mode by Genre, Artist and Album. The quick search filters the song list as you type which is very fast and effective.  <br />- Import/Convert Audio CD into pristine-quality AAC file format.  <br />- Burn custom playlists to CDs and MP3 CDs.  <br />- Party Shuffle, which keeps a queue of songs at the ready that you can rearrange.  <br />- Radio, more than 250 free Internet radio stations.  <br />- Also nifty playlists being \\""My Top Rated\\"", \\""Recently Added\\"", \\""Recently Played\\"", \\""Top 25 Most Played\\"".  <br /> <br />Charging and Battery Life: <br />-------------------------- <br />Plug it into the computer USB port or alternatively via the iPOD Shuffle Battery back (sold separately) and you are ready for up to 12 hours of pure music.  <br /> <br />Headphones: <br />------------ <br />The signature white earbud headphones deliver a sharp sound quality.  <br /> <br />I was looking for a simple yet sleek, light, inexpensivemp3 player that plays good music and the iPOD Shuffle delivers just that. Not having an LCD screen on the iPOD Shuffle does not bother me a zilch. I have been using the iPOD Shuffle every single day since my purchase (well almost) and not once has it jumped a song.  <br /> <br />Simple is beautiful and Apple proved it once again."
1260,5,I RELLLY REALLY WANT A MINI IPOD!! GIMME GIMME GIMME!!!! WAHHH... POO ON ALL U PPL THAT THINK REGULAR IPODS R BTR!! MINI'S RULE!!! THEY R SMALLER AND COME IN DIFF COLORS!! BLUE IS THE PRETTIEST!!!! GET THE BLUE!!! I WANT ONE!!!! GIMME GIMME!! LALALALALALALALAL.. HA HA HA HA HA.. GET AN IPOD MINI!!!
1261,1,"There are few things worse than paying $300 for an MP3 player, spending more than an hour setting it up, and then finding out that the battery is no good (apparently a fairly common problem with the iPods).  Now I understand that many batterys go bad after one year of use - at $99 for a replacment battery, it looks like the total cost of the iPod will be well above the origional investment. <br /> <br />I definately regret chosing the iPod"
1262,1,"I bought this player about a month ago & it worked fine for about a week. Brand new CDs started skipping for no reason & at different times during repeated play. Many times it would just skip the first 40 seconds of a song then play normally. I returned it for a replacment.  <br /> A &quot;new&quot; one arrived & when I hooked it up it even refused to turn on at first. When I finally got it running it started acting possesed, for a minute I thought I was in Maximum Overdrive. It went into random disc mode for no reason, refused to play anything, & then finally shut down with a cryptic &quot;15&quot; the only thing shown on the display. Needless to say I am returning it as we speak, this time for a refund. Obviously JVC is seriously lacking in quality, perhaps this accounts for the low price. If you want to needlessly waste your time & money, buy this cd-changer. Otherwise look elsewhere."
1263,2,"The earphones sounded good in the ear, good bass/mid/treble, and they do block outside noise well.  The weird thing those is that they create noise because now you can hear your breathing, heartbeat and while running this is VERY annoying.  For light gym workouts they are ok, but not for heavy cardio.  I also felt that I had a real hard time running any distance and would constantly sweat while I had them in.  I talked to my running club about this, and they said it's probably because they are blocking your ear from regulating your internal body temp.  So basically my ear thinks it's like 110 degrees out, and kicks my body temp up as well.  All I know is that I could barly run a 10K with them in, and the next time I ran, I did the 10K training run, no problem at all.  <br />For me they were just too weird and I also didn't like how isolated they made you feel.  I'm going back to my old favorite, a new pair of Koss Portapro's and for at home Grado Sr-80's(...)"
1264,4,"I really like this mp3 player, and recommend it to anyone who likes to listen to music, especially those who go to the gym or play sports. It's great because you can move around all you want and the songs won't even skip! My only complaint are the headphones...If something barely brushes against the part of the headphones that connects to the player, the sound messes up. It may work for some people though--but if it doesn't, just try getting a different set of headphones that feel comfortable for you and aren't so sensitive. I like how the songs and artists' names come across the screen of the player. I have Windows XP on my computer, and I found the whole program installed easily and wasn't very hard to figure out. My player fits about 35 songs. This definitely beats any CD player..."
1265,2,"I have set up my new system this week and unfortunately there must be a defect in the amplifier.  The unit is not putting out 300 watts, my tv's 10x2 watts sound better!!!!"
1266,5,"I'd purchased this CDR-20 on June 2002 and ever since then I never had any problems with it knock on wood. Unlike the last CDR that I've used to have from Philips, I like the way this product operates. What more can I say? Other then &quot;I'm Very Well Pleased&quot;."
1267,4,"The Rio Riot is an excellent player.  It's 20 GB storage is massive.  The sound quality is great-- and I rip my CDs to WMA at just 96 kbps.  The FM reception here in NY is very good as well-- I have been able to recieve all the strong stations clearly.  While it takes a while to download hundreds of songs to the Riot, once the files are transferred they are very well organized and easy to find.  The backlight could be clearer, but not as bad as some of the other reviewers say it is.  It comes with Real Jukebox to rip and transfer songs, but Real has released a new driver that makes the Riot compatible with Windows Media Player 9.0-- making it much easier manage and transfer your music files.  I have always hated Real Jukebox/Player.  All in all, the Rio Riot is a great bargain."
1268,4,this is definately worth the money.  great features for something so small and compact.  i am also working on getting better reception on some of the stations (not sure if it is me or the radio).  i would reccomend this to my friends.
1269,2,"At risk of breaking from the norm, I've had my Sony CD player for several months now, and have some serious misgivings.  The version I purchased was a really nice blue shade, and like most other reviews here, I had a similar experience.  It looks nice, it plays fine, no pause button, but these are things I can live with.  Most of all the price was great.<BR>After several months use the price and color no longer mean anything to me.  This is my first Sony CD player and the first to wear out in this short span of time.  The headphone jack is poorly constructed and flickers and pops regularly.  I even convinced myself that I had mistreated the headphones and bought a new set of (Sony) headphones.  The problem persisted and as far as I can tell the source is in the headphone jack.  Wiggling and rotating the headphones helps, but I'm not sure how long these will last.<BR>One could argue that I, the user, have misused the device, however I've owned two other Panasonic CD players previously, and both, although more expensive, lasted very nicely before needing to be retired.<BR>Another major problem is the bass.  I first assumed this was due to cheap headphones, but even with a brand new pair of very nice headphones (again, Sony) the bass rattled and popped.  The highest bass level is really useless if you want any sound quality at all.<BR>Next time I will for sure save up a little money and buy another panasonic.  I've not had a complaint over their products as long as I can remember."
1270,4,"It's so hard to buy an Mp3 Player, because there are so many flavors, so it took me a while to choose one and even longer to buy it online. <br />One thing that surprised me the most was that you can update it's software from their website. This gave my RioMp3 so many new functions that it didn't have before.<br />I haven't tried it with WMA but it's been working fine mainly with mp3's. I've used it almost for 1 month without any real problem.<BR>I tried to play UDF Mp3CD's and it worked well, i tried it mixed (Data & Mp3s) and no problem neither.<br />A Mp3 Cd player is better then a memory card or a huge hard disk player so I can say i recommend it.<BR>It has really nice features and it's not that expensive for what you get.<br />It's very nice although it could be better. I dont like the non stop moving song title nor the dancing guys in the LCD screen.<BR>The memory button allows you to isolate a section of a song to play over and over again but it's not a big use. <br />And I've been having some lecture problems with some Cd's but it might as well be them and not the Player.<br />Good luck!"
1271,1,"I have bought this player but till now I am unable to play any MP3 disc. I tried single session, multisession, various types of MP3 files etc. No effect. I have contacted Samsung services, without any significant help. Maybe someone can help me, how to record the CD-ROM to be &quot;visible&quot; by this player ?"
1272,5,"I really like this system. It has enough power ot make a home theater, and it has more features than the pioneers do. I tried sevearl brands but aiwa seems ot be the best. I like aiwa's multi-amp idea where the sub has it's own dedicated amp. and so do the mid/tweetwers so the sound is more clear and the subs don't interfere with the hig/mid clarity and the bass is lesss boomy. I tested this in circuit city and it had pepole dancin to my club mix 98 cd I broght in to play. this system is really good and I reccomend it to anyone who likes aiwa and gadgets"
1273,4,"if you're not embroiled in the MP3 craze.  I recently purchased this radio for the second time (for my girlfriend) because it is probably the best stereo out there for the workplace.  As the price indicates, this isn't a  boombox which you're going to carry on your shoulder down the street but  rather a light to medium range sounding box which is compact in size (fits  great on the workdesk) and won't annoy the coworkers.  I would suggest  buying this to ease your time at work and only if you've just about lost  your mind if your company's central air system is driving you nuts!"
1274,1,"It would not work on my P2 233 PC.  My buddy has the same PC, but it works on his.  He also has the same Rio 300 and his works on his PC but not mine.  <br />Now it won't work on my new P3 667 PC.  It works on another buddy's  machine.  I tried to do all the things that Diamond told me...no luck...the  best offer they had was to replace it.  That's not the problem...I  recommend a USB MP3 player.  This parallel port stuff sucks."
