0,5,"Very satisfied. The M4U 1's are my return back into full-size cans after years of using in-ear monitors of various quality up to Etymotic ER-4's.<br /><br />I had 3 uses in mind – open office, train commute and digital piano playing. For me, they are great for two: open office and piano.<br /><br />Pro:<br />- balanced, tight sound<br />- excellent for digital piano playing (the Kawai CS-10 hybrid sounds incredible on these)<br />- no obvious coloration, works great on all kinds of genres from classical and opera to EDM<br />- clean and understated classy looking<br />- comfortable fit<br /><br />Con:<br />- just too big for me to travel with, went back to in-ears for commute<br />- on a hot day things get a bit sweaty"
1,5,Great headset case
2,4,"These are a more comfortable than the original pads, which I'd been using for a few years.  But honestly, I've been loving my monoprice headphones so much that I almost felt guilty for only spending 18 dollars on them.  Dollar for dollar, that's probably the best audio purchase I've ever made.  For a few bucks more they look a little less nondescript and I can wear them for longer."
3,5,I love this speaker!  It's at a  great price for the quality of sound it delivers.  Oh and did i mention it is water proof? Like what else could you want?  Seriously happy with this Photive product.  Thank you.
4,5,"Just ordered a second one to replace the one I have had a couple of years. Not certain if it is the charger or the computer that is in default but at this price, it is worth ordering to find out.  Definitely a good price."
5,5,Has been a big help in finding my husband's keys - he misplaces them ia couple times a month and can spend 15 minutes looking for them.
6,5,Overall good quality just a little thin on the area where the female end goes into the male portion. Very Thin but as long as you are careful they work just fine. Hope this helps.
7,5,"works great to pull in stations 65 miles away and beyond but be careful with splitters and long coax runs, you lose a lot of levels (db) when using those.  A mild 3.5 to 7 db boost works good too."
8,5,very good job
9,5,"Work great, sound great.  The carry case is a pain the behind, but I'm over it."
10,5,I've only used it for a couple of minutes but I can tell you it is a great Ipod dock! It sounds great and looks very stylish. The remote control works great and the FM radio is a nice extra. Definitely not portable as it is quite heavy but overall is a great product.
11,5,Love it. Size and the super sound
12,5,"I'm a Truck Driver and needed something lite and durable for my Rig. This product was easy to mount, shipped quickly, and holds perfect."
13,5,"Finding the right code for my Samsung was difficult; however, once I found it, it works just as advertised."
14,1,"After a few weeks I smelled plastic burning, opened up the lamp enclosure and the wire prongs that attach to my TV had fused together. I pulled out the lamp and the connection broke because the connection had melted together. I had to pay $200 to get a technician to replace the burned out parts. My TV works now but will not ever buy a cheap generic lamp even though this one wasn't that cheap but there are ones out there for $20 bucks from china."
15,1,"Extremely disappointing. Even the XBA-1 sounds better than this.  Highs are almost non-existent, and this results in a muffled sound that is nearly unlistenable."
16,5,Happy with it.
17,3,Poor sound quality due to shock proof material. Audio volume was also a major disappointment.
18,2,It was a good charger until I took it camping and it started smoking.
19,4,Good liked them
20,5,Very good quality.
21,2,wish it would have done more ended up buying a speaker switch instead this product just didn't meet my expectations
22,4,I love them. But they aren't as loud as I'd like them to be.
23,5,This screen really is fantastic! I couldn't be happier with it. Price is on point and couldn't get much better 😊
24,4,"These have help organize my many, many DVD collection. The only thing is flaps do not stay shut with the little tab. Have re ordered them, and will reorder."
25,3,Perhaps the product is excellent. The challenge is it is quickly becoming obsolete.  Bought it to get local stations for emergency weather updates.  I can only get a couple of auxiliary stations.
26,5,"This is an amazing little speaker, the sound is crisp and clear, any and every song sounds amazing. I'm into a lot of rap so I was expecting a little bigger bass but this is still an outstanding speaker, Bose has the best products."
27,5,AWESOME LITTLE MOUNTS FOR MY SMALL VIZIO SURROUND SPEAKERS
28,5,"I don't consider myself an audiophile, but these were quite an upgrade from my old headphones. The sound quality is amazing! I won't say that these don't tangle, but they're easier to untangle than other headsets/corded products I've owned.<br /><br />I bought them thinking they had a microphone that I could use with my cell phone. When I saw that they didn't, I thought about returning them. I'm glad I didn't. I'm glad I decided to try them.<br /><br />It's amazing how immersive an experience these earphones provide. Now I understand why people seemed so tuned out when they're listening to music -- bobbing heads, mouthing along to the music. I thought they might be a little crazy... but now, I'm one of them!"
29,5,YES! Quality built.Works well.
30,4,Not a loud as I wish it would be
31,4,Not sensitive enough for fine tuning but helped with location of antenna. Better than using the TV for  location.
32,5,Awesome
33,1,"Crapped out after &#60; 100 hrs of use, and this was a second or third replacement, of one these same p.o.s.'s that actually melted- that's right- it freaking melted, not just a little, but the whole ac adapter box looked like an ice cream sandwich left out n the sun. It's no worse than the other one they sell on here that's 12v 8 amps, neither work for long if at all. Really not sure what to do, need to run the appliances, guess I'll be searching ebay to Office Depot for 1 that'll work. I'm sure it's too late for a refund, maybe a replacement but I'm a lil concerned this Chinese made cheap crap might burn down my house"
34,3,"Great product for the first couple of months. Easy to pair, good music/listening quality. But, all of a sudden, the left side stopped playing music & hasn't worked since. I am still using the right side, but it is now a slight inconvenience as i like to have both in while working"
35,5,It works great and is so convenient!! Thank you for a great product at a great price too.
36,5,"Adore it. Sounds like a dream, super durable. Buy it."
37,5,Got this as a back-up cord for my Apple TV so I don't have to fish out the original cord every time I want to take the Apple TV somewhere.  It works just fine.  No issues.
38,5,Was as advertised
39,5,"These are being used in an outdoor solar lamp. After a few months, so far, so good."
40,5,Works good. Has adjustable volume and adjust to head size. Use this for my 18 month old and it was a little big but still worked.
41,4,"I don't think that it has too much base, it's just sounds right especially for a bigger room. Nice update of previous SRSX5<br /><br />UPDATE<br />Yesterday I turned it off and today I could not turn it on. It just didn't work. I tried reset and clicking all the buttons but it didn't help as well. after disconnecting it from power source for a 30 min I was able to turn it on...<br />I will see how it goes, but looks like it's not the last time I have a problem with it."
42,3,"Product was as listed on Amazon.  However, to me the sound was a tad fuzzy."
43,3,"If you need a headset that just works, this is for you.  But if you are really active and moving while wearing this, id recommend something else.  The buttons on this are loose and cheaply made so they rattle.  When I strenght train and strain to get the weight up or if im grinding my last rep, the buttons will rattle like a MF and ppl around you will notice.  But worst of all so will you and it gets annoyi g.  Then when you run, it rattles with each step.  Not good for working out."
44,5,it is perfect my grsndson lovrd it<br />slim snd compacted.grest valur for money
45,4,"Works well, but the sub becomes disconnected from time to time."
46,5,Works great! Great replacement!  no issues.
47,5,Outstanding
48,4,"Ok so I haven't opened a record player since I was a kid. My last one was a fisher price. So she i heard people saying this was more a toy than anything. It didn't really phase me. I'm just a casual listener, and liked the idea of displaying this near my Funko pop figures.<br /><br />The speakers aren't the best (no bass), but they're better than the ones on my phone. I didn't Experience the skipping on new records like others did. Everything played perfectly new or vintage. The 45 adapter is included, but I wish it was one of the metal ones they sell separately, just personal preference. The player has Aux in which I hadn't noticed in the description or reviews, so I was a pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />As far as the build quality it could have been better. The leatherette was wasn't glued down properly. It had scuffs, glue runs and imperfections from what was most likely a rushed build. To spite that, I am pretty happy with my purchase. I can get over the imperfections, and its a great conversation piece."
49,5,"Received my headphones yesterday. Charged them up and listened to a few songs. So far my expectations have been met and very happy with the headphones. I cannot remember if these need a burn in period like some headphones. If they do, can't wait to hear how they sound. Right out of the box I was impressed with the overall sound quality and the comfort while wearing them. No problems pairing them to my devices. Carrying case is nice as well.<br /><br />My only complaint so far has nothing to do with the headphones. I am a Prime member and paid extra for next day shipping. Ordered on a Friday and supposed to receive Saturday by 8pm. Did not make it and did not receive until Monday afternoon. Did not feel it was fair to downgrade my rating on the headphones due to shipping issue. Will think twice about paying extra next time."
50,5,Good product.
51,5,Great cable...works as advertised...throughput adequate for my needs
52,1,"worked well for about 5 months and then died (about the same time my Direct TV HD DVR malfunctioned critically. Don't know if the two are related.) thought it was just my cable box but when I had that replaced I plugged the new one back into this and it did not work either. Maybe it had gotten dusty, don't know. But will be investing in something a little higher quality."
53,4,I have used these before and they are great for keeping cords where you want them.  I use them in my vehicle to keep my usb cord to my phone out of the way.  I use them around my charging station to keep the cords from draping on the floor and getting broken which can get expensive.
54,1,"I have very small ears and was hoping these would fit but sadly too big.  Yurbuds did say take picture of your ear and they would help you with fit, but just wrote back that there was nothing they could do for me..."
55,5,"At first I thought these headphones were purely wooden for style reasons, but turns out “wood provides the best sound reproduction there is”. Having used these headphones the sound quality is impressive however not more so than any other quality pair of headphones that I own, personally I really like these headphones but would recommend you choose them because you like their style and look, as the sound quality is excellent but comparable to other quality sets out there.<br /><br />In the box you get the headphones, a small hessian ‘eco friendly’ carry pouch and an extra set of large rubber buds and small rubber buds; the mediums that come fitted are perfect for me so I always end up getting rid of these spares.<br /><br />For me the best thing about these headphones is their look; I really like the wooden styling, they are different to any other headphones that I own and to me they really look sophisticated as well as understated.<br /><br />The sound quality is excellent through the bass tones and higher ranges, so they’re suited for all types of music as well as great for plugging into my tablet for when I watch films on the move.<br /><br />All in all these headphones are a pleasure to look at as much as they are to listen to, if you like how they look you will be very pleased with their performance. Recommended.<br /><br />I was kindly provided a sample by the manufacturer to review; the opinions expressed here are entirely my own view of these headphones."
56,5,I lost the charger
57,4,My patio now has music
58,1,"Although your description says it works in EU, the list of countries on the package does not include France.  Will it work in France?  I'll find out soon."
59,5,It's a Mediabridge product. What more can I say ......
60,3,"Paired with an Apple Watch, the Bluetooth connection only works when my Apple Watch is on the same side of my body as the Bluetooth transmitter on the headset - which is the opposite wrist that I wear it one. I was willing to overlook that because I liked the sound quality and they fit my ears great - they didn't slip or fall out when I ran and they were very comfortable. Then sweat happened. I sweat a lot from my head. These headphones could only handle it for about 3 weeks. Then they started not holding a charge for longer than 20 minutes. Now they won't turn on at all. I'm not even going to bother with calling JBL to get a replacement after reading the other reviews. If you're using these for an activity where you don't sweat much or you are just a naturally light sweater, these will be awesome for you. Otherwise, don't waste your money."
61,1,"Did not work, screen was fuzzy and after trying to get help with it from computer experts We tried to return it and they wouldn't return it."
62,3,"Arrived very quickly as stated,  not very sturdy,  wobbles from side to side,very difficult to put together for the pieces do not fit well ! I guess for the price its not that bad,  if you don't need instructions to put things together ! The stand came with no instructions but like I said some people might not need them!"
63,4,"The first pair of these I bought sounded really bad (no bass at all) and after I returned them and posted a negative review, the company contacted me and offered to send me a new pair for free. I took them up on the offer and tried out the new earbuds, which sound much better than the first pair. Kudos to Symphonized for making the attempt to have satisfied customers."
64,5,"replacement purchase, no issues"
65,3,"Lagged a lot. It's a durable wire, however, when we used it on our Samsung TV, the picture lagged. We thought it might have been the cable box but when we switched it to another cable, it worked perfectly fine. Then we put this cable back and it didn't work well at all."
66,5,Needed this to replace my older receiver so I could have an HDTV.
67,5,use it with my wii works great
68,5,Great product. Great price.
69,5,"Works great, wonderful sound, easy to use."
70,4,"Okay, first and foremost, I am not an ultra sophisticated audiophile. I searched for many years for a headset that was the equal to an ancient pair of RadioShack Realistic Powered Headphones with BaseBoost that I had used and loved for nearly 15 years before it finally bit the big one.  I like my music loud, clear, and with plenty of serious base. Yes, such a lowly brand made what to my experience was the best headset I ever owned.  To replace it, I bought expensive headphones from AudioTechnica, Sennheiser, Panasonic, Sony and more recently, Sol Republic, but all left me wanting more base, more volume, more clarity and that seemingly unattainable- more UMPH.  Hundreds spent, all for naught, my ears left drooping in disappointment.<br /><br />Then on a whim, I decided to throw caution to the wind and try Bluedio's R+ Revolution.  In a word, it really was a Revolution!  It was as if the Audio Gods heard my cries and decided to throw me a bone.  Oh what sound!  And the features! And the battery life!  What bliss!!<br /><br />Well, now the good folks at Bluedio have the updated UFO series.  So, is it worth it?<br /><br />First, by way of comparison, let's review the specs of the R+ Revolution:<br />-Has the same frequency response and THD as the UFO.<br />-Comes with Bluetooth 4.0 as opposed to the UFO's Bluetooth 4.1.<br />-Has the same audio jack as in the UFO.<br />-Has the same battery life, which is still astounding!<br />-Supports NFC for easy Bluetooth pairing.  Note that the UFO series doesn't have NFC.<br />-Supports USB audio when connected to a PC. The UFO series doesn't support USB audio, just USB charging.<br />-Includes a micro SD card slot for stand alone play feature with built-in equalizer.  Micro SD is not included in the UFO series, but does have 3D audio sound capability that lends a Concert Hall quality to your music and is great.<br />-Microphone included in both units for picking up calls on your mobile phone.<br />The R+ Revolution sounds aboutthe same as the UFO- I say about the same and it's likely because the speakers in the R+ headset are well broken in and the UFO speakers are brand new, so they should eventually sound the same in terms of loudness and clarity.  By way of testing on the UFO, I used a Windows Lumia Icon phone which has great sound, an HP Envy Recline PC with built-in Beats Audio sound processing and an Amazon Fire HD tablet.  Testing was done using audio cable and Bluetooth for comparison and I found you can get higher volume and sound via Bluetooth on the UFO or R+.  Sound is clear, base is booming, mids are decent.  Using phone\tablet\PC equalizer functions helps you get the sound just as you like it when you are connected via audio cable.  Easy peasy,<br /><br />The UFO series headset is well built and much lighter than the R+ Revolution.  It's very comfortable to wear for long periods, important when you also wear glasses as I do, as other headphones can cause pain when pressing against your ears while wearing eye glasses.<br /><br />So would I pay $200 for the UFO series.  Depends.  If I didn't need Micro SD card or USB Audio or NFC Bluetooth pairing, then the UFO series would be just the ticket since they are more stylish and lighter to boot.  But having been exposed to the many features of the R+, I can honestly say that for me, the new Bluedio headset is a bit of a simplification that shouldn't cost $200 if what you are getting is a Bluetooth 4.1 chipset and slightly better build quality and materials, which is why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Either way, if you are looking for a great pair of Bluetooth headphones that helps cut the chord to your phone or other devices and are looking for sound quality that is equaled to wired headphones, then by all means give Bluedio a try.  Bang for the buck, you won't find better sounding Bluetooth headphones for the same price."
71,5,These worked great. I needed a new set of headphones for the airplane. I watched a movie with them. Sound was great. I owned a more expensive set before and debated whether or not to spend the extra money and am very happy I didn't.
72,4,Bass is pretty good if pushed harder inside. Sound quality not bad for the price.
73,5,"Was a great speaker but it died on me when I tried to charge it the second time.<br />Sound is loud enough for music<br />Phone calls weren't so great, I couldn't hear the person on the other side and they couldn't hear me.<br />All in all decent speaker just wish it wouldn't die so fast"
74,5,"It was easy to install the mount and to hang the TV (60&#34; Vizio) on the mount.<br />The mount is strong and does not sag even when fully extended.<br />I find that it is not difficult to reposition the TV up or down if you firmly grip the top and bottom of the TV.<br />It is also easy to move the TV side to side by gripping both sides of the TV and turning and pushing/pulling it to the desired position. (I am 6'4&#34; so I have ample reach to maneuver the TV by myself, those with a shorter reach may need another to help assist in positioning the larger TV's)."
75,5,Awesome product! Fast delivery!
76,5,Great product!
77,4,"This inexpensive In-Ear Headphone set provides surprisingly good audio fidelity, especially given the price. I now have two sets of these and I keep them stashed for handy access in my car and at work (who knows, I may buy more to stash elsewhere - like my girlfriend's car). A pleasant surprise was how comfortable they are in my ear, but your mileage may very on that. When I first received them, I did an audio comparison using 'White Rabbit' by the Jefferson Airplane as the audio source. I compared these to my Sony Headphones, an Apple earbud, and a Koss earbud. To my surprise, they beat the Koss earbud. (imho) I'm giving this set a solid 3 stars for the sound which I think is pretty good for a set of earbuds... and another star for the comfort. (actually, only a half star) Honestly, I don't think you can go too wrong if you buy these."
78,4,"Great sounding speaker, compact and all around no complaints.  Do seem to lose bluetooth connectivity once in a while but only for a second and not much.  I had the beats pill xl and got this to replace after the recall on the beats.  Much cleaner sound at higher volumes.  Beats would force too much bass and distort, infinity cuts the bass back to avoid distortion."
79,5,Excellent products!
80,5,I love these headphones. The sound is excellent for the price and they are cuter than I expected.
81,1,"Save your $$$. Really horrible earphones. It actually hurts your ears to put them on, forget putting them on for an extended period. Secondly, they keep slipping from your ears. Had to return it."
82,5,"Works just as it says it would it converts RCB to HD and can be a little touch so you just want to make it is secure because if you touch the screen may go back to no signal. Works quickly and surprisingly when I plugged in my apple TV to it, it adjusted to the size of the screen and left no unseen edges"
83,5,"Fits perfectly on my headphones that recently had its original foam torn and broken. It's not the thickest, but its substantial enough."
84,5,I bought the speaker based on the comments of other buyers. For the price YOU cannot beat it.  It is a great product.  I already want to buy another one for work.
85,5,"These headphones work great for me!  My ears must be oddly shaped because earbuds just do not work for me, and I don't want the headband version while I am at work.  These sound great and stay attached.  What more could you ask for in a pair of headphones?"
86,5,"An excellent resolution to my needing more volume and not disturbing my wife.  fits VERY well, battery last a LON time, and very comfortable to wear.  No complaints.  I was so impressed I bought a second set for the bedroom TV."
87,4,"Sweeeeeet headset!!  For the price, you can't beat these headphones. Good sound through Bluetooth connection. Haven&#34;t heard the corded sound yet..assuming it should only sound better that way. Decent bass response. Not overwhelming like other overpriced, name brand headphones. I'm not an audiophile, by no means but I know a great buy when I see it and hear it."
88,5,good ! the sound is very good!
89,4,"I opened it and plugged it into a couple of old Polk RT5s. Incredible power for such a small amp. I did end up buying an eq to tweak the sound, but its a great little amp for the price and size."
90,4,Works but you have to sometimes toy with it with some TV's to get the sound to work by plugging and unplugging again and again.
91,1,Didn't work. Threw in garbage. Wasn't worth the effort to try to return. No Zero star rating?
92,1,It only last me 3 days after that it's not working at all.
93,5,This is the best money I have ever spent.  They are easy to use . And aren't too bad to look at and all my CDs are stored according to genre.  I love it.
94,5,Worked great.
95,5,"Nice and long , reliable and a fraction of the price you will find at a brick and mortar store. I use it with a DISPLAY port adaptor on my MacBook Air and it functions flawlessly."
96,5,"It if, it came on time. Really impressed."
97,1,Poor....no directions. No software
98,1,There's a lot of feedback and it doesn't work with some devices
99,5,"Yes, it is good, nice bass, right level of middle and high frequency"
100,5,"What a great gift for someone who does not even know they exist.<br />I have bought a lot of Belkin products, and all were well made for the price, this too.<br />My daughter loves it, and her husband is an IT guy and didn't know these were available. Usually he is helping me, it was nice to return the favor."
101,5,I love these cans! But they are a little hot in the summer.
102,1,It fell apart and never worked.  This was a total BUST!
103,5,"Real APC genuine battery, excellent quality. Just as shown on site. I am an IT professional with over 30 years experience and the APC brand is worth the few extra dollars. spend the money and get the best. They definitely last longer and are better made."
104,4,"I contacted Amazon because I thought the Digital Audio Player was defective, but it was not. The headphones that came with the unit were defective, but the player itself was so worth the money I paid for it. This is the second unit that I've owned, with the last unit purchased 7 years ago. I was lucky to have found this unit at a reasonable price on Amazon. The only reason I didn't rate 5 stars, was because of the defective headphones. I will continue to shop with Amazon."
105,1,Junk. Use the freebies at the theatre.
106,5,Great sound from a little speaker. Love it!
107,5,excellent
108,5,This is one of the best little bluetooth speakers you can find for this price. It doesn't blast sound but it is clear enough for everyday use and great that you can bring it anywhere. I would reccomend and buy another as a gift.
109,4,"Easy install. Fits great. Did not have studs where I wanted to mount it so had to use heavy duty sleeve-type hollow wall anchors (a.k.a. Molly Bolts) to secure to wall. Is holding well. Might be a good option to add these anchors into the kit - just in case other people need something similar, but don't know about other options. All and all, great product and great price."
110,5,Good product
111,5,Works great and for a very reasonable price!
112,4,It looks good well packaged
113,5,"Got this so I don't have to use my cell phone data to play music. Works great, picks up far-away stations. Now obviously the supplied headphones are garbage, so you should probably get a good set of earbuds or nice headphones."
114,5,Great service and great product.
115,5,"These headphones are seriously one of the best things I've ever bought myself. I'd been buying and returning Bluetooth headphones, trying to find a pair that wouldn't budge during my HIIT workouts, and these were the only ones that measured up for under $100 (They were $99 when I bought them).<br /><br />The battery life is good and it charges pretty fast. You can rinse them off after your workout, which I like. I wouldn't swim with them, I don't think that's really their design. They come with a bunch of different earbuds.The sound is also pretty darn good.<br /><br />The only drawbacks are that you can't skip songs right from the headphones, and the volume button changes the volume really dramatically with one click. They also make your ears kinda stick out, which is mainly a vanity thing, but the cord behind your neck isn't slack at all, which is good because it doesn't get in the way like some other Bluetooth sets.<br /><br />All in all I'd definitely recommend them if you want headphones that won't budge for your workouts."
116,1,"If you're like me you'll get about 1000 mAh out of them, tops: a *THIRD* of what they're rated for. You get what you pay for. Stick with 18650's based on Panasonic or Sanyo cells. They're much more expensive but they actually deliver what they promise."
117,1,"UPDATE 7/13/15 ---Unit refused to power on today after numerous attempts and recharging. Rating dropped to 1/5.<br /><br />It is quite obvious that this was made to look like an Apple iPod. Looking from the front, it looks very close to an iPod, however, it is much thicker, doesn't feel high quality like an iPod, and has a completely different user interface.<br /><br />It will play most of the popular formats. On Mac, syncing files is as simple as plugging this into my computer, dragging music files into the folder(s) on the MP3 player, and hitting sync. The instructions aren't the best, but if you have any computer knowledge and/or are good with technology, you should be able to figure out the file folder issues with relatively little effort. Even still, navigation on this device isn't the greatest, but it also isn't the worst.<br /><br />Sound quality is good, so long as you have good headphones, and playtime is going to vary highly depending on several factors such as how much music you have, how much you use the track pad, how long the screen display is used, and how loud you listen to music. For my initial test on a full charge, I was able to get 3 hours and 15 minutes out of it, using it what would consider &#34;normal&#34;. You really will only get between 2 and 4 hours of playback which is understandable at such a low price.<br /><br />There are lots of other nifty features that I will let you play with, but one I thought was better than expected was the video playback quality.<br /><br />If you really want an iPod but can't swing the cost of one, this is a good alternative. This is especially a good device to give to kids because if they break it, you aren't out on too much money.<br /><br />Sample provided for review"
118,2,"I am not sure if I got a defective unit, but I tried this on my parents computer and it seemed to be working fine with a noticeable difference compared to the on-board sound card. I then took it home and tried it on my desktop AND laptop, but the sound was identical. I spent hours researching why this could be, as well as trying to tweak the settings and drivers multiple times, but no luck.  I ended up buying the Fiio E17K ALPEN 2 and couldn't be happier. With something this expensive and portable, it should just work. I don't want to spend hours trying to figure out why it isn't working. And for those who wanted to know what type of hardware I was working with at the time, it was this:  HD 650s & HD 598s Desktop (self-built) on Windows 7 Pro Laptop HP 8470w on Windows 7 Enterprise"
119,5,Awesome product. Really well made. I have had it running from the outside drop pole to my apt now for over a year and its great. When you cut it open its amazing how many layers of protection it has. Even the cable guy when he came over was impressed with tits quality. Better then what the cable company gives you.
120,5,These ear pieces work great would recommend to others!
121,1,Best for anything but to fit hesh headphones!
122,5,Crazy loud for such a tiny thing! Great battery life and great sound.
123,5,fast and item as described!
124,3,"I have been a big TIVO fan for years.  It seems clear that the company is not investing in up to date technology and is simply winding down, destined to go out of business.  TIVO doesn't even repair its equipment, sending you to a third party company.  Too bad."
125,5,"Good to connect different accessories for TV or Stereo,"
126,5,Works well.
127,5,Charges various batteries had it for a few months and zero problems.  I would buy this again.
128,5,"I really can't believe the price of these and I can't thank AT enough for the offering.  The quality beats a lot of supposedly high-end phones, 150-250$ range.  I'm an audiophile that really does prefer a balanced sound, not sharp exaggerated highs.  The soundstage is fairly wide with excellent instrument separation, the lows are deep and powerful, but do not bleed into the mids, vocals sound gorgeous.  I would say the mids and highs are just right, never sibilant.  if you have quality tracks, a good seal and the right device, you'll be rewarded with euphoric sound."
129,5,Great. Eady installation
130,5,I was working at a location where me and some of my friends were missing music and we wanted to hear it together. Therefore I ordered this speaker. It sounds very good and battery time is well enough for a working day.
131,5,I added this to my hot tub that just had an auxiliary input. It is now a bluetooth enabled hot tub for a small fraction of the cost to have had it added by the store.
132,5,Wonderful product.
133,5,"Great workmanship with clean, clear sound. As the Q&A section says, the 50W per channel is really about 20-25W into 8 ohm speakers, but plenty loud enough. I use this with a Casio PX-150 digital piano outputting to small good quality speakers. The piano itself has an anemic 8W per channel for the internal speakers, so I just bypassed the internal amp/ speakers via the headphone jack into the amp. This amp brings out all the dynamics and subtleties the Casio sound engine produces, which is way more than I can say for the internals. For my application, this amp creates zero detectable heat. I just drilled 4 holes in the faux wood piano stand under the piano and strapped the amp under the stand with two heavy cable ties. Even the high end digital pianos for 3x the price cannot match this set up."
134,3,"I bought these earphones because Amazon was offering them for pretty cheap and they looked nice. My friend had ruined my Shure SE115s and I was looking for an easy replacement before a trip to Europe.<br />The sound quality is good (I'm no audiophile, I just listen to music from my phone and iPod) and the asymmetrical cord works fine for me but takes a few seconds to put in right. I don't really like the texture of the rubber on the cord because it tends to catch on things and tangle. I haven't bothered to change the ear tips, but the right one keeps falling out of my ear and it's annoying.<br />Overall, I find these earphones to be a little irritating but they're a pretty good buy for the price."
135,3,"I haven't noticed a difference in amplified vs. non-amplified, some channels are choppy even though I live close to the center of the city."
136,3,Sound quality is good but the fit is a little awkward.  Maybe I have big ears but these seem a bit tight and not very adjustable.  Still not bad for the price.
137,3,Poor range. Better audio than the Belkin.
138,5,This thing is great for travel - most hotel rooms don't have enough outlets for the 21st century.
139,4,"I loved the watch, it pairs with my Bluetooth headphones. Plus it is easy to set up or I'm just kinda techie. Nevertheless, I still need to test the battery life."
140,5,"this item came earlier than expected, and was easy to install. I would recommend this to anyone."
141,3,"My son has short hair, and he said that these caught his hair and pulled it."
142,2,Item arrived on time. Quality of item seemed fair. The speaker had a some weight. However my speaker did not work. I returned the next day.
143,4,"You get what you paid for. They are great looking headphones and the quality of sound is good. Not the best, but decent enough to listen to music to. They are a bit bigger than what I expected but I love the feature of being able to fold them together."
144,2,"I loved this when I first bought it. However, the Bluetooth stopped working soon afterward. I liked the Bluetooth, because I used the unit as a sound marching through an app on my iPhone. I like that it shows the temperature. It kept good time. The light is Amber, which took a little getting used to. The bright setting is way too bright, but the lower setting is fine. I'm not using it at the moment, because of the Bluetooth failure."
145,5,Just got this hooked up last night and all I can say is wow! I paired it up with the Dayton Audio SA70 70W Subwoofer Amplifier. The amp has the adjustable cutoff and gain control which allows you to adjust just how much bump you want to feel. I also purchased a RCA Y splitter on here to be able to split the signal from my main subwoofer to the Dayton low Level input which worked great. I did a quick Demo last night with IronMan II & III. The effect takes the movie watching experience to a whole new level (Even at very low volume) kids and wife sleeping upstairs I still got the effect of big felt bass without waking the household. I kept getting out of my chair because &#34;it felt&#34; as if the house was shaking. When I got upstairs the movie was hardly audible. I only purchased one to start with but I am back for 1 or 2 more. I have a 3 section sofa that I will be adding them too. So far just in my recliner! There seemed to be a good mix during the AC/DC music scenes in the movie feeling the bass drum. Not crazy but noticeable. During explosions etc during the movie this thing really kicks! Note.. At a regular listening level for movie enjoyment I was able to turn up the gain on the Dayton Audio amp to where the vibration was to much. Meaning power to spare! When turned up to much it just wasn't the illusion anymore that the effect was coming from the actual speakers anymore. Highly recommend
146,5,Fits good around the ceiling mounted TV that I have on my back porch
147,4,Good product.
148,5,"ever since I purchased my first eneloop pro batteries for my nitecore Ea41 I truely understood the importance and quality of these NI-MH batteries in high drain equipment and devices. In all of my tests I get not only the best runtimes on my flashlights with eneloop but also the highest lumen output for the longest time which means that they maintained as high as they could the max levels of efficiency in all of my AA flashlights compared to energizer,duracell,rayovac,ativa ecc...it just make me so frustrated just to think that I was wasting so much money on junk rechargeables and cheap alkalines when for even less of a price these batteries are rechargeable up to 2000 times and give me a better bang for my buck. this is where a lot of people tend to be mistaken:<br />in a lifetime of using normal alkaline batteries we spend a minimum of ,give or take, 50-100 $ depending on how often you use them and in my case even more. however from now on i have been going only with eneloop and not only has it saved me  a lot of money but it has also saved me so many trips to the local battery recycle point which was a pain in the you know what. besides , eneloop offers such a high quality material and internals that I have no problem on recommending this product to anyone tired of wasting money just think about it (2-3$ a month) x (a year) x (10 years)=  a lot of wasted money . so in my opinion not only do you offer your equipment a non leak-high energy-low discharge energy source but you also save money in the long run which is very important to all of us .I gave one star to shipping ecc because the battery case was bent and torn and the plastic of the battery case was stuck to the batteries. thank goodness I was able to clean the batteries up nice and tidy, I believe that for the price I am paying I deserve at least a decent presentation and an in tact and clean battery wrap cover that the buyer shouldn't have to clean. I currently use these in my  nitecore EA8 and charge them with my nitecore I4 intellicharger:<br /> both recommended.<br />P.S<br />another reason for buying these batteries is because they are so d@mn $exy! eneloop truely gives great importance to detail and that is more than enough to convince me on any product.my nitecore I4 intellicharger:  both recommended. P.S another reason for buying these batteries is because they are so d@mn $exy! eneloop truely gives great importance to detail and that is more than enough to convince me on any product."
149,4,The sound coming off of these computer speakers plus DFX audio enhancement software is more than the neighbors can stand! My PC is a concert hall now!
150,4,As expected.
151,5,loved it
152,5,So far lighting speed on downloads on my Smart TV!!!
153,5,Very easy to replace! My can't live without .headphones are as good as new!! My ears thank bose!!
154,5,works great
155,3,the speakers started to change from clear to rough after daily use for about two months. and the music was not even played loud. poor quality speakers but the price is great for a temp and it does look fabulous with the long red wires and the comfortable rounded ear piece.
156,1,Didn't work really at all Crappy Cord.
157,1,"It says 5s but my phone won't even let me download the software and the instructions aren't clear, is there a sight I could use?"
158,5,Works great!
159,3,"I originally gave these a five star rating, but I only had them for around two months. Now that I've had these for well over a year, I am very disappointed. They have absolutely amazing sound quality after I burned in the speakers, however sound isn't what the problem is. I take very well care of my products that I purchase, but after three months of use the side where the volume controls are located, the buttons stopped working. after seven months of having the product, the cable had a short in it. (Which wasn't the end of the world because I had a spare.) Then last month I was using the headphones and I had to get up to do something, so I lay the headphones down on my bed, in a normal way not tossing them but being gentle, and I come back to put them back on , and the right ear cup falls of the headband. there is no way to fix them and I was pretty disappointed in the build quality."
160,1,The wire came out the second time my son used the headphones... Not happy.
161,5,great
162,5,Item as described.
163,5,Perfect for outdoor people. I got this for my husband. There will be no reason for him not to get in touch on me while he is kayaking lols. This waterproof and I love it. Pretty small and very light. Great product
164,5,"This micro HDMI to HDMI adapter cable worked perfectly with my ASUS Vivo Tab. It was packaged well, arrived in good shape and was HDCP compliant as advertised.  The picture and sound quality I get when using it is crystal clear."
165,5,"No complaints, great quality, wonderful price."
166,5,fast delivery and great deal.
167,5,"Make sure you restart your computer after installing the drivers. Initially thought I had a defective device but after a reboot, it sounds awesome! I was getting a bunch of what I would call &#34;digitally&#34; sounds on my standard PC headphone jack. This eliminated them and now my mid-range Bose headphones sound the way the should! Great product.<br /><br />One note - I couldn't get it to work on my Samsung Galaxy S5 (Lollipop). It didn't affect my review because I only needed it for my PC."
168,5,Huge sounds from a tiny device
169,5,Handles my 60&#34; Sharp with NO issues. LOVE IT!
170,5,"This is an awesome little unit, especially for the low price. Big sound that fills the room and is great to bring outside with us when we are using the Grill and entertaining. Goes anywhere and is out of the way while providing exceptional sound. Plug it in and play endlessly or disconnect from the power cord for at least 8hrs of music before the battery dies."
171,5,Because why wouldn't you save a ton of cash and just buy them right here?!
172,5,Do not pay more for cables. More expensive HDMI cables bring no additional benefits. google it.
173,5,"Exact fit, perfect for adding 20 ft to the power cord."
174,5,Great
175,5,Great.
176,5,"Sound great, feel great, look great.<br />Note that although the cord is replaceable, the port is recessed and I had to take a power drill to mine to get my tangle-free cord to fit."
177,5,I just love my little shuffle while I am swimming. It makes for much more interesting laps. I ended up having a problem with mine because I lost it while moving. After a few months without use it stopped charging much to my dismay. Underwater Audio's customer service was great. They sent me a new one with no hassles at all!
178,5,No bad burns
179,2,Too expensive for what it is. I returned it.
180,4,"Slightly expensive, but well-thought out system that gives you plenty of room for a 60-inch TV with all the electronics. I have a turntable and needed the wide accessible area under the top. Went together easily. Just need to take your time and look at the diagrams closely to make sure you're getting everything installed in the proper slots before taking action. Finish looks nice, but easy to scratch. It's not a premium finish. Overall, I'm very satisfied with this piece. It looks nice in my house."
181,5,Excellent!
182,5,good
183,4,So far so good
184,5,This has been a life saver. And the perfect amount of plugs too!<br />Fits everything I need behind my TV/Entertainment center.
185,5,Great speaker. Bought it for the boat to take offshore and it works great. Lasts all day.
186,3,"would not physically fit into my m-audio firewire audiophile, but it's probably due to the soundcard and not the  ac adapter? just a tiny bit too large..."
187,5,Good and reliable
188,5,love it
189,4,"[[VIDEOID:456863982d66a11f5a5492c2d7fd11cc]] I made a short video talking about this item, so check it out to get the details.<br /><br />Firstly, let me say that this unit is built well. It is made primarily of metal, and all of the ports feel sturdy and everything fits tightly. It does successfully convert VGA and audio to a single HDMI signal, so if you have this legacy technology that you want to adapt to a newer monitor then this unit will do it.<br /><br />However, make sure that you communicate with LinkS prior to ordering to make sure you will receive a US ac adapter. I will say that they have very courteous and helpful customer service and they are making this error right for me, but just be aware. I was able to test the unit only because I already had a 5V adapter I could use.<br /><br />Overall, if you need this type of adaption then go for this iteration."
190,5,Works great in a led 120 lumen flashlight.
191,5,Perfect
192,5,Outstanding service and quality product. Everything as advertised and promised.
193,5,Powered up the fifth wheel.  Been working great.
194,2,I was able to draw in only two channels from within 20 miles. Could not reach the 50 mile range advertised. The reception of the two was excellent!
195,4,"This is a very serviceable product for a very modest price.  Used it on a flight from Los Angeles to Fort Lauderdale and it cut down noticeably on the jet noise.  I was able to listen to and enjoy music.  Obviously not as good as my friend's high priced noise canceling earphones from the brand leader, but good value for the money."
196,5,this was bought as a gift for my wife. easy to use. well made. can be hard to find specific songs. overall great player!
197,4,"I AM AN AUDIOPHILE and was looking for something I could use to sleep in, and run with.  I have custom Logitech IEM as well... and for what I needed these work great.  Sound quality is spot on, actually well above anything else in the under $50 range.  I think you'll be happy... not a single issue with them coming out during exercise."
198,5,Good screen
199,5,I bought 2 of these around 3 years ago for about $29.99 a piece and they still work fine even today.<br />I had one transmitter base connected to the TV and have the 2 headphones connected to the same base.<br />The sound is really great and the range is really good. Really great for watching movies and TV and especially useful at night when quiet time is needed.
200,5,"The clock surpassed my expectations. I particularly appreciated the ease of setting the time, date,and day of the week indicators."
201,5,ok
202,5,"Love it!, is as good as beat, and a whole lot cheaper!!!"
203,5,I wanted a shorter cable than the one that came with my HD800s. This cable works beautifully. The connectors snap firmly into place. Note that they only snap into place from one orientation. The headphone amp that I use has a 3.5mm phone jack so I am pleased that the cable comes with a 3.5mm phone jack so it just plugs right in without  needing any adapters.
204,5,cool
205,4,The alarm clock is great and works well. Alarm is a little quiet and if you are using a Windows phone you won't be able to pair to the blue tooth. If your phone supports wireless charging then you will find this a clock a plus
206,5,"These batteries are perfect for my purposes. They keep their charge for a really long time. I don't even have to take the charger with me when I go on tour for weeks at a time. If I charge them before I go, I always have enough power."
207,3,Works decent. Like that it is flexible l. Case breaks easily You can tell they are mass produced
208,5,"Very strong cable, not cheap made."
209,5,There is not much to say. Either the amp works or it doesnt. This one worked.
210,5,"Excellent speakers for the money and size. Great highs, mids, and adequate bass. Superb clarity on vocals and instruments. matched up to BW and these were a much better value."
211,1,BE AWARE!!!!! Don't buy this product.  I just used it while I was travelling in India.  I ruined two IPhones and an external battery pack from using this piece of garbage.  It should be criminal for this junk to be on the market.
212,5,Wonderful everything I needed and more.
213,1,"Terrible product. I bought this as a gift for my husband and the first time he used it his phone inside was soaked!! Because it was a gift and not used immediately the return window was closed! Buyer beware! I had bought another color of the same product last year and had no issues. I have used it dozens of times kayaking but this Orange one is JUNK! My friend had the same experience with this color, could be irony but I wouldn't take the chance! Gave one star only because zero isn't an option."
214,5,"This is a great value pack. While I unfortunately have not done any in-depth testing as the other reviewers on Eneloop batteries, these have proven themselves to retain their charge very nicely (months on end) while providing solid power for both high power devices (LED flashlights) to simple remote controls and bluetooth keyboards. I'd recommend this particular kit over the other Eneloop one if you don't require the C and D spacers... in return you get extra batteries."
215,5,Perfekt and quick delivery thx
216,2,"Took a chance on this one, but as usual you get what you pay for. At first it worked ok, though not as bright and it takes longer than usual for the tv to initialize after turning it on. After a month it started going out for brief periods. So I ordered an authentic Philips bulb (three times the price), which is much brighter and works properly (no delays)."
217,5,"works great, didn't notice any signal quality loss on my pc, ps3, or ps4 when splitting to two tv's"
218,1,"This was the wrong adapter, so I canceled the order."
219,1,That's why I wait a month before I review. I got it last month and hardly use it. Mostly on sundays when I'm able to stay home from work. Turned it on and one of the speakers is already blown. My friend got a jam speaker (different model) and that works fine.
220,4,"Product turned out to be a better player than I expected. I was a bit uncomfortable paying the price I did for what I expected to have less capabilities than advertised, since I have purchased several different ones and each disappointed to some degree. This one began to be be as irritating as I expected since (as with all these products from China) the instructions did not match the product. After experimenting with the buttons based on what I learned from other models I found it to be workable. I have difficulty with getting it to read/show video or pictures I tried to add, and the video files are amv. I especially wanted it for my granddaughter who needs to see the words to her songs as she practices.<br /><br />The seller description does not mention it has a clip, but one of the reviews did and that was a selling point for me. I also like the compact size. The next thing that mattered was being able to add a good size memory card. We got a 32gb working on it. The fm receiver was able to get a few stations with reasonable clarity which impressed me since none of the others I have tried did. The txt reader does not format to the screen at all, so words will spit to the next line improperly. That can probably be worked around by preparing files with screen size in mind. It must also have a built in mic since I was able to record without one.....that was a pleasant surprise. As we get comfortable with it we are finding it to be a very satisfactory model."
221,5,Second one I've owned. Good tune out of the box. Well made.
222,5,"What's to love - really.  But that's the choice. It replaces one just like it that fell apart after three years of use.  Still, it does what it is designed to do. That's why I bought it."
223,4,"I love these speakers. They are a little hard to understand how to link them together but individually they are great too. I wouldn't agree that they get an 8 hour battery life but as long as you have an outlet nearby, all is good. :)"
224,4,"fast shipping, good price, great product"
225,5,Worked perfectly!
226,5,"Bought this for a trip to Europe.  Used it in the Netherlands, Germany and Italy.  There were two that came in the package so my husband and I were able to plug in both of our cell phones at night."
227,5,"Works as expected.  Came with my home and the in wall/ceiling speakers.  There are 27 speakers total throughout the house, split into 4 zones via this speaker selector.  I can't say when it was purchased, but I have owned this home for 7 years now and have had no issues with this guy.  If it bombs, I will gladly replace it with another Niles, although I'd likely get a 8 zone box...."
228,2,"I dont know if I'm the only one, but my headphones won't block out sound. They work great in passive mode but no matter what I do the noise cancelling part of these headphones won't work!!"
229,2,Eats batteries like crazy. The built in rechargable battery outlasts the alkaline by a factor of ten. Yes! I said TEN! It will run on the rechargable for 3hrs+- and only a half hour on alkaline.
230,4,"These are budget speakers, so don't get them confused with or expect them to perform like high dollar speakers. With just 4&#34; drivers, these speakers simply cannot reproduce lower bass in music. When listening to music with lower bass present, you really know you are listening to small speakers. They would suffice if you just want some music played at moderate volume levels and aren't trying to fill a large room. However, if you pair these speakers with a decent 10&#34;-12&#34; subwoofer, the speakers handle the highs and mids well enough to blend with a sub nicely. Factor in that these speakers are often on sale for $35-$40 at Frys, then at that price they are a good deal. If you had a 7.1 system. two pairs of these would make very capable surround speakers for a budget system."
231,5,"Shipping right on time. Love the Sony earbuds,great sound bass is nice."
232,5,"When I think about the investment made over the years on Cameras, Televisions, Computers and so on, I need to do two things, have a stiff drink and make certain I protect the small fortune I've poured into my electronics.<br /><br />Bryson may not be &#34;Big Brand&#34; like Zeiss which I use exclusively on my camera lenses but this stuff is superb. Our Televisions, Computer screens, Phones clean up perfectly and bright.<br /><br />The included micro fiber cloth is huge and superb. It's nice and thick and grabs every spec of dust and debris like a magnet. Just make certain you wash it after each use as micro particles can scratch LCD and Glass.<br /><br />Considering how much solution you get, the quality of the included cloth and excellent performance - the Bryson cleaning kit is a very good value at an extremely reasonable price.<br /><br />Highest Recommendation"
233,5,"6/15/15: Update: SENTEY EARBUDS HELD UP IN THE WASH.  My son accidentally left these in his pocket, and didn't check before the shorts went through the wash and the dry.  It was not only until I was folding the laundry that I found these in a tangled mess.  I was SURE that they were gone.  (SEE PHOTO).  I carefully untangled the ball of wire they had become, plugged them into my phone, and took a deep breath.  Over the years we've had other headphones meet an untimely demise by getting wet.  Much to my shock and amazement these worked just as well as the first time I tried them.  I wanted to update my review, because I know I am not the only parent this happens to ... and if you are looking for a pair of headphones that will stand up to this, then these are for you!!  We are a two adult, two child household.  Each person has a phone and a tablet.  The bottom line is - we are ALWAYS needing headphones.  We are on-the-go often and between the two kids each listening to something different we need to have headphones on hand at ALL times.  I have several other Sentey branded items and chose to purchase their in-ear headphones for a spare pair.  Well they weren't spare for more than a day! I have used them a good handful of times and LOVE them! They fit comfortably in my ear, have a crisp clear sound and don't allow sound to escape like other brands do.  In addition to several pairs of these earbuds, I have also purchased the Sentey earbud case.  Can I say an earbud case is adorable?? Well it is! It is literally the size of the palm of my hand but it is harder sided so my earbuds won't get crushed and keeps them free of dust/debris.  Better yet, it's easier to keep track of them too! My spare earbud covers fit neatly in the little mesh pocket and my Sentey headphones fit perfectly inside.  When you buy the headphones, get the case!  Headphones and case provided at a discounted price, for my HONEST review.  I was not compensated in any way to state my honest opinion."
234,5,Fit perfectly.
235,5,"Works as intended, took awhile to figure out what button did what and the software is anything but user friendly but after some trial and error, got it figured out and have converted most of my cassette tapes to mp3.<br /><br />The instructions were hard to read and understand, those Chinese should hire American's to translate into the way we really talk."
236,5,This is the best ipod nano in the  world it has touchscreen witch is a plus and its new. It has a seek nice design. you can not play games witch you never have been able to. So you can track fittness like your steps and things. you can listen to music of course. You can watch TV and videos and alot of other cool features also its very small. it can fit in the palm of my hand but yet it is still very easy to use and navigate thongs on. My favorite ipod nano yet. Another awesome product from apple I love it.
237,5,"This thing is awesome!  Not only do I love the color, but I've had it for a month, use it pretty frequently, and have yet to charge it.  The only thing I don't care for is the ear-splitting BEEP when it connects.  A small price to pay for being entertained for hours."
238,5,"Excellent quality and packaging. Quality cable, not cheaply made."
239,1,"Wow. What a piece of crap. The tuning buttons randomly control all other functions. Press &#34;tune +&#34; and maybe you will set the alarm. Or maybe you'll turn on the bluetooth. Sometimes, you even activate the tuning/scanning feature, if you're lucky. Same for &#34;tune -&#34;.<br /><br />I've had this out of the box for 15 minutes and it's getting wrapped up and sent back. I wish I could get a refund on the time it took to unpack, repack and write this review.<br /><br />Warning: This product is made of cheap plastic and feels like you are operating a child's toy.<br /><br />UPDATE: Additional problems:<br />- Time automatically sets 30 minutes ahead- clock is perpetually a half hour fast!<br />- The equalizer doesn't work.<br />- Bluetooth connections fails after ~5 mins of playing."
240,5,"I am the proud owner of a Harman Kardon AVR-340 and Harman Kardon Sound sticks II They both work Great but i needed the ability to connect my macbook pro , or iPhone with out the audio cable. It is also great when people come over and they want to play there music on my sound system .  i get about 15-25 feet range with these. the blue light blends in beautifully. the only downside they both show up as &#34;HK BTA 10&#34; they are both within range with each other but no big deal."
241,5,"I've tried several other swim-audio options, and never had success - the music was muffled, poor quality, or otherwise difficult to operate. This is literally as easy as using your iPod Shuffle. I've used it for 2 years with no problems. I had an issue with the headphones about a year ago. I called customer service, and the service was excellent. Highly recommend. 5 stars!"
242,4,"The Monster Octagon Over-Ear Headphones are super adjustable. You can adjust the span across your head by pulling the top part out to what you need. The part that covers your ears swivels so you can adjust them to the place that you almost forget that you have them on, That is the best part to me. Just fiddle around with it until it seems perfect. They do have some weight like the old time headphones did. I did figure out an improvement for myself. I put a little piece of foam rubber that I had right under the middle of the part that goes over your head. Now the weight doesn’t bother me. So, the company could just make the padding where the headphones go over your head thicker and they are good to go. You may not need that extra padding but in case you do, remember that this works.<br /><br />But the performance is wonderful. It does silence the sounds of your environment. So you don't hear the lawnmowers going, and the two people outdoors screaming. Ah but the bass sounds win my heart! What you hear has depth, depth that you won't get by just listening to your laptop without them. I listened to something that I had heard many times before and I was surprised that there were drums in the piece.<br /><br />The set of headphones comes in a great box that I want to keep to protect them when I move. It has a drawstring bag for storing the cords and the adapter. I love having an adapter so I don't have to switch headphones to fit whatever you want to plug it into. Also in the kit box, there is a cloth for cleaning them."
243,1,sounded great!.. for one month. left side just stopped working one day. 34 days after I got them. (4 days after the return policy expired) And I probably used them 15 times.
244,3,As described.
245,1,This doesn't work for Samsung galaxy  s6. piece of s***. Don't use it
246,5,Great radio for the price
247,5,"Compact speaker..decent sound.  Clear dialogue, but not a lot of bass(it is a compact device!!). Overall...a nice iPod sound extender at a reasonable price."
248,2,"No matter how many times I measure this, or how carefully, it is #12 NOT #10 wire.  I can't say if this just happens to be a bad batch or if it is the norm.  It is cheap, I suppose, even for #12 wire, but is still no bargain at $.34/foot.  I have to admit not doing any recent comparison shopping for #12 zip cord.  Since it does not have a UL rating, I don't even know if I can use it safely for lamp cord."
249,5,"Nice, inexpensive speaker wire.  Looks pure copper to me (not clad aluminum).  Easy to run, easy to strip."
250,5,I've bought several pairs of these in the past. They are my go to choice when I need a set of passive crossovers. They work great.
251,5,"3 months in use, still working."
252,5,Works great. Get stations all over US. Grandpa loves it!
253,5,Perfect in every way and ...silent!
254,5,Easy to install great Product
255,5,exelent
256,1,"It worked for a bout a year and then just stopped working. When I looked a little bit better at other reviews I learned that this is a common problem. I also bought it because of the wifi option, but never got it too work properly; first of all it was very hard and time consuming to install it and then the connection was never strong enough or the receiver didn't recognize it. I would never buy it again nor recommend it to someone else."
257,5,the antenna is excellent works real good picks up 25 channels like a sentence I'm amazed just have to find the right location
258,5,Sound as good as $100 buds I have owned.
259,4,"I ordered the 27&#34; first because I needed a longer desk top stand but it wasn't high enough. I then ordered the 22&#34; only for the legs so I could combine them to the legs of my original purchase. It made my 27&#34; riser perfect for what I needed, doubling the height. Monoprice should think about selling additional legs only, just for this purpose. I emailed them asking if this was possible but their response unfortunately was no. The glass is very thick and sturdy. I have my TV and sound bar resting on top with my cable box and DVD player below. There's enough space left above the cable box to allow for air flow. I'm happy with my purchase. It looks much nicer than those &#34;boxes&#34; that you see online."
260,5,Very comfortable and allow you still hear noise but not to where it is too distracting.
261,5,Perfect for our movies! Threw out all those cases!
262,1,These were a waste of money the volume is low and you cant hear a thing ended up buying another pair of a completely different brand
263,4,Anyone have any idea where to use the small metal C-clamps?
264,5,Exceptionally well made.
265,4,Took some time to come but it fits even when i thought it won't. You get what u pay for nothing special but does what it should.
266,5,Easy to install and hook up.  Lowered internal cabinet temperature by 20+ degrees.
267,5,Fits well and sturdy product
268,5,AAA
269,5,"Bought these on a whim to replace a set of cx300 ii I've had for a half now that still worked fine, but just weren't quite cutting in sound quality anymore after I picked up a set of hd558s for home use. With almost no English reviews or information on these, other than them being the successor to the well received fxt90, I wasn't sure what I was really getting. Needless to say, I've been blown away, and Its now my 558s that ate totally outclassed. While there's definitely a strong v shape to the sound signature, everything is crystal clear (more so than my 558s) and just amazingly positioned on their expansive soundstage. I doubted iems could even have such a thing, but I'm a believer now. Listening to live recordings it's easy to picture yourself there, and feel exactly where everybodies standing on the stage. Drums have a strong but not overwhelming punch, distortion guitars just scream, and strings soar.<br />  While I'm sure it exists, I really couldn't imagine what a better iem would even improve on aside from one point. And that's the cable. The cinche on the cord keeps microphonics down to a bareble level worn cable down, and its nonexistent worn over ear. These aren't really designed for the latter though. You basically have to swap l and r to do it, and the cable is a bit stiff. Wouldn't recommend these for jogging as a result. That's about the only case I can think of where these aren't the best thing going under $200.<br /><br />Fwiw ems shipping took less than a week from Japan walker, and arrived well packed. Would do business though them again"
270,4,good sound. sub woofer cuts in and out when streaming music . works fine aux
271,3,"I feel like they embellished what they listed as the charge time for these batteries, because it takes at least 10-12 hours to charge them to full, and even then, they'll only last you a good eight hours max of charge time, if you're gaming.  The directions for the charger say that there is a fire danger - which makes me not want to set these batteries to charging when I'm not in view of them.  Finally, the directions also do not tell you that the &#34;charged&#34; indicator light does not go from red (dead) to green (charged); rather, it has a grade of colors, from red to orangish, yellow-green, then green.  Overall an average to cheaper set of rechargeables, of which you might want to think of getting a set of eight instead of four (to offset the time lost for the long recharge time)."
272,5,ADD MORE MALTY LED'S  WITH OUT THE GUESS WHERE TO PUT THE WIRES  CAUSE THESES ARE COLOR CODED
273,5,"GREAT RANGE, NO LAG, GREAT PRICE, AND IT DOSE WHAT I WANT IT TO DO."
274,4,Yup it really does say Sardine. I don’t know why and I can tell you where that decision was made but what I can tell you is its a pretty decent little speaker with some good functions.<br /><br />It sounds pretty good for a mini speaker and both the connect and range were good. Doesn't have much bass but one wouldn't expect it to just sounds like a mini speaker but it is solid for what it is. Aux in works fine and a mini LCD clock as well.<br /><br />I think with the color in mind its a good one for the kids and that is probably where they are aiming it. The FM radio is the surprise here working quite well without the need for an external antenna.<br /><br />Very solid four star speaker. At $30 and the inclusion of an FM radio I think your getting some good value.<br /><br />Product provided for review - its just my opinion
275,5,would purchase again
276,5,"Although it is low priced, it works pretty darn good.  Converted accurately."
277,1,defective & damaged
278,5,Really enjoy exploring a variety of music from around the world.  It would be nice to have more buttons to instantly tuned in<br />enjoyable stations. The sound quality is great.  I use it at the head of my bed often for ambient sounds to encourage good sleep.<br />The radio does meet my expectations.  I had purchased a slightly cheaper model before and relished it so added this one<br />even more enjoyment.
279,5,"I bought them because I wanted a great all around headphone, and didn't want to buy a dac and amp. I really happy with my purchase they sound great and are super comfortable."
280,5,Works great.
281,5,"This does exactly what I need it to. Fast delivery, easy hook up, instantly easier to plug things into the hdmi port of the TV that's too high on the wall to plug and unplug things because I used it as an extension chord of sorts."
282,1,"I was very excited to see these connectors, as they seemed to be just what I needed to replace a BNC connector that was accidentally ripped off the cable on one of my security camera leads.  Unfortunately, the product leaves a lot to be desired.  I think it would be OK if it wasn't called &#34;solderless&#34;, because I can see how a secure connection could be made by soldering the cable to the connector.  But the &#34;solderless&#34; connection is rather weak.  In addition, the rubber boots covering the connections are on so tight that they are difficult to remove.  Attempting to remove them actually destroyed two of the five connectors (the boots pulled the &#34;guts&#34; of the connections right out of the body.  Good thing I only needed one and not all five!"
283,5,good quality
284,5,"I have to say i was skeptical of this little speaker as I was used to Bose sound quality but this little round thing is working out to be a winner for me. As matter of fact, it appears the more I use it, the better it sounds. The only thing I think should be changed which doesn't affect the operation is the AI voice. Come on Really? I &#34;already know my bluetooth is already opened!&#34; Well duh! And who ever they used to do dub the AI is obviously someone not into the speaking profession. But anyway, I have to say that is minor and the sound is great. Definitely worth the money!"
285,4,"I generally don't write reviews. But after a lot of research for the right mount I found this one and this perfectly matched what I wanted. I reduced one star due to the weight as this cannot be fixed by one person, need additional help for markings.  I have an inbuilt TV cabinet in my apartment making it difficult to select a normal flat mount. This one helped me fix my 47&#34; LG smart TV in a side wall and extend it beyond the cabinet, like and 'L' shape to hang my TV. It did take a while to assemble the parts but its easy with a lil bit 'parts assembling' sense :) had a hard time finding the studs in my wall which took longer than actually fixing this mount. But the slot provided for the lag bolts are good to adjust the position of the mount as per the studs.<br /><br />One caution to take a note of, go get  3&#34; lag bolts as the ones which come in the box are 1.5&#34; which did not help me in my apartment walls."
286,5,my husband loved it thank you and would recommend
287,5,"Picture is better than ever, and the price was great."
288,5,Brought new life to our vintage Magnavox stereo.
289,2,"i ordered this mini tower speaker fo my new 50&#34; flat screen as an add on because of the tinny sound that a lot of flat screens have these days because of lack of depth for better speakers.i wanted more bass and better sound quality to watch movies and reading the reviews on this it sounded perfect for the price.well the sound was not any better and still very little bass and on top of that during most scenes with music in them this thing rattles so bad the music is unintelligible as music at all.i unfortunately tried it for a few weeks hoping by some miracle the speaker buzz/rattle would go away-no luck-and had waited a week too long to submit for a return to be processed-my bad for sure but I would expect amazon to step up but I can't file a return,i just get booted.dont buy this-spend a little more and get something better"
290,5,Thank you
291,1,"Junk.  These are not made by Roland, but appear to be infringing on Roland's name to make them look legit.  These should not be sold on Amazon."
292,3,Wasn't very loud
293,5,looks high quality.  works well.
294,5,Works great
295,5,"amazing sound, easy to set up"
296,5,I bought this as a present for my daughter and she loves it. Says she can fit all her sorority sisters in pics now.
297,5,"Ive listened to and/or bought gaggles of headphones.  I think these are the one of the BEST sound-for-value headphones out there. Great fit,  great feel,  great look, and most of all great great sound.  I heartily recommend the Skullcandy Aviators.  Peace .n. Living in Stereo"
298,5,Good
299,5,Best cable ever better then best buy cables forsure will definatly buy more
300,5,Very good charger with an outstanding display.
301,5,Great!
302,3,"I looked all over the internet for a cable like this.  It's a solid cable, the coils are tight and hold their shape so far (about 3 months).  I would have given 5 stars but it's crazy expensive for a cable like this."
303,1,Horrible sound quality... when it works. Only works intermittently and in very short range. It's going back as soon as we can pack it up!
304,4,"Good with a few cons:<br />- These feel slightly heavy for a clip-on, which prevents me from using them for long periods of time.<br />- You don't look too nerdy with these on (well that is my opinion)<br />- The strain on my eyes is greatly relieved as I sit in front of my computer at home and laptop+display at work...very very helpful even for gaming<br />- The center mount are visible and distracting when looks at certain angles (especially when looking to the left) I wished the mounting bracket was a bit smaller<br />- Kind of heavy which puts pressure on the nose pads of the glasses...which gets annoying sometimes<br />- For the price this is a worth a try, I would definitely recommend these to fellow spectacle wearers"
305,4,for $25 in early 2015  this is a pretty solid buy.  to me it is uncomfortable to wear all day long but was fantastic to have on hand.  Im no audiophile but  the songs that are played on it are recognizable.  I few things  I wish it had<br /><br />better fitting ear inserts.  or a different material  or something  that would make it comfortable.<br /><br />some kind of sound equalization for phone conversations.  my  girlfriend  is.... animated sometimes  and can go from whisper to yelling  pretty quickly and unexpectedly.  something to even it out  so I dont get scared by yelling in my ear
306,5,Flawlless
307,4,Good.
308,5,"I love my new Oontz!  I initially bought a lesser priced speaker from another manufacturer, but it died on me in less than a week.  I love the solid feel, and weight of my Oontz. I like the fact that this little speaker can be hooked up via Bluetooth to my other device(s) that are Bluetooth wirelessly, and yes, via a wire (included) to my device(s) which are not Bluetooth.  I also like the colors of the diodes.  I bought the rose-colored speaker because to me, I really had no color preference, and all the other colors are made the same anyway.  But as I'm on a fixed income, the few bucks I saved as a result of the chosen color was appreciated.  And lastly, because I am currently an Amazon Prime customer, I received my Oontz really quickly!"
309,5,"Got this for use with the TC Electronic Level Pilot to connect two monitors, works flawlessly!"
310,5,"Very nice product for charging my LP-E6 batteries, effective for fast charging two at once. I also like the levels they are accurate."
311,1,"it came out of the box dead. and when i checked if i could return it, it said no."
312,3,Very comfortable.  My 9 year old daughter really likes them but they broke after three months of use for no apparent reason.  The sound is very muffled now and not usable.  I might buy them again because they are reasonably priced and the green color is my daughter's favorite color.
313,5,"This wire is clearly of a high grade, and was thick enough for a small speaker project I was working on. The wire color is not gold but a bright copper color, it's just that the color balance of the product photo isn't right.<br /><br />Casing on the wire is nice & thick, but doesn't sacrifice flexibility. I'm fairly sure they delivered on their oxygen-free copper as well, as it hasn't reduced in shine whatsoever since I purchased it."
314,5,Outstanding value and quality.
315,2,Bought this to replace the battery in my jump pack at work. This battery worked for about a week and now will only hold enough current to jump a car if I leave it on the charger all the time. I don't think it is going to last very long. Next time I'd save the money for a new jump pack.
316,5,Fabulous ear buds.  Some folks have complained about the durability of the cords but I haven't had a problem.  You hear nothing but pure sound no exterior noise to distract you from your music.
317,5,Definitely a worthwhile purchase! The clock is easy to set. I like that you can turn off clock & just have on the projector. Easy on the eyes. Easy to see. The numbers are big enough you don't have to reach for your glasses to see the clock.
318,3,One of the round barrel screws on the inside was out of round. The wire would come loose easily. Found this out after HOURS of trouble shooting no signal...
319,2,"When I first received this item, I thought it was excellent. After the first one stopped working after only 3 months I bought another. That one only lasted two months and the sound was only half as loud as the first. Too Bad!"
320,5,This Sinewave battery back up is just what I needed. I have a laser printer and my old UPS would shut down when I turned the printer on!
321,5,Awesome!
322,5,Nice
323,3,"&#34;They're Okay&#34;, as a three star rating would suggest, pretty much covers it. The earbuds are not altogether uncomfortable, but merely adequate and you have to remove them to give your self a break every now & again, as they can be ever so slightly trying otherwise. The sound quality of these earphones is not bad, but there is no real improvement over what came with the phone these were intended to replace; it would have been just as easy & reliable to stick with the originally set then to get this Monster Mobile &#34;upgrade.&#34; Again, simply &#34;Okay.&#34;"
324,5,Works perfectly....
325,5,Easy to work with.
326,5,"After shopping in stores and online I finally found exactly what I was looking for and at a great price. This model has great features such as two 2.1A USB ports, 12 outlets spaced with room for large wall warts, and surge protection. My only minor disappointment is the mounting holes on the back. They are only slotted to allow for a secure vertical orientation. If they were shaped like a &#34;+&#34;, then I could have mounted it horizontally like I had planned."
327,3,"I really like the unique style and how they felt around my neck. And the difference in the quality of sound compared to my mom's LG's was miniscule, but I thought the Rokit Boost sound quality was slightly better. However, after about a week of light use, I noticed that the sound volume in one bud started going out and the magnetic strength in the other bud started to weaken. Also, with the slightest touch, it was easy to knock the buds off the magnets while the unit was around my neck. I guess that's because there's no real nook that the buds rest in like the LG's. As you can imagine, that became quite annoying when trying to answer calls and reaching for buds that aren't in their place. I returned my pair, but if these issues were fixed and the ear bud docks were better designed, I would totally consider purchasing them again."
328,5,Good quality/ Price rario
329,5,"Great, love it, fast delivery"
330,5,"Good quality ends, got a good connection on first crimp"
331,1,poor quality and sound. pass on these and spend the extra money.
332,5,"Needed something to switch my PC monitor between my Tower and my Cable box that I have on my desk, this works perfectly.  It will automatically switch the signal to what is coming in too which I thought was a cool feature.  I shut down my tower and it pops to the signal coming from my cable box.  Perfect switcher."
333,5,"I can remember every mouse I've used since I started PC gaming (2001):<br /><br />Intellimouse 2.0<br />Razer Viper (yeah, this was their first optical gaming mouse, wow I'm getting old)<br />Logitech MX518<br />SteelSeries Ikari Optical<br />SteelSeries Sensei Raw<br />Zowie FK1<br /><br />Each one lasted a good 3-4 years under heavy usage and I used them until a component started to malfunction like a button, scroll wheel, etc.  The thing to go first on the early gaming mice was the coating and buttons.  I can remember I used my MX518 until the left click button started double clicking and the coating was completely peeled off.  I replaced it with the SteelSeries Ikari, it lasted about the same amount of time as my MX518 (3.5 years or so).  After my Ikari scroll button started flaking out, I was in the market again for a new mouse.  I didn't do much research...the Sensei price was decent, I wanted to try a different shape, it had good reviews for the most part and I liked my last SteelSeries mouse.  Turns out the Sensei has a laser sensor, every mouse I had used before was optical.  I didn't care much for the Sensei shape, it was too small for my hands, which I'd say are average male size.  The biggest problem was the laser sensor.  It tracked horribly on my Qck+ at the 450 dpi setting.  I've always been a low sensitivity player no matter what game I'm playing.  I guess the laser mice are OK for MMO or RTS players, but it's pretty much garbage for any FPS game if you want accuracy in your aim.  I immediately did some basic research after realizing the Sensei had to go and felt kinda stupid after how easy it was to find a lot of advice suggesting to not buy laser mice for FPS games.  Through my research I kept seeing Zowie mice being recommended, specifically the FK series.  Gave it a shot considering I wanted anything but the Sensei at the time.<br /><br />FK1 Impressions so far (6 or so hours of use):<br /><br />As you can see from my list above, I've had a mix of ambidextrous shapes and ergo.  Up until now, my preferred shape had been the ergo shapes for right handed players with my MX518 and Ikari having the most mileage.  The FK1 is advertised as a ambidextrous claw grip mouse.  Like I said, I have average male sized hands and it fits perfectly.  The most comfortable and controllable grip I think for the FK1 is more of a hybrid claw-palm grip.  The top of my palm is still on the mouse with just my fingers slightly arched.<br /><br />The tracking is amazing.  Probably the smoothest I've ever used. Makes sense considering the sensor is supposed to be the best. It glides great on my 2nd Qck+ (Sensei tracking was probably worsened by a 6 year old pad, but still not acceptable).  I really like the no frills, plug-n-play approach.  It gets annoying when you have a program for your headset, keyboard, and mouse.  Definitely unnecessary.  The DPI change is easy to do and I think the steps are laid out well.  I used 400 dpi for CS:GO, 800 for Dota 2/non-FPS games and general PC usage.  The left/right click buttons are definitely the stiffest on a mouse I've used.  I like it though, last thing you want to do is accidentally click in a game and it really isn't a problem after 10 minutes of getting used to it.  The scroll wheel is similar, you won't scroll unless you mean to.  I think those features mean the switches will last longer and won't get worn out as fast, but time will tell.  The side buttons seem robust like the left/right click too.  You can also adjust the lift off distance, the point at the sensor stops tracking, for different surfaces.  Out of the box it is set to cloth pads and a polling rate of 1000hz.  I haven't seen any issues with either so far.<br /><br />I have no problems with the FK1 so far and I think it might become my favorite over the pioneer MX518 if it lasts and is reliable."
334,4,Works well as expected
335,5,"Christmas gift for my son, he loves it."
336,1,it does not work right with my detox beat it only works in 1 headphone its like and off brand of a beats cord
337,5,Very well made.  Just remember that the pitch is 5mm.
338,5,Works great.
339,5,Arrived in very timely fashion and when placed in the battery pack worked great!
340,5,It arrived within the expected time and worked just like I wanted it to. I drove a ground rod outside my garage and run a ground wire from it to the grounding block. Then I run the coax from the antenna to the grounding block and another coax from there to my TV.
341,5,"Great hdmi cable, good price and works well. The only problem I have is that isn't quite long enough to reach the couch. I plan to order their 50 foot one."
342,5,Great sound and durable. Dropped it twice and works like it was a new.
343,5,Prefect.
344,5,Works well. No set up needed.
345,2,"I'm about 15 miles from a huge transmission tower in San Francisco.  There is a small hill partially blocking the path between that tower and my home.<br /><br />My old RCA HD antenna (ANT1251, which cost about $30) gets an excellent picture on all of the lower number VHF channels (ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, PBS), and pulls in several higher number channels.  For the extra money, I was hoping this Mohu 50 would pull in additional channels.  Instead, it does a worse job on the channels I already get with the RCA.  The channels cut in and out, making it impossible to enjoy a show.<br /><br />When this happens with the RCA rabbit ears, it's easy to adjust the &#34;ears&#34; or move the device a few inches to clear up the broadcast.  But with the Mohu, the unit is pretty stationary.  You can't just move it around.<br /><br />This product might be OK in a flat area, non-urban area.  But it's not so great in my city."
346,1,Did not pass sound only Video. Don't waste your money on this cheap product. One of those might work/might not work things.
347,2,"good quality and good sound, just waaaaay to big for a kid; oversized"
348,5,"Adjustable, about 24 inch screen max capacity. Good price not heavy duty, fair trade off."
349,5,they do what they are suppose to do at a really good price
350,5,perfect size and perfect volume. Ull be happy with tbis product its a must buy i love mine use it everday litterly.
351,5,"Works great, I would buy again very nice!"
352,5,"Works just like it says.  It does the job.  The 3M adhesive on the back of the infrared sensor didn't stick to anything, but that wasn't a big deal to me.  I have an AT&T dvr and a PS3 going into it and the sound is going out to a Vizio sound bar.  Probably worth spending a little bit more money on this nicer product than blowing you're money on the cheap ones."
353,5,"great cable, perfect sound"
354,3,"Cable works fine, but the fit was very tight and somewhat difficult to connect to my Lenovo docking station for T61."
355,4,"This iPod is totally worth every penny! It makes the monotonous act of lap swimming a lot more fun. The included waterproof ear buds, though having a decent sound quality, are pretty uncomfortable for the 1.5 - 2 hours that I'm in the pool. For this reason I cannot give 5 stars and I'll probably be looking into some new earphones soon."
356,5,Excellent.  Well made.
357,5,Fabulous been looking for these for some  time
358,5,I wanted to return to lap swimming but found it too boring. Diver MP3 player has saved the day. I’ve been using it for 5 months now and it works great. I download audio books from my local library and listen as I swim. I also download online podcasts. I highly recommend Diver MP3 player.
359,5,works well
360,4,Assorted sizes would make this package better instead of a one-size fits all deal.
361,5,"Every time I pull them out for use, I am grateful I don't have to spend time Un-tangling the wires. I have thought several times that I want to tell everyone how much I like them. I finally got around to it. I am in my late 50s so I am not into a lot of music. I am not sure how they are for that. My grand daughter does like them. I think the volume is about right for listing to voice. They just sit comfortably in my ears and don't fall out easily. I use them with work out equipment and they do great. For the price they are a great bargain. If I loose them it is not the end of the world."
362,5,Excellent quality. Excellent product.
363,5,Very nice
364,5,Just have for djs... Best quality
365,5,Very nice product.  Was pleasantly surprised by how high the quality was. I expected much less. I will remember this manufacturer
366,5,"Excellent service, good value and product appears to be as good as the original. An instruction sheet would have been helpful but videos online solved the problem."
367,5,"this thing is really nice,"
368,5,I purchased this for my husband. He loves it. It's small enough to be portable and the clip is nice for attaching it to various things. The sound quality is awesome for such a small device. We are very happy with it. The quality of the overall product is outstanding. Great value.
369,4,as advertised
370,5,"I know what you're thinking -- $1200 for an AUX 3.5mm to 3.5mm (mini to mini) cable??<br /><br />I own over $200,000 in audio equipment and even more over the years (it never ends...). Truth of the matter is, *digital* interconnects don't make sense at $1200. BUT ANALOG DOES.<br /><br />You can ignore the marketing hype -- 99.99% Pure Silver, 72v DBS, PSC+, etc. It just simply works, and is FANTASTIC. I A/B'd (blindfolded, asked someone else to swap cables) this Audioquest Angel, a generic 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable ($10), and a mid-line Audioquest Victoria 3.5mm in my Lexus LS600H w/Mark Levinson Premium Audio. I could immediately hear the subtle nuances the Audioquest ANGEL brought out - deeper, fuller bass, excellent treble that wasn't sibilant or rolled off.<br /><br />It's excellent for car stereo use via the AUX jack, or even for connection to speakers via iPhone/Andriod/iPad/Macbook, etc.<br /><br />It's also worth noting that for a nominal fee, Audioquest can reterminate the terminations (e.g. 3.5mm to RCA or RCA to RCA, etc), should you need different terminations in the future.<br /><br />Bravo, Audioquest, Bravo."
371,2,Never worked for my older Compaq laptop. This product is NOT a converter. Ended up buying Video Secu PC to TV converter. I recommend that product if you are trying to display what is on your computer onto a  CRT TV.
372,5,Very good headphones live them
373,4,Works well... buy the one with the longer battery life
374,5,"get speaker, very rugged. takes a beating"
375,5,They work... with original deans and aftermarket deans.
376,1,all the batteries we dead totally worthless. the price was to good to be true
377,5,"Bought this for transcribing audio interviews with a lot of background noise and I wanted headphones that wouldn't alter the sound and helped with clarity. I'm really impressed with how much these headphones helped me understand each word spoken in the recordings. They're also very comfortable to wear and sort of seal your ear.<br />This morning also plugged them into my iPhone to get better sound during a phone conference (iPhones tend to have terrible sound for phone conferencing) and they were so awesome. Could hear everything so clearly and with half the volume! On top of that, they are also great for blocking external noise so now I also wear them when my dog starts barking at the neighbor's dog! :D"
378,2,"Bad sound quality, don't stay on your ears when exercising, rubber buds came off very fast. There are better options out there."
379,5,"Good receiver with hdmi in/out. Has more than enough power to get to live full orchestra volumes. The automatic EQ works well, saves lots of faffing."
380,5,good size fits right next to the bed so I can listen at night and not disturb anyone.
381,1,"First of all, this did not fit in the TV, even though it said it would, so anyone reading this, BEWARE! Now I'm being shorted money because I had to pay over $7 dollars to ship this thing back, AND I had to drive to the UPS store , more money wasted!!! I'm not happy at all with this product, and I feel I should be receiving ALL of my cash back!"
382,1,Does not work. Do not buy. Do not waste your time/money.
383,5,"Fast ship, works perfectly. Thanks!"
384,2,"I still have these and they sort of work, but started giving me trouble after only a few weeks. One of those situations where depending on how the cord is situated, the audio quality differs. Sucks because I usually like Sony's stuff. I probably just got a defective pair is all."
385,1,"Do not waste your money. Bluetooth functionality does not work beyond 2 feet. Wireless sub-woofer goes on and off (only 3 feet away). Poor quality bluetooth, and probably rest of the components - good for profit, very bad for reputation and brand.<br /><br />Sony - please do not make false claims and release products that do not work as advertised."
386,5,"These headphones are awesome! Especially for the price. I saw a few people wearing them at the gym and asked one of the guys if he liked liked them. He recommended them and told me he got them on Amazon. Not only are they great for listening to music on my smart phone, they are great for phone calls and have a mic built in. It is nice that they fold up for storage in the little cloth sack that came with them. I recommend them to everyone I know."
387,4,Louder than I expected from such a small and cheap portable bluetooth speaker. Have no complaints!
388,4,"Great headphones. My 2.5 year old son loves these headphones that he got for Christmas. The sound quality is good, I like that they won't go super loud, since he LOVES turning up the volume. The flower on the band was cheap and flimsy and lasted all of 2 minutes before getting broken off, but that was fine by us."
389,3,It might just be me but I feel like this speaker gets quieter as it gets used
390,5,"These have to be the best headphones ever invited.  I'm not saying they are waterproof, but I have washed mine a few times and they still work!!"
391,5,Charges.
392,5,Wow! I was not expecting to get a Microphone with this projector. It's stand-alone play back capability of DVD's far exceeds my wildest dreams! I am truly on cloud nine!
393,5,"These were a gift to my wife, an editorial professional, who reports, in all seriousness and without any trace of irony, &#34;These have changed my life.&#34; I believe she means these have helped her focus closely on her work; have minimized distractions; and have, in general, made every working moment in these cans better than all the moments before. Having tried them myself, I have to agree. If you haven't tried them, give them a shot to see what you think. I believe you'll be shocked and pleased."
394,5,they work great
395,5,Works great as advertised! It is a 1 way cable so make sure you get the direction correct but worth the price and doesn't loose the quality over the long span.
396,4,If you looking for a budget friendly set of ear buds that have a lot of BOOM then look no further. I used them for in the gym to keep me focused and pumped up. I have no complaints really considering the price.<br /><br />The low end of the JVC HAFX101 is crazy. It is deep and powerful that can muddy up the sound a little but I wasn't after a detailed sound. I wanted an aggressive and enjoyable sound that didn't cost a lot. The mid bass is also strong and is a little muddy too but that is to be expected. The midrange has a nice sound that beats out most other ear buds in the price range and can compete with some more expensive models!<br /><br />You really can't go wrong with these. I had to get my fiance a set because she kept stealing mine. If you want a mic the JVC HAFX201 has it and is practically the same.
397,5,its working on our tv
398,5,Transferring music from tapes to CDs
399,3,You can't really see 3D with these glasses but the screen is clear. I would recommend for kids that don't know the difference.
400,5,There is SO much variation in build quality with these things that it's nice to see some that WELL MADE!
401,5,Fantastic headphones for the price.
402,5,Great buy.
403,5,This is my second portable CD player. My first one was by Sony and I would have to change the batteries after each CD. A hassle and expensive. I have used this RCA player for several hours and have not changed the batteries yet. The ear plugs that come with it are not comfortable or fit the ears very well. Ear buds work much better.
404,5,I love it. It looks great in my car it's got all my stuff in it. Its pretty I have no complaints. It serves it purpose while being fun and cute.
405,2,"volume adjust is counter intuitive (to turn volume down you have to turn knob up). Radio tuner is imprecise (I hear multiple stations all at once). Headphone output has way to much hiss. Even with blue tooth, sacrifices to much for compact size and price."
406,5,great
407,5,"Great clear sound,sleek design.snug fit.Very satisfied with these headphones & service"
408,2,I had it for a few months (Maybe 6) then the thing crapped out on me.
409,5,"I was skeptical at first, but I have to say that I'm extremely impressed with the performance of this antenna.  I live in a townhouse that already has a Master antenna system installed on the roof that performs poor to mediocre.  I wanted to receive Chicago channel 61-1 which shows a lot of Liga MX soccer games which the roof antenna couldn't pick up.  This antenna picks it up with a steady 60% signal and I have it mounted indoors in an upstairs bedroom.  Needless to say, all of the stronger signals are picked up near 100%.  I'm very pleased."
410,5,Worked great. If your small tv won't hang with this you shouldn't hang it.
411,1,Broke within a week.
412,4,Only negative is you have to take off of base when it times out.
413,3,I have 4 of them but the last one didn't work right. Otherwise they're pretty awesome.
414,3,too tight on my head but great sound. good for someone with a small head
415,5,"This item is great. One of my HDMI I'm put was damaged, which left me with one. But now with this item I am able to reconnect my other items. I love that it comes with the remote for easier access."
416,5,Does nicely what it says it should do.  The fine tune button works nicely and fixes marginal channels
417,4,I love these headphones!  They stay put very well and sound good.  My only small complaint is that they take me awhile to get in.
418,5,"Perfect, just what I needed. I gots me tunes back!<br />Yipeee!<br />Can I get a Whoot Whoot!"
419,4,Good product
420,5,"Better sound that I was expecting, and a super small profile."
421,3,hopefully will be of use while overseas this summer
422,3,"Works great and easy set up, however, does not have a very far range. From the reviews I read I was hoping for more than 20-25 feet range."
423,3,The product is great but the shipping took longer than expected
424,2,Stopped charging after about two weeks :(
425,5,Delivered on time and as promised :)
426,5,Put it the batteries and it worked immediately.  No problems whatsoever.
427,5,This little guy is quite a bit bigger than I expected. He works well with my Kindle and even better with my android smartphone. I really like the retractable power cord. His eyes light up when charging/charged. Great price.
428,5,Works great with my iPhone 6 and OBDCarDoctor.
429,5,"Bought this as a gift and it was a huge hit!  Bluetooth or radio, with a display so you can see your presets.  This one has 3 suction cups instead of just 1, so it is very secure, even when wet."
430,5,GREAT IDEA
431,1,too bright at night i could see it from outside.
432,4,"I wish it was lighter. It is a transformer really. Does the job fine, just don't overload it."
433,3,Sounds quality is pretty great! But if you want to use these for working out then don't get them. They are bigger than I expected and I have trouble keeping them in my ears even with the ear hooks. And the wire is way longer than I expected. I would have prolly choose another kind.
434,5,Great product fast shipping love it
435,5,"I bought this to be able to use a vacuum I oredered from the UK. It works great. It is very heavy but I only have to move it one time when I vacuum, since my vacuum cord is really long.<br />The transformer though has a very short cord.<br />The only thing that annoys me, it that the plug on it is kinda low, so when I plug in my vacuum the plug hits the floor and bends back..."
436,3,adequate
437,5,"This is a very nice articulated tv mount. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to use it on my 50&#34; lg, because of the location of the connectors in the center of the back of the tv. They were covered up by the bracket. It wasn't advertised as being ok for a 50&#34;, Just be aware of the connector location on your tv. Other than that, it would have worked fine for the 50&#34;"
438,2,I needed a white UPS to blend in with the room.  I didn't realize that the APC Back-UPS connect contains NO GROUND PLUG receptacles.  The UPS plug itself is only a two-prong plug.
439,5,"This speaker packs a big punch for being as compact as it is.  It definitely performs better than I expected, I have another small Bluetooth speaker and it doesn't even come close to this one.  I have used it at work with my iPhone for training and had several coworkers asked me how much I paid for it and where did I get it.  I have recommend it to several people."
440,5,This thing is overkill for my 32&#34; LED TV but I wanted something that will expand to a larger TV down the road.  I broke one of the supplied screws off in the wall without much effort on my part.  The others were fine so I might have had a weak screw.  They give you extras so It was really not a problem.  Good product!
441,4,I use this cable to hook up my iPhone to my radio. It does the job and when I'm done could out if the way. My only gripe is I had to have my last one replaced because the jack came away from the cord. But it's cheap and the company replaced it no questions asked. So I would buy again.
442,5,No problems after 2 two years of use.
443,5,Fast delivery and works as promised!
444,5,Great product and service! Thanks!
445,5,I love these cables and all the accessories they give you with them. The adapter is very handy and would cost 2-3 bucks on its own and the velcro ties are very nicely made. I will not be switching from this brand unless I needed ones with a slimmer connector but beyond that these are my go too.
446,2,"Firstly, this does not feel so robust and doesn't really fit my head.<br /><br />Secondly, the Bluetooth software is poorly made.  The audio volume adjusts well, but the system volume stays at the same high volume, which hurts my ears so much (especially during the night).<br /><br />Thirdly, when you press buttons to adjust volume, skip track, etc., you can hear a loud click.<br /><br />I kinda regret that I bought this..."
447,3,Came in wrong color
448,2,"Does not work as advertised.  Connected PS3 & PS4.  Must turn both Playstations on i order to be able to play either one.  Will not switch between them unless both are turned on.  Emailed supplier for workaround and got useless response.  Considered returning, but decided it wasn't worth the bother."
449,2,"I had to return this item because it was defective. Upon unpacking, the amplifier power cord simply broke off where it joins the wall adapter. Too bad because I was expecting better based on this antenna's numerous positive reviews. I posted this review because 1byone solicited it."
450,4,Stay in your ears very well. Great sound and easy to connect to bluetooth. Well worth the money but the only problem I have had with them is that occasionally I have difficulty getting the charger into the input.
451,5,Cases are perfect!
452,5,Excellent speakers! They put out a lot of sound for such a small footprint.
453,4,"This little device helps me get my gains at the gym without remundimg me it is in my pocket. Good reception with radio channels and holds all my music, around 400 songs worth. It's small and light so it doesnt get in my way.<br /><br />The only con is that there is no security. If someone steals it, they dont need a password or pin. That is why i gave this 4 stars."
454,5,"This clock radio is a great buy, it has wonderful features such as the time projection on a wall, temperature, day of the week, it even sets itself when you plung it up. I also like it because it is small and compact which fits nicely on my night stand."
455,5,This product is great for transfering your old cassettes to your computer.  It's hard to find something like it so easy to use.
456,3,"We purchased this speaker because our TV is in a large room and the tv sound volume was quite low and a little muffled.  The Bose speaker definitely clears up and enhances the sound, but I expected a little fuller sound from it.  We had been to the Bose store and listened to the speakers the sound was much fuller.  I understand that this is last years model, but Bose speakers have always been famous for their big sound.  Bottom line, we are a little disappointed with this product, but will continue to use it and watch movies on our tv with surround sound."
457,5,Mount to RV bedroom TV
458,5,Great center channel
459,5,It did not meet my my expectations it far exceeded them.
460,5,They are really ultra fire
461,1,"This player would play 4 tracks, and then just stop... tried to get it fixed,but couldnt find anyone who would or could,so I gotangry and just threw it away... I'm not very happy..."
462,5,"After reading all the reviews we chose this bar. Sets up easy and sounds good. Anything would sound good compared to the TV speakers. The bass response is pretty cool. So good, in fact, it bothers my wife's sensitivity to low end frequencies. The side throw feature does make a difference. If the bar is within the cabinet space and you pull out the slider the TV is on and the speakers get into the open air, you can hear the difference. Not true surround but, nice just the same for the price. Even though we watch music DVD's through it and they sound good I don't care for playing CDs through the system for some reason. The sound is too tinny. Adding bass response just tends to muddy the waters. For things on the TV it's really nice, though."
463,5,Very good sound and comparable to my Bose earbuds.
464,1,"In a room with good WiFi coverage itmuch more often than not fails to connect to the internet radio and ends up sounding the alarm as a backup.  So it's about as effected as a $15 alarm clock while costing 10x as much.  Either buy the $15 alarm clock or try and find something else (I've got the Sagaen wfr-28 which works almost all of the time; the user interface is awful but once set up it seems to work), although there doesn't seem to be a really solid product out there."
465,1,Broke before it could ever be used.
466,5,Does what it needs to.
467,5,This item is being used to control 120mm x 38mm delta fans.  The fans are too loud at  12 volts.  I feed 12 volts into  this device lower the output to 10 volts.  The delta fans are quieter  which is a good thing.  What makes this nice it the ability it has to handle 100 watts.  That is more then enough to run 6-8 delta fans with 0 issues.  Pc/fan controller normally ca do 40-60 watts and cost 2x the price of this device.  I estimate  I can do 2x the the fans at 1/2 the cost. I did need to splice a few wires to do this but that is pretty easy to do.
468,5,"Needed utube video to get the old ones off and install the new ones.  Other than that, super."
469,1,I had to return this item: I received worse reception while using the amplifier than without using it!
470,5,Works good
471,1,didnt work until now
472,5,Awsome
473,5,"Perfect, just what i was looking for"
474,5,"Had some initial problems but with their help I was able to get both iPhones working, just as advertized.  Some points, or learning from the errors I made.  1.  When paring the second iPhone have the first one turned off or while the first phone is far enough away that the Renny does not 'see' it.  2.  Do not attempt to test the unit from one of the paired phone.  Or, said another way, don't use phone one to call phone two to test.  Have someone call each of the phones or if you still have a land line use it to test.  I used my Skype account to test and all went well.  Looking forward to great service.  Thanks to Olens Technology for the tech. follow-up.  It was great!"
475,5,Works as expected and as it should.
476,5,It works.
477,5,"Gave this sleek little clock to my daughter as a gift for the holidays.  Nice price, features and quality.  She really likes it."
478,5,"I'm in love with this speaker. The feel, the size, everything. The sound quality is clear, connection is easy and range sturdy. I'm sad I can't give it more stars."
479,5,"Pros:<br />- Excellent noise cancelling.  I use these when I'm on a rowing machine, and the earphones manage to cancel out most of the drone.<br />- Low &#34;pressure feeling&#34;.  Earlier noise cancelling earphones that I have tried all seemed to create a sense of pressure in my ears which I found uncomfortable.  Although there is a slight feeling of pressure with this model, it is low enough that it rarely bothers me.<br />- Very comfortable.<br />- As noise cancelling headphones go, I think the sound quality is very good.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- They come with that three-section plug you often find with Apple products.  It works fine on most regular equipment, but I've found some that don't work well without you needing to continually wiggle the plug around, and even then sometimes you lose stereo.  I wish they would stop using this plug it drives me nuts.<br />- My experience with the battery is that it lasts a bit less than they say.  For me, a Duracell AAA lasts maybe 16-20 hours."
480,4,Cord could be just a bit longer.
481,5,Gave to grandsons for christmas and they love it.
482,3,"I like this little dude. That being said, here is my tale.<br />So I drive an old SUV. The radio went bad, so I went to replace it. Spent 3 days, found some bad wires, and gave up. ( Authors note, I am not a mechanic.) So I drove around using the tinny speaker in my phone. Awful. I enjoy music far too much to try and survive on that alone. So I did some research on Bluetooth speakers. This, and one other popped up as good and cheap. So I went for this one. I don't regret it. That being said, it  has its limitations. Sound is good to great, battery life is good to great, but its not as loud as I would like it traveling down the highway. I do use it a bit at home like when I am in the shower or getting ready for work, that sound is great. Doing 45 down the road in traffic, not the greatest. I still hear it fine, but wanting to blast it, I don't get that option. I still like the little dude, and that is good enough for me."
483,3,"12/14  Original post -Checked the voltage of the battery before installing it, reading was 13 volts, well above the nominal voltage of 12 volts, a good sign the battery is fresh and in good health.  If your battery shows up below 12 volts that's not a good sign.<br /><br />9/16  Editing my review - Battery failed after 20 months.  The Texas heat is hard on Lead/Acid batteries, but I was hoping for at least 3 years.  I don't recommend this one because of the short life.  Will go with a different brand."
484,2,"I am using this male to male auxiliary cord in a car. it fits snug even with a hefty case on my phone.  Braided cables rock. They are tangle resistant and more sturdy. I am slowly switching my frequently used devices over to them.  Update: after little more than a year of daily use, the cable no longer works. Audio was muffled on the right side but clear on the left. I'm disappointed with the amount of use I got from this."
485,5,Works great.  Sturdy and secure for a very heavy flat screen!
486,5,Love it. Still using it on my Bose Docking station. My wife still uses iPhone 4 and i use it for my iPad as well. I bought an adapter for my iPhone 5 and it still works. The only thing is the control has limitted function to my iPhone 5. But that is not because of the new features of iPhone 5 and 5s.
487,2,The rubber piece hurt my ears.
488,4,Great sound
489,5,Great sound and very comfortable to wear I liked them so well that I bought a second pair for my wife so she will stop taking mine!
490,5,"Amazing battery life, pairs easy / well with all devices and a extraordinary range of sound (lows, mids and highs).  This headset is a must buy for the price."
491,5,"I love these headphones! While they don't block out all the outside noise, I love that I am able to sleep with these on and be distracted by whatever it is I am listening to. I am able to sleep on my side with no problem. There is a lot of construction going on in my neighborhood right now and these headphones have been a Godsend!"
492,5,"Very Nice Item. I like the quality sound. I really like this bluetooth box, and it does everything as described by the seller.<br />Thank you."
493,5,So far so good! They feel great and sound great! Feels like quality.
494,5,Great sound!  Use these at the office with my laptop.  Tried to get a set of Bluetooth headphones (so I wouldn't be &#34;tethered&#34; to the laptop) but they didn't work.  Went back to these - solid and dependable.
495,1,Does not work
496,3,"Not shielded, so it's too long to produce a signal without noise, unles if you use an amplifer."
497,5,works great on my 05 tacoma
498,5,Excellent product.  This allowed me to move my dresser closer to the wall so it's not awkwardly sticking out. Wish I had found out about these earlier.
499,5,the best speaker i ever owned
500,4,Sounds great
501,5,excellent product
502,5,good deal
503,4,Really useful.  Sound is excellent especially if connected to a good external sound system.
504,5,Has a very convenient option to hang on the wall although it is very large.
505,5,Delivered extremely fast and accurate
506,5,"Awesome loud ,good bluetooth system and awesome battery life"
507,5,5 stars.. excellent..
508,4,your product meets my needs at this time however i will need more time to fully rate it
509,5,Great for the price
510,3,"It works, i guess. The thing is that the sound does not work properly when i plug my headphones in. You have to twist it and take it out just enough (for mine) to find the right &#34;spot&#34; for the sound to be normal. Basically, mine was defective, but it works enough for my purposes, so i'm ok with it."
511,5,Works perfectly
512,5,"After trying at least 5 other antennas, this one worked for me. I also found a terk that worked almost as good. The problem for me is that I live in a very hilly area that has plenty of residential areas about 13 miles away from tv towers. After hooking it up I got a decent signal right away, but not all channels I wanted. I rescanned and immediately had better signal quality"
513,5,"Take the time to try out the different ear buds included until you find what is most comfortable for you.  The ship with 6 different pairs of earbuds so you should find something that you like.  The sound is clear, I use these while working out or watching shows on my tablet during breaks at work.  I also like the fact they have a microphone on the right earbud and has functions to take and make calls through the headset."
514,5,worked as advertised.
515,5,"Perfect....I used this for my ROKU, my stand is blocking the HDMI entry, and these made it possible to still connect. Nice!"
516,5,great price
517,3,It not good at all
518,5,This is a great cable to use to plat music from your device. The ends on the cord are tapered to fit into smaller spaces because of bulky phone cases. It just plugs right in no problem. Highly recommended.
519,4,Space saving for all those DVDs that crowded the shelves in their individual cases.
520,5,So easy and works so well.  We can control it through 2 floors and works great!
521,5,2nd time I've gotten these. Love how long they last in my low-power devices (eg tiny MP3 player) and higher power ones (eg my shaver).
522,5,"I am truly amazed at the reception this little radio gets. I bought it because I like radios and wanted one to listen to around the house or in the park or at the ballgame. I loved the price and took a chance on it based on the reviews. Where I live, I get amazing reception. I am extremely impressed with the quality and price of this radio."
523,4,My daughter loved it
524,5,"This surround sound system is the perfect thing for my dorm room. The price was great and the sound is fantastic! I ordered 16AWG Speaker Wire to replace the standard wire that came with it, and I would recommend you do that. The wire is short and puny.<br /><br />The system puts out awesome theatrics and I love to use it for movies! It is also great for just listening to music. The many buttons on the Receiver allow it to play through many different modes. The usb port also charges the device while playing, which is a nice commodity.<br /><br />Makes my dorm hall shake, and people come knocking on my door if they can hear it from the fourth floor (I'm on the 1st).<br /><br />Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase. Everything was in the box and the package got here pretty fast."
525,4,So far so good. Ears get a little hot but that's it
526,1,These headphones are absolute garbage. The power button was barely working new out of the box.....within 3 weeks completely broken... I opened the headphones to try and fix and found terrible engineering inside.....flimsy internal parts that clearly show these are nothing more that temporary headphones....threw them in the trash.
527,4,"Fits the Beats speaker nicely. It's a bit generic, but it works."
528,5,Great sound.  Easy bluetooth setup.  Bose never disappoints.
529,5,"Very Solid Construction Cable, Quality is also great to mention and of curse Performance as expected."
530,1,"THIS ANTENNA IS THE WORST PIECE OF CRAP I HAVE EVER SEEN. THE COMPANY THAT SELLS IT IS ROBBING PEOPLE. I THINK IT MIGHT WORK IF YOU LIVED WITHIN 5 MILES OF THE TOWER, BUT ALL I GOT WAS SNOW, OR NOTHING, AND I LIVE 30 MILES FROM THE TOWER IN NYC, AT THE NEW WORLD TRADE CENTER. THEY ARE THIEVES. A COMPLETE WASTE OF MY TIME AND AMAZONS'"
531,4,"First bulb was received, but bulb shattered.  No package damage and packing was not issue, just nature of beast, unfortunately...no problems returning at no cost and re-ordered replacement bulb from same place, prime shipping so, as usual, no problems there...installed new bulb in TV...picture now nice and bright again, good to go for another 3 or 4 years hopefully...as usual AMAZON rocks!!!"
532,4,"Nice product.  Works as advertised.  Don't expect the deep and rich audio fidelity of a high end boom box like a Bose.  But for the money, this is a very versatile good sounding system that will play music from multiple input types, and not just Apple devices."
533,5,Fantastic.  Makes connections so much easier.
534,5,I love this when i travel!
535,3,They work as advertised but the RCA &#34;shield&#34; is too thin.  It bends and breaks too easily.
536,5,I know dr. dre beats are the cool headphones but for my 10 and 12 year old girls these fit them better.  Noise Canceling is good per my husband but not as good as his bose but for this price pretty darn good!!  Easy to use...only took our kids a few minutes to get used to them....no more wires!!!
537,5,This is a simple item to review. It was delivered on time and works just as it should.
538,3,"For $15 not bad, but most of these reviews are very deceiving. When I got them I was excited thinking they were going to have a good bass and be loud. They arent...they are pretty quiet and they don't have much bass."
539,5,Exactly as advertised and a great buy.
540,4,love it
541,5,"I have abused this thing for 4 years now. I bought it for use when camping before I had a smartphone, and now I keep it in a toolbox in the trunk of my car. It has been dropped many times and still works great."
542,5,Love my &#34;TD Bank&#34; bumbster by origaudio. easy to use. very loud if I want it loud. Great sound. Perfect. compact. Absolutely great.
543,4,Only two discs out of the 50 were faulty so that's a pretty good ratio. Much better than all other brands I have used over the years.
544,5,"I bought this waterproof iPod to swim laps at the local YMCA. WOW! Am I ever glad I got it. It makes the laps seem to go by so much faster. The audio quality is excellent. I have been swimming with it at least 3 times a week for the last 2 months (an hour each time I swim) and I love it. Ivan at Swim Audio answered the question I had very quickly. Excellent customer service. All Amazon vendors should be this good! If you swim, this little iPod is for you. Makes my work out so much more enjoyable! Get it!"
545,5,These spacers are great for use with eneloop AA batteries. These are better then my older set and actually have a solid negative end and allow me to use them in my D cell mag lites without adding a penny to make contact with the spring. Fantastic improvement.
546,5,"Both bass and treble are very strong for the price and weight, and there is a surprising amount of passive noise reduction given that the earpieces don't cup the ears. I may be mistaken, but the excellent sound quality seems just as good with Bluetooth as with the wired connection. The headset is quite light weight.<br />The earpieces seem to press a bit tightly against my ears, but not too uncomfortable. Being unable to charge with a 110 - 5 volt charger is a little inconvenient.<br />I don't like in-the-ear inserts while working out, so these will do fine."
547,5,Really good for noise isolation.. sounds good also
548,4,Love the sound and the sound-isolating effect. They're a little bigger than I imagined but that's okay.
549,5,I love monster products my second one
550,4,"I am not sure if it is the cable or my dad's HDMI port (the TV has been through quite a bit) but it gets disconnected randomly, stops playing volume randomly, etc. However, when it works, it works well! It is definitely worth all of the trouble. I love having the option of playing my games on the big screen."
551,4,Quite useful
552,3,the sound is okay and they don't stay on all the time while working out.
553,3,Air play cuts off in its own.
554,5,This is an exceptional center speaker for the price and size.  I was comparing this and a similar form Yamaha and decided to go with the Polk and I can't imagine the Yamaha or any other speaker of this size performing noticeably better for a small/medium room surround system.
555,5,My Son was very happy with this Christmas morning.
556,5,No problems. Works great.
557,5,Bought this speaker for my Mom for Christmas and she loved it.  Great sound for a little speaker!
558,5,good
559,3,Direct Replacement for bad dual switch.
560,1,Lasted less than 3 months. Complete garbage.
561,5,"I paid less than 2 dollars and I have 10 disposable pairs of glasses, how cool is that?"
562,1,"The suction cup lost suction and the speaker fell off the wall.  Broken after only one use.  You'd think the manufacturer would test the product to withstand a fall.  I guess they didn't.  The speaker sounds great, but since I was only able to use it once, I'm giving it 1 star.  Very disappointed."
563,5,I received this from my son as a christmas present. I have been looking for a wireless speaker that is durable as I have a workshop where things can get dirty very quickly. Not only is it very rugged and seems like it can withstand about anything ... the sound is great! Can't believe how clear and loud the sound is for how portable it is... Very easy to use out of the box. Bluetooth connectivity is strong. Highly recommend.
564,5,Good
565,5,"Excellent tone, charges my iphone and can wake to radio, buzzer or iphone music. Highly recommend."
566,5,Good quality - perfect.
567,5,Good price and it fits perfectly...good product to protect Oontz Angle.  Even has room for cables because it stretches.😃
568,5,"Great sound, great price. Happy with the purchase!"
569,5,very good sound
570,5,Sound quality is amazing. Easy hook up
571,1,Does not fit my cell as indicated in the advertisement
572,5,this is working out great
573,3,"The batteries and charger came very quickly. The batteries work great, but the charger is bad. The charger came melted under one of the terminals. It looks as if someone else had this charger and it was repacked as new. It would cost more to send it back, so I am not going to mess with it. I'm giving 3 stars because of the defective battery charger."
574,5,"So handy, USB phone and device chargers are pretty standard, installs just like a regular outlet. Is not gfi protected so be aware if using in a kitchen. Put it in line, not as the primary receptacle."
575,4,Very good!
576,4,Seems to work fine.  Needed an extra one so now I have four spares.  Lighter than normal.
577,5,"This product is a life saver! Why my 50&#34; Samsung TV only has one HDMI port is a mystery, but this product works great! If you need an HDMI 3 way splitter you cant go wrong with this one. And, if you get that infamous &#34;HDCP support handshake&#34; message on your connection, follow thw troubleshooting instructions EXACTLY and problem solved!"
578,5,Battery is what was required.  Decent battery life.
579,3,A little weak if your TV is heavier.
580,4,Use this to hook into reciver for playing music from my phone.
581,5,Audiophiles will not be disappointed.
582,5,My girlfriend works grave-yard shifts for law enforcement and I use these during the morning hours while she is sleeping - works great!
583,4,Pretty good for the price.  Way better at recording conversations than I expected. Menu to navigate to audio book chapters needs improvement.
584,3,"Great price, but it not very bright. Had some issues with it already but still working. I hope it lasts long or it is not worth it."
585,5,"Works as advertised, and is a quality cable."
586,5,Tried them last night and they work very well for such a simple device. A bit expense for what you get but I made the choice and they do work well. Be aware that I got a little nauseous playing with the VR apps but that's just me.
587,5,"fast delivery; product works and charges, but the power drains FAST from the tablet, most likely due to the cyanogen mod...if you have the chance, don't buy this tablet."
588,5,"This is pretty long for HDMI, but picture is still clean as it was with a 1 meter cable."
589,5,Good dvds.  Seldom any coasters with this product usage in three different machines
590,4,"It arrived on time and well packaged. However, since it is a Christmas gift I cannot tell you if there are problems with it.<br /><br />Thanks."
591,5,"I purchased this 2-pack of 10-foot HDMI extension cables for use with an Amazon FIRE STICK.  Although I only needed one extension cable, this 2-pack was a better deal, so I have one cable spare.  I plugged one end into the HDMI input on my television and then plugged the FIRE STICK into the female end, and now I can reposition my FIRE STICK for better wi-fi reception than when plugged directly into the television. The longer cable makes this possible.  I have not experienced any dropped picture or sound; it works flawlessly. I've purchased other Cable Matters cables in the past and have always found them to be high quality but reasonably priced. Recommended."
592,1,"They were my favorite ear buds. They were comfortable, good mic, and great for no tangles. Notice how I kept saying &#34;were&#34;.  My daily use was simple wake up get dressed for work, put the ear buds in my pocket go to work and user sporadically throughout the day. Come home occasionally go to the gym and sometimes use them as I handle things around the house.<br /><br />  First the mic stopped working, next the whole right ear bud was dead. I really liked these ear buds however simply put they do not last.<br /><br />I can get a twenty dollar pair that will last longer then these did. Because of this there is a 1 Star. I don't know if it is just an isolated incident however I won't buy another pair to find out."
593,5,Good!
594,5,Very happy with items. Received as advertised.
595,5,Best fit I've ever had wit an ear bud period!
596,5,"Arrive quickly. Great capacity, great shelf life.  What else could you want a battery."
597,5,"Second one I have purchased, love it and was easy to set up."
598,4,Very cheap but uncomfortable
599,3,"It works okay, but not as well as I had hoped (or presented).  It needs to be moved around to capture a signal.  It sometimes works very well, at other time, not well at all.  As a serious cable-cutter, I am looking already looking for an upgrade."
600,5,Gotit fast just as described
601,4,Good product. Had to download the instructions since they did not arrive with the product but other than that works great.
602,3,"I was disappointed with the sound quality of these headphones. They fit nicely and the noise reduction is great, but I feel like the sound lacks bass and clarity. I guess the value is the weather resistance with these headphones but if you're looking for excellent sound as I was, I would recommend a different product."
603,4,I was skeptical about buying these based on some of the reviews but I bought them anyway and I gotta say I'm not mad. Sound great. Not Beats or Monster but not far off. People said they were tight but they fit me great. Must've had a big head. Built well too. We'll satisfied for $30..
604,5,Son loves!
605,5,worked great
606,5,great
607,1,"I must say I was all in on buying these speakers when it dawned on me how could they not include the water ? Totally disappointed I decided maybe go for it all so I purchased these babys for 238,000 http://www.amazon.com/M-Audio-Studiophile-Active-Monitor-Speakers/dp/B0051WAM64/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1418339390&sr=1-2&keywords=speakers&pebp=1418339398913 . I included pics of the new house but sorry to say at the time of this posting the speakers are neatly wrapped in boxes so you wont get to see them in action.    [...]"
608,1,"It was less effort to just buy a new TV.  The quality of the picture was terrible even with all the recommendations, which were tedious"
609,5,Perfect for the senior citizen in your life.
610,5,"This desk is exactly what I expected. It was very easy to assemble. It appears to be very sturdy and the glass is beautiful. It's quite spacious for its size. My 27\\"" monitor fits nicely. My favorite part is the keyboard tray which has enough space for my keyboard (17 3/4\\"" wide) and a 9\\"" mousepad with another 3/4\\"" of space to spare. It's the sturdiest keyboard tray I've ever had. It doesn't feel like it would fall apart like most keyboard trays I've seen. I did accidentally kick off the little \\""Bell'O\\"" logo on the bottom of the right front leg of the desk but that's easily glued back. I'm very happy with this purchase. I highly recommend it for anyone in need of a smaller desk."
611,2,"Great headphones, but the actual rubber part that goes in your ear makes awfully annoying noises when using them while active - even the slightest movement makes a noise"
612,2,Returned my 3rd pair and will never buy them again!
613,3,first off they are not over ear they are on ear now this will make you scratch head but it is important there is only 1 cable going to these headphones and it goes on the RIGHT ear cup do not be stupid like me i tried using a lot of diffrent cables to get the sound right i do not trust marley cables then a droped them in my lap and saw the R is where the cable input. i am not stupid and have made close to 200 purchases from AMAZON most all of them are head phones i have only seen 1 set that the cable was on the R they where AKG's Quincy Jones.  Okay back to the review great base mids and highs but they are round and they make my ear hurt if you are going to make on ear phones the need to be oval or rectangle these are round.
614,2,Got these as a gift.... poor QC broke almost 4 months in Klipsch is is not what it used to be..... If you want a GREAT set of headphones look at a brand I recently found called Final Audio stay away from this brand! I'd hate for anyone else to get suckered into spending top dollar on a TRASH product.
615,5,I bought one for my Daughter at the T-Mobile store last year and it is her favorite!
616,5,really good so far but the bluetooth not good.
617,5,"These things are amazing. Used in an E Cig and last about 3 days. I consider myself a heavy user using a 1.7 ohm coil at 11 watts. Had two in the past. One only lasted about 9-12 months, the other has lasted like 18-20 months and still working strong."
618,5,RELIABLE RECHARGABLE BATTERIES AT A FAIR PRICE.
619,4,aaa
620,5,Worked great out of the box
621,5,good product
622,5,Great price and it was shipped right away.
623,5,"Not much to say about this one. It works great, was the length advertised, no issues found."
624,5,"Good disc,s very few ash trays if any."
625,5,"I received this USB Hub a while back. Let me tell you, IT WORKS! Its great when you have only about one or two USB ports in your laptop or desktop PC and you need more for whatever your doing. Let me say that it does connect to your computer fine and you wont have any trouble installing any drivers (Only takes a minute or two). And for a few people who are wondering if it works on the PS4, it does. So you will be able to charge and do many other things which I found to be awesome! I also like the fact that you can turn it on and off so it's not always using power. So all in all I did fine this to be a great product!<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Easy Setup<br />- Great for Multiple USB Devices<br />- Works on PS4<br />- Power Button<br />- No loss in speed from mouse or keyboard when many USB devices are in use (Which I was worried about)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- A little to light. With a bunch of cable going in other directions sometimes it will flop around. But not a huge deal :D"
626,1,"Absolutely terrible product. First, I had to take parts off the other antenna (there were parts missing) to make a good one.... so I thought. When I FINALLY got the one antenna together, after making some minor modifications to some parts, mounted it on my roof and plugged it in.... the darn thing (being nice) didn't work. The motor did not rotate and the antenna only picked up three channels (that weren't even good). I'm very disappointed with this product and this purchase. I have to eat the $60 I paid for the two antennas."
627,1,"Pops, Static, and all sorts of interference just ten feet away. If the speaker wire gets anywhere near the power, the feedback and static is terrible. Even moving the power to an outlet not near the speakers still has a lot of pops and static whenever the signal changes or the power turns on or off. Not worth the money."
628,5,"Very nice kit. I truthfully did not notice the extra bits that come with it, and they certainly increase the value of the kit. MotherInLaw usually needs more hdmi cables than she has and locally only very expensive ones are available.<br /><br />Came in a nice box with easy to read and understand description of contents."
629,5,Love this. It is simple and just what I need!
630,5,"Good Buy, great deal, come with cable tightener as well."
631,2,I thought this would hide all the wires but I can't put the power cord through it because it's a fire hazard :/
632,4,Just what I ordered.
633,5,Love Philips Bulbs.they last a long time
634,5,Works wonder!!!
635,5,I highly recommend this product.
636,5,works
637,5,great sound for small item
638,5,"Affordable, well made, and they work. What more could you ask for."
639,1,Bluetooth Fail.<br /><br />Crackles and breaks up (as others have noted)  playing music from my Google Nexus 4 phone. Will send it back and try something else.
640,5,exactly what I needed does the job.
641,1,"I really wanted to like this soundbar since I know Yamaha makes good audio.  However this soundbar leaves a lot to be desired.  The highs are harsh and not smooth.  The bass is really midbass thumping and not any low end bass.  My Bose Soundlink mini puts out better bass than this soundbar and its hardly one fifth the size.  This also has no bluetooth!  This is going back, I've ordered the Polk IHT5000 in its place and will review it once I have that setup.    ***UPDATE***  I got the Polk IHT5000 and compared it head to head to this Yamaha.  The Polk's sound quality was far superior. The difference in sound quality was night and day with the Polk's highs being pleasant, and not aggressively harsh.  Bass on the Polk was also supeior with its dedicated subwoofer; the bass going much lower and no midbass distortion as with the Yamaha.  Being so inferior to the Polk I removed an additional star bringing down to a one star rating."
642,1,returned it
643,5,love this roku box. everyone should have one of these in their house
644,5,Awesome.
645,5,Works great and the sound quality is enhanced . it is well made and the 2.5 mm connects tight with my headphone and the 3.5mm connects tight to my Samsung note 3 where I have my music.<br />Works great.
646,4,"It sounds good and is very useful with my iPod 5.  I have a case on my iPod, and while the iPod with case goes into the opening of this speaker dock OK, getting it onto the Lighting connector takes some retries.  Sometimes the Lighting plug on the dock doesn't go into the Lightning connection on the iPod but in between the iPod and it's plastic case.  I'm an engineer and I do it carefully, but it still requires careful thought.  You can tell if it's on correctly because the iPod will ding after a second and the screen will say &#34;charging&#34; or &#34;100% charged&#34; if the connection was made correctly.  Also, if the Lighting plug on the dock went in between the iPod and its case, the unit can be made to slide sideways, indicating that it isn't in the Lighting connector of the iPod.<br />I use it to play my iPod &#34;out loud&#34;, albeit only in monoaural.  (This matter when listening to music like Pandora.)"
647,3,"No instructions, at all.  So still trying to figure out how to wire it.  So still not working, but it was shipped quickly."
648,5,Got it on time and Love it...
649,3,"Cannot say if the cable is good or not. It did not fit into my sound bar. Their is no flexibility in the ends. But if you have a A/V system, try it out. It is quite hefty and seems to be a high quality cable for the money. I ditched my A/V system when I bought my sound bar."
650,1,Did not work converting HDMI for my cable tv.
651,5,Best Creative product ever!  I wish they still carried this product.  I have one base unit and 5 satellite receivers with my own  speakers at each of the 6 locations within my home and rear patio area. This wireless music system runs circles around bluetooth wireless audio devices. This unit provides true CD audiophile quality sound.
652,1,returned-no RCA plugs for my hearing aids
653,4,Sony is a good product
654,3,Very nice hooks but I didn't get to use them cause the earpiece fit good without the hook but the hook does help when your doing something active
655,5,"Excellent mount! I have a 32&#34; Samsung LED tv on it which is really light. The mount is easy to articulate and does not sag (at least with this TV). It comes with several nice little accessories that are very useful (wiping cloth, HDMI, LED keychain light, level).<br /><br />My only gripe is that on the back there is a minor clearance issue when the TV is angled downward so that the arm contacts itself and knocks out on of the plastic covers. Not a big deal and is hidden so not worth losing a star."
656,5,"I only have two sets of RCA cables in the splitter at the moment, but this thing is perfect as I plan on adding retro game consoles to it in my game room. It does its job well."
657,5,We stream a lot of movies on an iPad when on vacation and this makes for a great movie experience.  I also hook it to my iMac at home for iTunes and it ROCKS for such a small unit.
658,4,Rather load ticking.
659,2,"First of all, I can't believe this is being sold for so much on amazon. I bought this for $1 at Target about a year ago. Anyway, when I saw it, I thought it was a great idea and I bought a few of them. They fit perfect on my Apple earbuds (I have the older version). The size of the wrapster is just enough to let the microphone area lie flat. However, they do not fit my Samsung earbuds. The dimensions just do not let the microphone area lie flat. It also is not strong enough to be used as a stand on my Samsung galaxy S4. This thing really is designed for iphones, which they should have specified on the package.    I can deal with those issues but what I can't deal with is the fact that it messed up my headphones! Since you have to push the earbuds down into the crevice, the bottom part gets pushed up and ripped. I've added two pictures to my review because it'll show you what I mean better than I can explain it. My earbuds were in perfect condition before I started using the wrapster so obviously I am upset. The bottom part of the earbuds (the gray part below where it says R or L) has mushroomed up and is all ripped. I will no longer be using the quirky wrapster and I do not suggest it to anyone else anymore.    So all in all, it was a great idea but I believe it has poor execution."
660,5,"Works great , nice price ' quick delivery'  I would recommend this to anyone who needs an antenna extention"
661,3,"Not 100 happy with this, my first unit was faulty, free week of frustration thanks SONY. The second unit works as it should. The bluetooth hooks up quickly and sounds good. Playing DVD's on the movie setting gives plenty of clarity and power. My main niggle is that there is no sub output when playing 2 channel music (thats the rest of the world, apparently the North American model does do this) why? Does only Americans and Canadians like listening to 2 channel music with a powered sub? Seriously SONY thats pretty stupid, so to get the sub to play I have to use the Portable music sound field, which is ok most of the time because I play compressed files. But I would quite like to pump some tunes from CD, 2 channel, with my sub. I must be some sort of weirdo."
662,3,I am 65 miles away from my favorite FM station. Some days it doesn't come in well. Tried this Bose  antenna in hopes that reception would improve. It didn't. It is about the same as moving the power cord around.
663,1,Look closely at shipping(free).but 45days never again.
664,5,I have owned several Bluetooth speakers - this one is awesome. It gets more than loud enough - has decent bass response and the battery lasts a really long time. Also I can charge my phone and use this speaker at the same time with the USB port on the side. I get compliments at the poolside because of the great sound it produces. If anything ever happens to the speaker - I will be buying another one without hesitation.
665,2,unfortunately they did not stand up to my expectations
666,5,"Works very well, the powered antenna boosted the signal and I was able to get channels from the next major city away along with my local channels."
667,2,Battery life is short.  Substandard to Plantronics Voyager Edge in every way.
668,4,easy and good value for the price
669,1,LIE!! This is NOT a CONVERTER even though the title says that. Do NOT buy if you need a converter!!!!
670,5,very good headphones.
671,5,Great buy. I bought 2.
672,5,I have had a 40&#34; Emerson flat screen hanging on this for 3 years now and it is sturdy as a rock. The house is well over 60 years old and the wall it hangs on was re-done in the late 80's. The tilt feature is great and it is very easy to install.
673,5,"Works like a charm.  I have a 27' iMac with one of these brackets holding a 22' monitor on either side.  Looks good and lifts the monitors off the desk nicely, recovering some useable space.  I was worried that the size of the 'feet' on these would look silly, but they look fine to me in person.<br /><br />Have used for about 6 months with no issues."
674,4,"Same quality as OEM but not the price, Plug and play... Actually seems better constructed than my last replacement lamp...and less than half the cost. but just a few years ago even a generic lamp was $200.<br />the -1 star is because it does not come with replacement air filters and a dirty air filters increase the temp of the lamp and leads to premature failure.  Though in my usage and experience I have only had to clean the filter every couple hundred hours and replaced  once and that was just  precautionary when changing the lamp last time, Depending on environment it could be an issue...."
675,1,Product arrived damaged person without discernment will not notice any fault
676,3,"they're nice but they don't fit because I purchased the wrong ones.  I think my son can use them, so they aren't going back."
677,4,"Great build quality. Feels a little loose when plugged into various electronics. Used for in-wall and attic transmission of images from an NVR and A/V receiver to the TV. So far, no problems with signal quality at all."
678,4,I bought this radio for my husband and he thinks it is great.  The sound quality and price point is very good.
679,4,Really very nice. Good value for the money.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Paul
680,5,"A well-made product for use in protecting your electronic equipment from electrical surges, either man made or nature imposed."
681,1,It didn't work underwater at all. Very disappointed.
682,5,"Can't wait until she opens it, will update this later."
683,4,"Sound is much better than I expected with this little guy.  The bass especially is impressive.  My main complaints (why I gave it a 4 instead of 5) was that I have to remove my case each time I put it into the connector (I knew that already from previous reviews but it still is a pain) and that the plug to the outlet has an additional little adapter that you have to connect.  If you lose that, you are S.O.L...<br /><br />But overall, happy with the purchase."
684,4,my 10 year old loves these
685,4,"doesn't have the best swivel and turn radius, but item is great."
686,5,got this for my son who is in his late teens.  he listens to vinyl on it daily and is very pleased with the quality and the compact size.
687,4,seems to work well but I don't know enough about electronics or sound quality to give a good review. I have no complaints
688,5,"Since this is a famous brand, I believe on its quality. If there’s something wrong with the product in the short period of time, I really don’t worry since they offer limited lifetime warranty for a longer period of time."
689,5,awesome little box. s convenient and great sound
690,5,Works great easy to program
691,5,"Best small stereo system I've ever owned. Compact, clean style and big sound!"
692,5,Very good
693,5,"Great Product, Great Seller"
694,5,"I have a lot of headphones and have rediscovered these cans as one of my &#34;now&#34; fav's.  I listen to them through tube electronics and they present dynamics, coherence through the bass, mid, and treble frequencies...and are supremely comfortable to wear.  These cans are great with movie dynamics, also.  Sometimes...too great!"
695,4,Excellent but would be better as a binder.
696,5,"After deciding I wanted to reduce my tv viewing and also eliminate the expense of cable and DVRs, I did research on Amazon seeking a good way to receive at least the major network channels for news, etc. This antenna received high marks from a large number of reviewers, so I decided to try it out. It works great (I recently was able to watch The Roosevelts on PBS). I also bought one for my mother. A friend just bought one as well and is also happy with the purchase. I also bought a Roku device, which isn't bad, but if I had to choose between the two, I'd pick this antenna."
697,5,I found this remote for less than half of what the retail stores want for the exact same item. Set-up was a breeze with my Samsung tv guiding me to what codes to enter. It took about a minute and works great. Fast shipping as well.
698,5,"So comfortable, love them!"
699,2,having problems with it
700,5,Great product. Arrived fast and works as expected.
701,3,"This is nothing fancy, it does what it is suppose to do."
702,5,What can I say...does what it supposed to do.
703,4,"Great for travel - lets you share those rare power outlets on trains, planes, airports, etc.; works with an iPad and other devices that draw more amps.  With 2 3-prong outlets on one side and one on the other, it accommodates chunky power bricks easily and you can leave your other USB charging bricks at home.  We did have one of these blow on us during International travel, but we've had 3 others that continue to work well.  The only challenge is using them with international adapters, but you can solve this with an 8-12&#34; (or longer) extension cord (plug in the international adapter, the short extension cord, then the Outlets 2 Go).  Note:  this will NOT convert 220 to 110 or vice versa; you have to make sure your device or power brick is compatible with the volts coming out of the wall."
704,3,"The product was reasonably priced, arrived in good time and appears to be in excellent condition. I would give it 5 stars if I had used it. Alas, I purchased the wrong needle for my record player and can't use this one. Nobody's fault but mine."
705,5,"Very pricy, but way cool.  flip switch on earpiece and ambient sound disappears.  Granted they are not earplugs and you can still hear things, but very muffled and not once you put music on.  Nice carrying case, (better than any other Bose) and cord detaches from headset so not as big of issue with cord tearing as previous Bose I've had.  Sound is great.  We have lots of kids, I put them on when reading a book with a little rain or white noise on my iPod and it's like being in another world."
706,3,"I received the box with the lamp with a surprise because I thought that Philips made a sign or signature or a seal in all its products, and this lamp has no one. I installed it and it works. As simple as this."
707,5,Product was just as described and shipped when promised.
708,5,Great device. Cant be switched to English but its so intuitive it doesn't matter. Songs are displayed in English if thats how they are named.
709,5,Easy to use and works better than anticipated!
710,5,Love this product!!! Cuts down on a lot of space!
711,5,Great battery charger.
712,4,"Used with a Galaxy S5.<br /><br />Pros<br />+ Sound isolation is great for the price point.<br />+ Very comfortable, no problem wearing for extended periods of time.<br />+ Sound is pretty good generally. I'm not an audiophile, but I was impressed at $30.<br />+ The arm band is decent. Holds it in place, comfortable enough.<br />+ Greater wire weight means they don't tangle as much when you shove them in your pocket.<br /><br />Cons<br />- Because of the wrap around aspect, they're tough to just kind of intuitively slip in. I have to pay attention to which one is the right and the left, and then orient them properly, and then fidget with them to get the sound isolation to work.<br />- Because there is a wire coming down from top, sweat can slide down into your ear. Minor annoyance.<br />- I really don't like the extension cord. The female plug is large and gives the cord too much weight. With the extension, the cord is too long, without the extension it's too short for anything but use with the armband. Would have preferred somewhere in the middle with no extension.<br />- The remote is a little fidgety. Definitely have to slow down how fast I click compare to the native Samsung remote.<br /><br />On the whole, I like it, it's a good value at the price, but don't expect a world beater."
713,5,They're great for the price. Stylish sturdy and comfortable. SOund for conversatIons A's music excellent
714,5,"As advertised, delivered on time. Thanks!"
715,5,works well
716,5,"I bought this to bring as a back-up to drive-in movies. The speakers in my car are not loud enough to be heard well if we want to sit outside of the car, making us dependent on other cars' speakers. This little radio picked up the station better than most of the cars around us! Very clear reception.<br />I've had issue with it not recharging the batteries while plugged into the adapter, like it claimed to do, so I just make sure I use fully charged batteries."
717,3,Genéric nathing in special
718,4,Good quality for the money.  Looks nice.  Just what I needed.
719,3,none at this time.
720,5,Perfect remote for getting rid of all other remotes. The app feature is great for phone - Time consuming to set all electronics up.. but easy use!
721,4,"Very happy with this capsule speaker.  I bought it because my friend had gotten the next level down XBOOM.  It says ceramic, so I assumed it would be made of ceramics.  It's rubberized plastic just like the cheaper one, so Ill assume that the ceramic description has something to do with the inner workings of it.<br /><br />The sound is quite clear.  I use it with a mini-DVD player and my Kindle and the volume and base are perfect.  I also tend to knock it off the surface because I forget it is attached.  Falling 3 feet onto a carpet (and maybe smacking furniture) hasn't hurt it.  Nice.  Good for travel.  It twisted and compacts into an even smaller size like a turtle into a shell."
722,4,"The Harmony Home Control is remarkably easy to setup and works well as a powerful universal remote.  I was able to replace four remote controls with the Harmony Home Control and get rid of several cumbersome steps when changing devices.<br /><br />Using the Harmony app on my iPhone, I followed on-screen instructions for setting up the Harmony Home Control.  It asked me what devices I had connected to my TV.  I entered the model numbers for each and it immediately new what type of device it was and then suggested some activities like &#34;Watch TV&#34; and Watch Movies&#34;.  For each, it let me select the relevant devices and specify what inputs were required on my TV and on the sound system.  It even walks you through confirming that everything is working as expected.  I don't see how they could make the setup any easier.<br /><br />The remote is thinner than most remote controls and has a soft textured underside that makes it comfortable to hold.  Because the remote doesn't use IR technology, you don’t have to point it at your devices or even be in the same room to use it.  This is great if you're listening to the news from another room but want to turn up the sound or mute a commercial.<br /><br />Prior to the Harmony Home Control, switching inputs on my TV and sound system to go between my blu-ray player and DirecTV box took three remote controls and three steps.  Now I hit a single button on the Harmony and everything turns on and goes to the correct input.  I should have made this change a long time ago.<br /><br />Harmony has a feature on their current lineup of remotes where lesser-used functions like &#34;skip forward 30 seconds&#34; or &#34;chapter advance&#34; don't have dedicated buttons but rather require you to hold down a different button for a couple of seconds to trigger those actions.  In my mind, this is a reasonable compromise to keep the number of buttons downs.  You can download the Harmony application from myharmony.com and redefine how the buttons behave so you have a lot of flexibility if that matters to you.<br /><br />If it is important to you, you can also use the Harmony app to do pretty much everything you want from your phone.  I don't have much use for this because I don't want to have to unlock my phone go back to the Harmony app just to pause my show.<br /><br />There are a few negatives…<br /><br />To make room for the home automation buttons, Logitech shrunk the size of the numeric buttons to half the normal height. Those buttons are so small that they're almost unusable; I'm only able to click them with careful placement of my fingernail.  Other buttons are also reduced in size, though to a lesser extent.<br /><br />The layout is quite a bit different than my Harmony Ultimate remote which does make me have to adjust when I switch between TVs.  On the Harmony Ultimate, some buttons are positioned towards the top of the layout whereas the same buttons on the Harmony Home Control are towards the bottom of the remote.  Not a big deal, just pointing this out in case you own both.<br /><br />Although I have wifi-controlled lightbulbs and power outlets (wemo), Bluetooth locks (Kevo) and an Internet thermostat (Trane), none of my equipment works with the Harmony.  I hope Logitech increases their partnerships in the future to support some of these other brands.<br /><br />My biggest complaint about the Harmony Home Control is that after spending close to $150, you don't have a backlit remote.  In the dark, the remote control is mostly useless because you can't see the keys and you really can't feel your way around the remote either.<br /><br />Despite the lack of backlight and too-small keys, I'm overall happy with the Harmony Home Control.  If it had backlit keys, I would give it 5-stars.  So far it's worked perfectly.buttons behave so you have a lot of flexibility if that matters to you.<br /><br />If it is important to you, you can also use the Harmony app to do pretty much everything you want from your phone.

723,5,Good 50 ohm cable. Not for high power though. Fine for 200 watts or less. Connectors are well attached.
724,5,Installed this last year and it worked great. I would recommend to other amazon buyers.
725,5,work great
726,2,MATERIAL USED IS FOR HOLDING THE LEGS OUT IS FLIMSY WHICH IS THERE IS A WIND THE SATELLITE WILL LOSE ITS SIGNAL...
727,4,Great product. Works perfect with my homeserver. Easy to configure and setup. Best upgrade from my minuteman pro 500. I love all the features that come with it. Mostly used to keep my internet and wifi up during a power out and safely shut down my server to protect my data. Perfect for average home office user
728,5,"good quality, fast shipping."
729,5,"Great seller, product arrived right on time. Speaker works great; and was very easy to sync to my phone.  I have used the speaker every day since I have had it."
730,5,Couplers worked great. Fast delivery.
731,5,"No complaints, it is what it is. Recommend getting longer size, 6 ft. is rarely long enough!"
732,3,"Used it twice & then the sound has gone in the dvd area, strange it still plays the ipod sound<br />I bought it for the dvd purpose."
733,5,Okay
734,5,Works.  One port for mic other for head phones.  I'm too cheap... thrifty to bother buying a whole new usb or 3.5mm head set.
735,5,Perfect
736,5,works well
737,5,works great
738,4,Pretty good design but the quality of the sound it gives is pretty much normal. But i bought this for $49 which is fair enough.
739,5,love this thing! I had similar ones that did not last or work as well.  The battery on it is amazing - I use it every single day in the shower for 20 minutes and I rarely need to charge it. I also used it outdoors for a bonfire and the volume and clarity were good. For the price you really can't do better.
740,5,thumbs up
741,5,"Looked other places and this one was the best value,  instruction with cable was very helpful.  Cable came in bubble wrap and a seal box very well packaged."
742,5,EXCELLENT
743,1,"Fell apart after approximately six months with very little use.  These were a replacement for the exact same product which also stopped working after a few months of little use.  I thought I damaged the first earbud so bought this one.  After this one fell apart, past the return date, Amazon customer service credited me for both units.  Hooray for Amazon!  This is the reason I am a loyal Prime customer!!!!"
744,5,"I plugged it in, it works, and I haven't given it any more thought. That's everything I want from a cable."
745,5,"Arrived very fast, is huge, and easy to work with.<br /><br />Blacked out all light from the bedroom window  - YEY!!!"
746,1,"Horrible piece of JUNK!! Had many problems with this receiver right out of the box, I really wanted to believe that the problems were in my cable box or some other cause. So I kept it a few days longer than I should. I finally returned it to Amazon for a refund minus a restocking fee.<br />I'm out of over $40.00 but I am relieved to be rid of this Sony piece of junk!!<br />I purchased a Yamaha A740 and am very satisfied.... What a difference!!<br />Sony's reputation is going down the drain, too bad I used to be a fan!"
747,3,Very attractive radio-- but lightening plug  only usable with my 5s if I take off its case-- which is pretty thin. It is going back .
748,5,Great quality stand for my 21&#34; monitor and other stuff.  Simple and elegant.  Their customer service is the best!
749,5,Just what we wanted.
750,5,very good
751,4,"I get a lot of channels and clear picture,it was easy to install and looks better than rabbit ears!"
752,5,Some TV's can only get 720p but others work perfect.
753,3,"kinda tricky getting them just right.  I used them on some ear buds that didn't stay in my melon.<br /><br />Once they are set up, I think you are done.<br /><br />I gotta some apple ear buds that sound great but don't stay in so I will someday try this product on them"
754,5,Very good
755,3,"The switch works well, but the range of the remote is only about 6 feet."
756,4,It worked great for me
757,5,great little speaker and love the blue tooth with it!
758,3,"Pretty cool. Kind of a pain trying to get cover art together on that many songs. Was really easy to lose, and the last time I lost it I found it with the bottom of the screen cracked. Could see replacing the screen at some point."
759,3,"I'm on my third set of these in 8 years. (The first set lasted three years) They get used everyday, pretty much all day for the mic and iPhone answering at work and listening to podcasts or music while walking the dog in the evening.<br />  They've held up better than any other set (some much more $$$)  I've tried so far and when they've failed it's been my fault.<br />  The mic is near your jaw which I like and the volume control works well. For me I'd prefer a shorter cord.<br />  They make a near twin set that I don't like because the mic is down near your chest and the controls aren't as good.<br />  I wrap the wire over my ear to help keep them in place.<br />  I've tried other types, some of which may have sounded better but for what I do and need these have worked best for me."
760,1,not good
761,5,Very satisfied.  Not the best assembly instruction but the size and picture quality are great.
762,5,Work perfect :)
763,5,"Perfect, Perfect, Perfect! The best customer service I have ever had!!!!"
764,5,Awesome
765,4,"This is very helpful for my macbook air, it protects the macbook air from getting any scratches. Although the keyboard cover leaves marks on the screen after i close the macbook air."
766,4,only a couple of dead ones in the pack
767,3,does its job :)
768,4,work as advertised.
769,2,"This is your typical low price cheap banana post wall plate. The description is misleading as it would have you believe that this is actually gold plated...meaning real gold, but it's not. It's just cheap gold colored chrome plating. Description should be revised to read &#34;gold colored plating&#34;."
770,5,"Let me just start off by saying I never leave reviews. But after an excellent deal, and a personal thanks for purchase from the president of the business, I felt compelled to leave a review. Thank you Brian, I wish you many successes"
771,5,"I just love these KabelDirekt cables, I've bought a ton of different ones for my custom HTPC 'stereo' build; all of my 7.1 RCA component cables, subwoofer RCA cable, 3.5mm headset and mic extension cables, and an Optical S/PDIF cable are all KabelDirekt's and they work flawlessly.<br /><br />I love the metal jack housing area, not only do they look classy in the metallic black, but they are a LOT easier to plug in when you're reaching around behind a component in a tight space.  The cables themselves are sturdy and thicker than usual cables.  I've got a full 7.1 sound setup and I use one of the extension cables for my mic cause I sing, not a lick of signal loss."
772,3,Worked OK at first.  Then started rattling at higher levels.
773,3,"These are a decent pair of outdoor speakers for the price. Don't expect a lot of bass with these, as a 6.5-inch woofer isn't going to blow anyone away. I do find the highs/midrange frequencies seem overly harsh with these speakers. If you can, use an equalizer to tailor the frequency response of these speakers to your particular environment (as you should do anyway).<br /><br />The biggest problem I have with these speakers is that the mounting bracket and screws won't let you fully tighten the speakers down to a certain position, at least without putting in some washers. The screws are too long to ever make contact with the surface of the bracket unless you have something in between to make up for the space.<br /><br />Overall, if you're wanting a cheap outdoor speaker set for the patio or pool, these will fit the bill without costing you too much money. Just don't be expecting an acoustic masterpiece out of these speakers."
774,4,Hoping the Protector will do what I expect when the power surges - it happens too often here in South Fl. - not used to this since I am from NYC -my concern is that my devices will be safe from blowing.
775,5,"was as advertised, well pleased"
776,5,EXCELENTE
777,5,"Much improved over the already excellent QC15 and miles better than the Bose in-ear QC 20i which I also purchased recently. Less hiss, more noise isolation, better audio, more elegant design that fits better.  What's not to like?"
778,5,Prompt
779,5,works fine
780,1,Purchased the regular performance and regret it. Poor quality image and movement of the cable to the antenna causes the signal to worsen.
781,1,"I don't know if we recieved a defective one but this thing did not connect to a total of 2 iphones, 2 ipads or a laptop. After 100 repeated tries one of the devices would recognize the speaker and after tapping it to connect, we'd get a &#34;could not pair with device&#34; message. Completely didn't work. Returned it for a different speaker, hopefully the new one works."
782,5,My son loves them
783,5,This one really mounts slim. A good value!
784,1,"I bought 2 pair, and only  the right side worked on both pair"
785,4,I bought these to go with my new Denon AVR X1000 as the main frt speakers. The sound seems a little &#34;boxy&#34; to me but have yet to set them up properly. I will write more after my system is set up.
786,4,I worked exactly as expected. Used it to amplify a fixed audio out  on a tv to run only a set of ear bud headphones.
787,4,Works as described.
788,5,Works great!
789,1,"It looked cheap and hard to manage... Invest your money in some other brand, some brand dedicated for swimmers like Speedo."
790,5,Excellent
791,5,Great Speaker!!
792,5,"Very nice, easy to work with, color-coded wire really helps"
793,5,Good idea.
794,5,"I bought this after my brand new amazon-basics hdmi cord didnt work at all. This one works perfectly, and is very sturdy! I'm very happy with the purchase, and the price is great too."
795,5,Great sound quality for the price.  I bought one for my wife and son.  Both are pleased.  Easy to setup and connect to both Apple and Windows tablets.  Delivery was prompt with no issues
796,5,"This wireless Bluetooth speaker is tiny – but it is mighty!  I am really impressed with the sound it outputs and enjoy using it in my car as a way to listen to my music whenever and wherever I go.  I can also easily listen to my podcasts while on the go, so I feel like I am keeping current on world events and making a better use of my time!<br /><br />The Wireless Bluetooth Speaker from LuguLake is easy to use and even has speakerphone capability.  I find that to be a nice way for our girls to be able to chat with different family members on the phone since they can easily hear whoever it is without worrying about if they are holding the phone correctly (or securely!).<br /><br />My speaker is bright blue that I love!  It adds a pop of color to my car or wherever else I take it and I love that!  I think I'll pick up a few as stocking stuffers for sure!"
797,2,"Bought this because the (magnetic) plug that attaches to the tablet deteriorated and no longer worked. While the new charger was just fine at first, disappointingly, its cord already has already split, exposing inside wires where the wire meets the plug.<br />I'm going to try electrical tape, hoping to keep it going for awhile, but it seems as though some stress protection where wire meets the plug would be good. Don't have much confidence this will last very long.<br />See if you can find a better one."
798,5,"Concise clarity.  Used as main speakers; switching through AV multi-sound settings and the Cerwin Vega does wonders to music, media and gaming.  Very happy with my purchase."
799,4,I like it.
800,1,"I purchased two of these because the price was right. The door to insert the VHS-C tape wouldn't even open on the first one, so I tried the next. It initially functioned as it should. I was able to insert my tape and put the unit into my VHS player. The adapter made a loud buzzing noise as it played and skipped regularly. About halfway through my tape it quit running. I ejected the adapter and discovered it had eaten my tape!<br /><br />If you value your VHS-C tapes, don't buy one of these. Find motorized versions, which work just fine. I had one for 10+ years until my son fiddled with it and broke it. Regretfully, I took a chance on one of these manual jobs.<br /><br />The company I purchased it from gave me a quick refund and didn't even want these defective units returned. I would make a purchase from them anytime—just not for one of these adapters."
801,5,"My only regret about getting this cable was that I didn't get a longer one, improve visual quality from my previous cable I would highly recommend."
802,5,Super!  Solved the problem we were having with old HDMI.
803,5,Simple and effective for those who live in the country without acces public warning systems.  Easy to program.
804,4,Just bought this on clearing section and it sounds great only $20! I will go by tomorrow to buy some more for gifts.
805,5,"Exactly, what I need for my 730."
806,4,Good and easy to use
807,2,"This might work for someone, but for me it was basically useless.  Had hoped to use it with Kindle.  Not supported."
808,5,"This is perhaps the greatest 14 gauge speaker wire deal that is available on Amazon. Easy to unroll, easy to pull through walls, and truly great sound. I chose this cable after a month of research for my latest install. My customer wanted grand sound on an extremely limited budget. I was able to achieve this with great budget components, connectors and now cable.<br /><br />I highly recommend this cable for projects ranging from pauper to princely! ALWAYS REMEMBER: you only want to install in-wall cables ONCE! Do it right the first time! You can swap out in-ceiling and in-wall speakers as your needs and budget dictate. When it comes to chose in-wall cable, don't just settle. Look for high strand counts, oxygen-free copper and tough flexible jackets as base requirements during decision time."
809,5,Really a good buy at a small price.  You can't go wrong with this radio!
810,4,"These cushions took a little bit of effort to get onto my headphones, but they are just as comfortable if not more comfortable than the original cushions."
811,4,"This is a great subwoofer. I have a home theater system with 5.1 surround sound and a projector. When I got the whole set up I fired it up and it was awesome. I watched a few movies over the course of a couple weeks but something was missing, I had good audio but I didn't have a sub yet. I got on amazon and was looking for a good sub but being a college student I had a low budget. This sub is reasonably priced and works great! As soon as I hooked it up I played some call of duty and the bass adds so much to the sound. It works so well in fact that I had to turn its volume way down because  it over powered the rest of my speakers, but once I got it adjusted it just sounded great. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not five is because the auto off feature doesn't seem to work right. It doesn't turn off when I shut off the rest of the system. Everything else works great though so I don't mind turning it on and off for every use, it's not a big deal. I'm sure there are better subs out there but for the price, this sub can't be beat. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a sub on a budget."
812,5,"A great back-up/travel cord for my AppleTV. No problems with it, whatsoever, despite it being a tad thinner than the OEM cable."
813,1,Never worked couldn't even get the thing to power up. Guess there was a reason that model was discontinued.
814,5,Only problem is the blue light is bright irritating and unnecessary.
815,4,One of the best MP3 players on the market even though it has been replaced with newer models that appear cheaper and have less features and is significantly smaller.
816,5,"I have been hunting for a great pair of headphones for a while now.  I've tried different wired and wireless versions and while I found some good ones that had drawbacks I could workaround, they all eventually died or got two annoying to deal with, particularly because the primary use for me was during running and workouts.  These headphones blow every other one I've tried out the water!  #HandsDown<br /><br />For the most part the other reviews on here capture the awesomeness well so I'll keep it fairly brief, but I will highlight the following:<br />* These headphones LOOK awesome, it has a very sleek, low profile style that looks great whether on your head or around your neck<br />* These headphones FEEL awesome too.  It is lightweight and you will easily forget that they are there.  Ear buds, etc. have always given me some problems, leaving me to believe that I have weird ears or something, but these fit nice and snug with any kind of claustrophobic side effects. The cushy covers feel great as well and for as long as I have them on, I never feel like they begin to burn into the side of my head and I never get scratchy with it.<br />* These headpones SOUND awesome!  I paired my phone, fired up my test music (may I suggest &#34;DJ Nicholas' - Cut it off&#34;, &#34;Katy Perry's - Darkhorse&#34;, &#34;Turn down for what&#34;) and immediately, my inflated expectations were totally blown away with gale force proportions!  Oh MY GOODNESS!  The sound quality is awesome, it blocks out environmental noise and the BASS... oh wow the bass... was wayyyy better than what I expected from a Bluetooth headphones.  I had by this point just come to expect that bass by bluetooth was never going to be great.  This shattered that theory!<br />* These headphones WORK awesome!  As I mentioned, my primary use of these are for running and working out cause I got sick of earphones falling out due to impact, motion and sweat.... with this... all that is no longer a factor.  I can finally get my run on with zero distraction due to having to fix my earphones or wires, etc.  The only time I have to make any adjustments are sometimes during lie flat bench presses... and it's mainly because I have a shined head... I'm positive that if you have even a little hair, that will be a non-issue for you.  When I first tried these on I walked to the extreme end of a moderately sized grocery store and there was zero degradation (which was a minimum 20 feet).  I have yet to discover what the cut out distance, but maybe I'll update with that in the future.  These things pair easily and quickly and perform great.  You may see conflicting reviews about this but what I've found is that you have to take into account the device you're pairing with.  If your device has weak bluetooth, is kinda crappy or is running low on power, I've found that all that can affect things.<br /><br />It charges really quickly and yes, the battery lasts really really long, I've gone through multiple workout sessions without needing to re-charge.<br />The buttons are easy to find and manipulate and works great for me as well.<br /><br />I have yet to do any call testing, but I'll probably update with that once I've put it through its paces.<br /><br />All in all, this is an unbelievable AWESOME product and I highly recommend it.et my run on with zero distraction due to having to fix my earphones or wires, etc.  The only time I have to make any adjustments are sometimes during lie flat bench presses... and it's mainly because I have a shined head...

817,1,"Sigh. Got one of the lemons I guess. Bought to replace a switcher that died after three years. Feeding a Roku2, Directv receiver and a BlueRay player. Get black on the Directv and a kind of hash with the Roku. It's heading back whence it came. Amazon returns policy appreciated in cases like this."
818,4,Great for  office<br />Quick response<br />Clear sound
819,5,"This single earbud is wonderful.  I spend a lot of time either on public transportation or walking around a busy city, and just don't feel safe or aware if I'm wearing two noise-cancelling earbuds.  I've tried three other single-bud products, and this one is by far the best.  Very long cord, the sound is wonderful (and more than clear/loud enough to be easily heard over the noises of the city), and the fit is actually really comfortable, even over long periods of use.  Most importantly for me, this has an independent volume-adjustment switch -- I haven't found this on other single-bud models, so for me, this feature puts it over the top.  I highly recommend."
820,4,"I have been using these for almost a week now and I am pleased. They are not so comfortable that you forget they are in, but they do improve the comfort of the hard plastic of a lot of earbuds. The price is a bit high, considering that you get 3 pairs but you will only be able to use one (2 at max). The sound quality is decent, no complaints on that end. This is a solid product."
821,2,"If you're looking to put your old vinyl collection on itunes looks elsewhere. This will only load to your computer's media player. If I had known that I wouldn't have ordered it. But I did attempt to record 2 albums. The first one went okay but when I went to record the second one the first one played as well and recorded right over the second! As usual, crappy instructions. Stay away."
822,4,"These aren't only my first pair of true, open back headphones, but also my first pair of Grados. For a very long time I've only used closed back headphones and earbuds, my most recent acquisition of a pair of the Philips Fidelio L1 was the closest I'd come thus far to open back headphones and to be honest, I wasn't very impressed with them.<br /><br />The Grado SR60s have, for long, been recommended as one of the best sounding, sub $100 headphones and as I was in the market for a new pair, I figured now would be a good time to try out a pair since a new version had been released as well. Reading reviews about these headphones online didn't help me form any opinions as people seemed to have a love-hate relationship with them. But, given the price, I figured it would be best for me to form my own opinion and so I ordered them.<br /><br />The headphones arrived in a very simple cardboard box with a printed note inside it that talked about break in, volume levels etc. the headphones themselves look vintage and are built mostly of plastic which don't really feel very assuring in your hands. They're also very light, which kind of belies their vintage appearance. One of the main improvements for these headphones have been mentioned as improved sensitivity, which means they'll do better on mobile devices. So right off the bat I plugged these into my iPhone and started playing music through the beats app which is set for high quality streaming. To be honest, I wasn't blown away, but I was also not very disappointed. Compared to the Fidelio which is a very dark sounding and bass heavy headphone, the Grado felt leaner and definitely had more detail in the higher registers. The biggest change that I heard though was in the soundstage, it did feel more open and ambient, which at first feels unreal but slowly becomes more natural, akin to listening in a room. I then plugged these into my restored, vintage Marantz 2285B receiver which has a stunning headphone amp. Right off the bat, the sound quality improvement was significant; the midrange and bass opened up and came more forward and the headphones didn't sound lean anymore. Compared to the Fidelio, the bass is light, but more resolved and clean and the high frequencies are definitely more detailed and airy. Without a doubt, these headphones place some amount of emphasis on the upper mids and lower treble which gives the sound this detailed and open quality. I can see why some people find this sound \\""bright\\"" as the sound can feel that way with some sources, especially low quality mp3s etc. but the headphones do get slightly better and slightly warmer with break-in.<br /><br />At this point, I definitely enjoy these headphones very much and cannot fault them too much especially considering the price. Although these headphones sound good with mobile devices, they'll definitely benefit from a good DAC or headphone amp. They sound their worst on an iPhone, better on an iPad and their best when run through an amp, but this doesn't mean they're horrible on an iPhone, they sound fine but I just don't see how anyone would want to use them with a mobile phone since they don't have a mic, have a long & thick cable and most importantly ar open back, which means they'll let ambient sound in.<br /><br />Coming from closed headphones, I'm very impressed with this pair of Grados and can recommend them very easily without reservation. They're an excellent buy for the price and with use will have a more settled and even keeled sound which is easy to listen to.lity improvement was significant; the midrange and bass opened up and came more forward and the headphones didn't sound lean anymore.

823,3,This was worth it
824,3,See stars for recommendation.
825,5,Wonderful little speaker! Great sound from such a small device. The quality was more than I expected for the price.
826,5,"I control two Vornados in two different rooms and 1 entertainment center with these. Vornados are difficult to turn off as they are at the ground level and you have to manually turn the knob to off position.<br /><br />I purchased this item for comfort and convenience, but was pleasantly surprised later that I am saving a ton of electricity.<br />I am using 1 of these bad boys for my entertainment center, which consists of an Philips LCD TV, Philips 5.1 Home theater system (with DVD player) and Verizon Wireless router with inbuilt modem.<br /><br />I recently checked the standby wattage of all of these (wireless router running) and was surprised to see that they were consuming 90 Watts. So, now, when I go to bed at night, I just press a button and the whole entertainment center and wireless router shut down.<br /><br />An added advantage is that my family now sleeps in less wireless signal (not sure if it affects health in anyway though).<br /><br />Each outlet consumes 1.7 Watts instead of 0.6 watts as advertised.<br /><br />Hope this review helps."
827,5,Excellent price and it was exactly how I hoped it would be. The cord is long so I could run it from the wall to my desk. It's also nice that the surge protector is flat/skinny.
828,4,"Cheap and cheerful. For the price, they do the job as knockabout headphones that I don't have to worry about damaging."
829,5,"I love these, only con is they slip off my ears sometime, but idk maybe I just have a small head lol."
830,5,Great wireless headphones!  I was surprised how far away I could walk with them on and still hear the TV.
831,5,Works Well
832,2,"Audio quality isn't as good as expected. Lots of clipping.. base/low frequencies have no depth. It's just a regular bluetooth headset. Not spectacular or great, as you'd expect in this price range from this manufacturer."
833,5,Perfect
834,5,I have 5 of these. I use every single one. They bring me great joy.
835,5,Excelente
836,5,Works as intended.
837,2,Does not transmit clean signal to receiver.
838,5,Nice frequency response good volume.
839,5,works great
840,5,great product and price. fast delivery
841,4,Works fine
842,5,The only corded earphones I've ever liked and wanted to keep. I think I'll buy more actually.
843,5,keep the good work up may God bless you all.
844,5,"My son was given a 40 inch tv by a friend and all it needed was a new lamp. This lamp was perfect for the tv. Simple to install and now my son has a tv that was originally probably a $2,000 tv for under $30."
845,5,Life savers on a long flight. A must for all travellefs like myself.
846,5,Have not yet gotten an alert on this one but I think it will be great for when I travel.
847,5,"These things are almost perfect.  A little heavy, thought they'd be too clunky..  but I quickly forget while I'm at the gym.  Very easy to connect to my phone.  They stack up nicely to the Dr dre beats my buddy has.  They actually seem louder, sound quality is close enough for me...  and I record and mix rock music so I have a good ear for frequency."
848,1,Ur actually advertising that the batteries r included in the picture
849,1,"This was a gift to my husband for his birthday.  He absolutely LOVES them.  They were easy to sync to his iphone and they are great for his workouts.  Maybe he'll get ME a pair for MY birthday!  The above review was when I 1st ordered the product...we're 9 months into my husband actively using the product and they don't work - they no longer charge.  I contacted BlueAnt to make a claim on the 1 year warranty and I feel like I'm getting the run around.  My claim was approved 3 weeks ago and I have yet to receive confirmation on the replacement order being filled and shipped.  Hopefully we will get the product replaced soon, but there is definitely no sense of urgency being exercised on the part of their customer service!  This company is TERRIBLE!!! It is now nearly 4 months after I filed a claim for replacement because the headphones no longer charge.  I got an email a week ago to verify my address YET AGAIN and we still don't have a replacement or any confirmation of a replacement being processed!!! So, if they break, don't expect them to honor the warranty!!"
850,3,"This thing didn't helped me to improve the reception. I'm renting a home that has one of those old exterior antennas it is set in a direction where I can pick up clear signals from a number of local channels. However channel 7 which is ABC don't come out good. I thought this digital thing would help. But it is worse than the exterior antenna. When I set the Tv to look for channels, it gives me about 60 mostly trash (all television programs are trash that I don't care for paying to connect anyway) but don't even pick up channel 7. My digital TV, using the old exterior antenna do a better work"
851,5,"These headphones are AMAZING! The sound quality is out of this world and they are so light weight, they are very comfortable to wear. I am very happy with this purchase and I recommend them."
852,5,it came today and I will be using it tonight . We had planed on getting a new one for my night standing and I like it very much thank you
853,5,works great and doesnt cost an arm and a leg. I have no idea why companies charge more than $5 for these. These work just as good as those 2.5 million dollar monster aux cords. plus they are a bright color so they are easy to find in the car
854,5,"So far so good. In the reviews some people said the cones don't fit over the ear. They do fit over my ears and I'm a 33 y/o male. I do have kind of small ears so if you're ears are a bit bigger than average, these cones may not fit entirely over your ears. Sound is good, but the cord isn't the cloth nice cord, it's a rubber kinda cheap cord. These do come with a nice little bag though and an adapter for a larger headphone input. I have no real complaints so far. I'll update the review if something goes wrong."
855,5,ALL GOOD
856,2,"The JBL Loft 30's are pretty uninspiring speakers. Just plain boring little black boxes that make sound. Simple and plain isn't always bad, but with disappointing sound quality there isn't any reason to pick these over other similarly priced bookshelf speakers.<br /><br />Having done a detailed review, disassembly and frequency response test to these speakers, it is very evident that these speakers a lacking. The highs are on the harsher side of things, but what is really distracting is a large and very audible hump in the l bass and midbass areas. It causes the speakers to be very muddy sounding and causes some nasty things to happen to deeper vocals.<br /><br />These speakers are definite passes as much better speakers can be had in same price point.<br /><br />Google &#34;jbl loft vs infinity primus&#34; and you can find my review."
857,5,"Good price,  fast delivery"
858,5,Real 2 day shipping!! Works perfect with jumper cable! Very happy
859,5,Good antenna for the price
860,5,Fast delivery. Great sound.
861,5,good deal
862,5,I use this as a pre-amp to connect my iPhone to my stereo.  Sound quality going through the tubes helps to correct the not so great quality of digital music.  Works great and the price is right.  This was originally listed as a headphone amplifier which it is not.  This is a some assembly required product and do not recommend if you are not comfortable around LIVE electricity.  It can hurt you!
863,5,Works like a charm.
864,5,Ok
865,5,Very satisfied extra speedy service<br />I had remote in my hand In three days<br />Original equipment very reasonable a +++
866,5,Thanks.
867,5,"Impressed! Substantial in every way. Absolutely makes a difference in sound quality. Nice thick heavy duty construction. Have it hooked up to a relatively high end system so minor details amplified. However, I believe it would enhance a more budget oriented system and help it sound high end. Buy it!"
868,5,excellent choice
869,5,"I've actually forgotten why I bought this, but it is well made and sturdy!"
870,5,Simple cheap and works great. No complaints
871,4,"I'm sure they're wonderful sounding. If you're deaf.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. They're headphones<br />2. Did not cost too much<br />3. The sound reproduction is excellent, even at lower volumes they retain the warm and body of the music.<br />4. The little vinyl pouch is more useful than I thought it would be, I use it to keep the headphones intact in my pocket.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. way way too loud. on setting 1 volume, they deafened me to the point of pain in quiet situations.<br />2. The stereo mini jack into the device I'm using from the headphones has this weird arch, I would prefer a low profile, as the higher type gets caught on things.<br />3. Asymmetric headphone wire - this is an exercising improvement - but really - if you're using these for exercising, let me introduce you to any set of headphones that hook over the ears or Bluetooth.<br /><br />In summary, these headphones are great for everyday commute use, but not for a quiet office."
872,5,"This 35' HDMI Cable was connected between a Computer and an HDTV in another room.<br />A better quality shielded HDMI cable was needed to provide multi channel audio and 1080P video from a Media Center computer in another room to a 65&#34; 3D HDTV.<br />The run was more challenging as the cable needed to conform to several 45 degree angles, parallel with metal, and had to be pulled through flooring to reach the TV.<br /><br />There was a possibility the installation might cause the wire inside the cable to develop an open connection or a deterioration of signal.<br /><br />The long length cable and difficult installation had no effect.<br /> Audio and Video is excellent.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this high quality product and will order additional cables again whenever needed."
873,5,"works properly.  much easier to attach that crimp-on connectors (in my opinion).  once twisted on, they hold securely.  used with a coax r6 cable to connect my subwoofer to my receiver."
874,5,100% satisfied.
875,5,"These are wonderful, I have 7 battery back-ups and mostly because those power cells on the cord takes all the room on the back-up.  I was able to use these and now have room for more items if needed and I just pushed the power back to behind the battery back-up.  They should have come up with something like this a long time ago.  Highly recommend if you are a tech person with lots of electronics"
876,5,"3 years and 3000 hours later, this bulb is still functioning great."
877,5,"Excellent quality and design<br />It's cheap and good quality earbud, I will definately recommmand this to anyone"
878,3,Not as loud as I was hoping for.
879,5,"right part, right price"
880,5,Fits records perfectly. They rip rather easy if you get tape stuck to them but they are very cheap for what you get.
881,5,"These are great. I wanted to mention that I accidentally washed these in one of my pants, and then dried them for an hour in the dryer and they still work fine. Would buy again."
882,4,"Works great, especially for the money.  Bluetooth synchs easily.  Sound is very good given the size."
883,5,everyhing worked fine
884,3,"-1 Star<br />My &#34;new&#34; mp3 player came preloaded with someone else's screamo/emo rock music on it. Buying the newest model/new option at full price i was expecting it to be unused.<br /><br />-1 Star<br />Lowend is very weak. Mid-low range frequencies dont come through too hot. For an in ear player its acceptable. Although they could have afforded just a little more of a bass boost.<br />.....<br /><br />Overall this is a great music player for active use. If you are browsing to find something for just leisurely listening, look elsewhere, especially at this price range. No audiophile quality to be found here. As far as active use, i use mine regularly for dancing (popping/bboying), yoga/bodyweight/lifting and other light yardwork ect. These are very comfy once you get the correct ear sizing in place. They also handle spry movement and sweating well, without falling out or being irritating to manage. No cords is a huge plus.<br /><br />Cliffs<br /><br />PROS<br />Stay in place and are comfy<br />No Cords<br />Excellent battery life<br />High end and upper mids are crisp and clean sounding<br /><br />CONS<br />Almost non-existent low end/bass<br />Shuffle mode/folder mode likes to play favorites with your music. You will hear some songs more than others, similar to WMplayer. (not quite as bad when using play all's shuffle function and not a problem with just on play all being used)"
885,5,"good deal, good  price"
886,1,"useless, broke within a week"
887,5,"This record player is great, I was a little concerned with the quality of materials, and had a weird clicking sound when I first played my vinyls through it. But for whatever reason that went away after about an hour of run time, I don't expect it to last the test of time, but its great for now, you need to turn it up pretty much full blast to get any full sound out of it. I think if I paired this with some decent speakers it would be great!"
888,5,Good
889,4,Amazing sound quality but the bluetooth range is far from whats advertised. Starts cutting out when youre 10ft away. Sounds very full and clear with just enough bass. Amazing speaker.
890,5,Worked fine for me and love all the extras
891,5,"Initially I was sceptical of the noice-cancelling. However I took them to work and when no one was around I turned it on without even having music on the room suddenly lost all noise. The fans were running, the computers were humming, and yet inside my eardrums they didn't make a sound. Pretty awesome! I did have to use my own batteries since the ones they gave me were dead on arrival (but I didn't really pay for batteries I wanted the headphones). Sound quality is really good. When you turn on the noise cancelling it is actually louder and is amplified."
892,5,Picks up a lot of channels if near a big city
893,4,"All works well, the velcro wraps are a waste because you have to bend back one end for the wrap to stick. Cable and adapters are  fine."
894,5,This is one of the best radio/clocks I have ever owned. Everyone loves the look of this product.
895,5,"I tried another well-reviewed product, and this one seems a much better combination of low price, small size, quality build, great and balance sound, enough bass to hear a jazz bass solo, and classical organic music. It's really am amazing combo for an audiophile on the go! I think one would have to go much larger -- too large for convenient travel - to get more bass. Put it in a corner and the overall balance is very listenable, even to an audiophile who needs clean, full sound and is a critical listener for years. Great choice!"
896,4,They work great love them
897,5,"Sounds great, perfect for beach or on the go"
898,5,"Verbatim make the best cd-r's and especially dual sided dvd's.<br />If you want something you can rely on get Verbatims. I've yet to have a &#34;coaster&#34; with these, which is why I buy them."
899,5,I was very pleased with the sound quality and the time that it took to get from Japan here.  You did a great job and thanks.
900,3,"Cuts out every once and a while from 10-15 feet away.  Maximum range on this is DEFINITELY 33 feet, it's unusable at 30."
901,2,"....sounded good while they lasted, I brought 2 of this model, one for my son...that pair one side stopped working, my paint noise reduction stopped working, his pair lasted a year, mine 18 months. The price now is a lot lower than what I paid. I feel like my money was wasted. I will say when listening on a plane the quality with the noise reduction was very good, the sound quality was very good. Long term use for the price was terrible."
902,5,"Love this thing!! The only issue is the cord that plugs into your iPod is a pain in the ass to get it back in it's spot to close the door for water tight seal. Other than that, it's amazing!"
903,4,Great head phones but converter causes a bit of sound loss
904,5,it works!
905,4,Picks up a lot of channels for sure. I live in southern California about 45 miles south east of LA and I get tons of channels.
906,5,"Had to add a signal amplifier because of my distance from the towers, but this is the only antenna that I could find that will pick up all the stations. I would buy it again in a heartbeat.  Easily mounted it in my attick."
907,5,using them to run pc to a 70 vizio and 55 sony lcd have had zero issues wow great quality I will be buying more to rerun every cable in my house if you think they are cheap made they are not but to be honest I thought they would be glad I was wrong
908,4,works as needed
909,5,"I have searched many online stores for the right power supply for my Shuttle SN78SH7.  I ordered items that appeared to be the right match, but I ended up returning them because they don't fit in the slot and some are completely different PS all together.  I was very happy to receive this PS that is exactly the right PS for my computer.  It is an updated version of my old one but nevertheless, it is the right PS - connectors, mounting slots, etc.  Thank you for meeting my needs."
910,5,"I have Sony products for years, you really can't beat Sony for quality.  Also, they arrived promptly and as the ad stated they would."
911,5,Remote arrived on time and works perfectly.
912,5,Really cleaned up the rear of my TV...I no longer can see any wires.
913,2,"The antenna would only pick up the local Fox and CW channels. Most of the broadcast towers are southwest of my home. Unfortunately, I could only face the antenna north or west. As a bird flies, the towers are about 30 miles from my location. Apparently, too much interference lies in the path of the signal. Regardless, I still cut the cord. Amazon Prime is my friend, along with Netflix."
914,5,"Excellent MP3 player. I bought one for myself and for a friend who loves it. The mobility is excellent, the radio works very well."
915,5,i am very happy.  Fast delivery and excellent quality.
916,4,"Great product with crystal clear high quality sound and zero static.  The wireless signal allowed me to walk an estimated 60' with several walls along the path.  My hearing isn't as good as my wife's so I primarily bought to use with the TV so I can turn the volume up without being too distracting to her.  However, my TV didn't have the headphone connection and only had the digital 'Toslink optical' out.  Since the transmitter didn't have an optical or hdmi connection I had to purchase a digital to analog audio converter which didn't work at all.  I purchased the DBTech from DBROTH here on Amazon and I was only able to get audio to work on the right ear of the headset.  When I bypassed that device and just plugged up to my Samsung tablet the sound was absolutely great.  I'll have to return the DBTech converter and try something else to get it to work with the TV.  If the Sennheiser transmitter would have given more connection options I would have easily given this product a 5 star rating.  Once you are able to get the 'audio' sourcing and cabling issues resolved this is a 5 star item that costs MUCH less than other highly advertised sets such as the Beats Audio.  These are very lightweight and comfortable."
917,5,I dont have the watches yet but the others are wonderfull
918,5,"The bulb came on time, installed easily and works great."
919,5,Great headphones!!
920,3,"It's a nice little device, but it stuck to the wall then fell 10 minutes later and then the sound got a bit muffly and it still is a bit! Plus, when you turn the volume all the way up, it makes it basically where you can't understand anything because it's so muffly. :( At a lower volume, it's OK, but I'm one of those people that likes it loud, and it doesn't seem to do that well enough for me."
921,5,works exactly like advertised. great addition to the bathroom!
922,5,"Ordered this for my surround sound in my barn. It works great upstairs and downstairs and the sound is amazing ( used RCA jack on my receiver). This will go through wood but not metal, the siding on my barn is metal. Played spiteful from my iPhone for 6hrs+ no issues at all."
923,1,erroneous.
924,5,Ibought this product along with the Digitrex Digtal Analog converter box
925,5,"Great items, had a minor problem and I contacted the seller they got back to me in a timely manner.  I would suggest this item works great with Samsung note 3, and Samsung S5"
926,5,sturdy and good looking
927,1,Battery life is horrible.  Only about 20 minutes - not exaggerating.  Returning immediately.
928,5,Super deal and works well
929,4,Needs cross fade feature. Other than that its great.
930,4,"Let me preface this by saying I am in no way involved with the hi-fi audiophile subculture, and am reviewing this from the viewpoint of your run of the mill 'I only listen to music from my phone' consumer.<br /><br />These headphones are, quite obviously, a very nice looking piece of equipment. Real walnut panels, steel construction, plush pleather cups and headband cover. Light, for all that steel and wood. On my pair, I noticed a fair amount of seeping out where the padded pleather meets the steel headband, an aesthetic niggle, it seems quite securely attached.<br /><br />My other concern is the wire between the cans and headband. The cans can swivel towards each other, and the only thing stopping the can from going all the way round is that wire. Seems like a definite stress point.<br /><br />All said, the sound quality is wonderful. Not the ear rattling bass emphasis of Beats, SOL Republics, or even a pair of Skull Candy Hesh's I got from Target for $40, but they are aiming for clarity, not overwhelming bass. Not that the bass is weak, it still resolves in a sonically pleasing way, but if you are looking for some shaking in your ears, you won't be thrilled. They have something of a mid range hump keeping from being truly flat, but like my preface states, I'm not looking for true studio quality.<br /><br />As John Q. Consumer, not an audiophile, not someone looking to wear headphones for the supposed prestige of the brand, not someone who listens to EDM and hip hop exclusively, I can recommend these. They are comfy, sound good, and have what I can only call a 'handsome, manly' aesthetic."
931,5,they met my expectations
932,1,6 months later and it wont charge.
933,1,"have had several of these which functioned ok for light duty - most recent purchase ate two sets of batteries in one week, obviously something wrong / shorting out - sent back - maybe try one more and see if get lucky?"
934,5,Pretty good bluetooth  device. ..Just as good as any of the other major brands. ...
935,5,Super cheap worth the money
936,1,Worked for 7 minutes then broke...
937,5,Perfect exactly what I needed for the one television. Didn't realize that I needed a Male Connector for the other television. I will have to return one cable.
938,2,"I was so excited to get this because I don't have cable. I tried it in 10 different areas but unfortunately, all I could get were shopping, Hispanic, and religious channels; not one regular network channel."
939,5,As expected! Great value!!!
940,5,"By far the best sounding Wireless headphone.  It is also nice that I have multiple sources plugged into it and can change from the headset. Distance isn't quite what it says, but I could go 60+ feet from the receiver in my house. If i needed more I would listen somewhere else."
941,5,"Bought this because of reviews and Tripp Lite name and reputation. I don't know anything about the engineering behind it but it works, no problems, no buzzing, nothing weird. Would buy again if I had to. Owned six months."
942,5,Seems well made.
943,2,"Worked only once, then the smaller connector came loose.  We're returning it because it is worthless."
944,4,Everything was as advertised and worked well.
945,4,The only thing it is missing is a USB port for charging my phone. I can definitely read it at night even without the red display on the ceiling. The low setting for the display might be too bright for someone wanting a very dark room. It does have a setting for the display to turn off automatically. Add a USB and this would be 5 star.
946,5,"My previous receiver was an Onkyo NR-709, which while being 2-3 years old, is roughly equivalent to this receiver, and in some cases  is better than this receiver, while at a lower cost point.<br /><br />So lets go over the basics.<br /><br />- 7.2 Channel, lets you bi-amp front speakers if you want<br />- Multiple zone, including multiple hdmi output for zones (this is unique, but maybe not worth it)<br />- Connections (MHL, Airplay, Wifi, DLNA, Bluetooth)<br />- Fast on screen display.  Quickly shows up, easily selectable, fast switching.<br />- Almost everything else you'd expect in a modern receiver (6 hdmi inputs, 2 outputs, various optical/component/composite inputs for video and audio).<br /><br />So far this has kind of seemed like an upgrade in some respects, especially with connectivity, built in wifi/bluetooth/airplay, etc make this really nice to integrate into my network.  But other things it feels like a side grade or event a downgrade.  For instance you can name and setup most of your inputs, but when you select the input it doesn't usually show up on the text on the receiver itself.  I used to fumble hitting the different buttons on the remote until I found the right one, but now you click on watch, which brings up the on screen display and you select from there.  It works and I've gotten used to it, just feel like I miss the label of what is current selected (maybe there is a way to do this and I just haven't figured it out).<br /><br />Sounds quality is quite good, although the speaker setup uses Sony's own audio setup with their own mic.  The good news is that it is incredible fast.  Bad news is that it might not be as good as Audyssey, but I can't tell, so we'll go with good enough.  Choosen different 'reference' rooms and such seems a bit of a gimmick, but overall the sound feels quite good and for some reason seems a bit warmer to me than my previous receiver.<br /><br />It feels like it's roughly inline with offerings from other companies, butpotentially not standing out.  The zone 2 HDMI seems to set it apart, but otherwise this is a good looking good offering in this price range."
947,4,"Exceeded all of my expectations, especially for the the price that I paid. I would recommend these to anyone. A+"
948,1,"I am really enjoying it,However I cannot appreciate having to send the defectived tape player back. That is costing me money and I don't think that is fair at all"
949,1,Did not give me 1 channel!<br />Probably ok for non mountain areas<br />I get 2 channels with an old antenna on the roof!
950,5,"I like it very much, there is only one thing which is that will be better if has a battery to be played without conection.<br />Beside no complains at all. Good job."
951,5,"Lucky to find a 13v replacement battery to fit my old (but like new) Craftsman drill.  Product arrived as scheduled, well packaged, and was what I expected.  A few hours on the charger and I was ready to go ...  :)"
952,5,"This is fantastic for travel, as it has USB ports so you can easily charge your phone/Ipod. No complaints at all! Been using it for the past four months living abroad with absolutely no problems."
953,3,"It's okay for what it is, a budget low power amp. I am using to drive two Yamaha outdoor speakers. Sound is mediocre and vloume has to be cranked up for only moderate sound levels."
954,5,"This product does work for me big time. It is just what I was looking for, at a great price. Not much more to say, other the I have a McIntosh Amp and Sennheiser head phones. GREG"
955,5,This speaker has great sound and still fits perfectly in my medium size purse. I plan on purchasing another one soon.
956,5,I forgot how vivid the colors were until I had to replace the bulb.  This one works great and much cheaper than the Phillips
957,3,"The Sennheiser IS410 Wireless Ultra-lightweight Assistive  Listening Stereo works just fine, however, they did not<br /><br />send me any earphone cushions to go with it.  So I rate them only a 3 star since they did not send me everything the<br /><br />unit claims it would.  Without the earphone cushions it is painful to use the unit.<br /><br />Raphael  Chrastil<br />P.O. Box 88<br />Dorchester, NE.  68343<br /><br />order # 104-1863509-1425828"
958,1,Knock off - Replica beats by dr. dre.<br /><br />Buyer be aware !
959,4,"I read on another review about them being a little heavy, they are more than most. After I changed the ear bud piece(double budding buds) they fit in my ears better and you can hear the highs as well as the good bass. The volume(up & down) control works okay on my BlackBerry 9900, but not switching tracks did not. To answer a phone call while they are still plugged in worked okay too. This model was only made for Apple & Android phones. Koss does make good quality sound headphones, that's why I wanted to try out this model Ear Bud plus Microphone to use with my cell phone, I have NOT had anyone say to me while on the phone...&#34;What did you say&#34; only &#34;where are you I can hear some birds&#34;...lol I was outside at the time...:)"
960,4,The headphones work well.  I did have a little trouble adjusting them to my small head. The sound through the headset  is excellent.
961,5,"This is the first turntable I've owned since I was a kid (it's been a few decades), but turning this on and delicately dropping the needle to the vinyl again was so much better than jumping back on a bicycle could ever be.  This component is super-solid; it is everything that is advertised and more, from the sturdy construction to the pop-up light to help you perfectly set the stylus at the exact spot you want, it was a fantastic father's day gift for me.<br /><br />Remember back when you would walk across the floor and the record would skip?  The legs on this thing act as baffles to absorb basic shock so you don't have worry about it.  And now I can pull out the old LPs and 45s and convert them easily to MP3 so I can enjoy them in the car.<br /><br />All the great features I loved before in a turntable are here in this one -- perfectly set the arm pressure with a slight twist of the counterweight balance; perfectly adjust the speed with the strobe light -- but get this, wanna know what John really said at the end of Strawberry Fields?  Just flip the switch to reverse and play it backward.<br /><br />Anything bad?  No.  The only thing I can think of is that it would be nice for the arm to auto-retract at the end of the album, but no biggie. This is high-class retro at its best!"
962,5,This is a great little speaker. I love the clarity! I also love the amount of volume you get from this.
963,5,Now I can watch my movies in the comfort of my favorite spot on the couch LOL. I would definitely recommend this to other people! No quality lost whatsoever. High quality product.
964,1,Didn't work and parts were missing.  Tried for several days to figure out how to work it to no avail.  No instructions came with it.
965,4,"These rechargeable li-ion batteries are great for medium to high use scenarios (I use them for powering a wireless mic).<br />The charged voltage is 8.4V, which is good (better than 6 cell NiMH batteries which only give 7.2V).<br />These batteries, however, are bigger than typical alkaline 9V batteries.<br />Mine measure 0.692&#34; x 1.030&#34; x 1.800&#34; (excluding terminals).<br />This very slightly exceeds in thickness (0.689&#34; max thickness), but should just fit in most devices.<br />It will usually be tricky to get out though.<br />Capacity is far better than NiMH alternatives (600mAh vs 300mAh), and even exceeds standard alkaline cells.<br />So they're good, as long as they fit!"
966,1,Blew after a year . Not happy with  it . It sucked in my tj. Wrangler . A slight step above stock but not impressive.
967,3,"Decent mount but on my Polk Speaker that weighs exactly 10lbs, it can't hold it. Everything slipped out of place and then stripped when trying to tighten more. Would be good for a 8lb speaker or less."
968,2,"listed as 66lbs. capacity but box says 45lbs. and hardware kit was not complete for proper mounting. I wanted to use this for an older(and heavier) flat panel. This mount was inexpensive and appears to be a decent value, however,  I'm not confident enough to use it for my application. I guess I would use it for a lightweight unit."
969,5,"I had an Edge on my Integra (Onkyo) receiver, then changed to an AF-1 but still had a hard time picking up KALW, the oldest non-commercial station west of the Mississippi: lots of hiss from their weak signal, so I took the dive into the FMPro.<br /><br />Aesthetics prohibited putting it high up on the inside wall, and when it was down low the signal was really bad, so I mounted it outside, horizontal, pretty much facing San Francisco.<br /><br />Clear crisp signal now, ready in time for Sunday morning's Philosophy Talk program.<br /><br />Do note that cable from the antenna to the receiver is not included so there is some additional expense involved."
970,5,"I'm not a Polk fan. In the past every Polk speaker I heard was overly bright and fatiguing to the ears. With these, I'm now leaning toward changing that opinion.<br /><br />These are not bright, nor muddy or boomy. I would say they are just right if understandably lacking in the low end. For surrounds they are perfect as those channels are dominated by the higher frequencies this speaker reproduces so well.<br /><br />Well made, solid boxes, perfect compact size, and they look good with and without the grill."
971,5,Good quality. It works well for drowning out my kids noise and its okay when I mow the lawn while wearing them.
972,3,"I bought two of these, one for wet cleaning with distilled water, one for dry.  The only complaint is that the pad wants to separate at the edges in the wet mode.  Otherwise it seems to do the job on vinyls.  I also use the dry brush to clean my bigscreen TV."
973,5,I ordered this adapter just a couple of days and it arrived in great condition. I was able to connect it to my tv with 3.5 mm adapter  and was able to make it 'wireless' right away. The range and sound quality is pretty good considering it uses bluetooth 2.1
974,3,"As with most of the reviews I would say it's usefulness will be hit or miss.  The primary reason I purchased was that my Fox affiliate had a very, very weak signal and this did help mildly but not to the extent I was hoping (any weather/wind still seems to degrade my signal significantly.  For 11 or so dollars I would say it's worth a shot, just don't expect miracles."
975,4,"The product provides multiple channel, but is not any better than another cheaper model I purchased for another television. The best thing about the product is that is thin and can mount is tighter locations."
976,5,"My son is Spiderman super fan, the headphone is a good quality one, sounds is great. The best gift for my child"
977,1,"I am not using it as much as I expected because my old clock radio is still working, however I think that it will be just what I wanted once I get used to it.  I'm afraid I still have not yet figured out all the intricacies of using the alarm, not that its difficult but because I am an old lady.  Please excuse my rather lame evaluation.  Just say I like it!"
978,5,"This is simply a very short 14/3 extension cord.  I bought 6 of them to hook up to six 12V lights that have the transformer on the plug, right where it goes into the wall, or power strip.  (This was for an exhibit at a trade show)<br /><br />The transformer is very wide so you can only put two of them on a six outlet power/surge strip.  I didn't need or want to pay for a longer 9' or 12'. extension cords. I simply put the six 3' Tripplite cords into the strip then put the 12V transformer into the cord on the other end.  Without them I would have had a large, expensive, and unwieldy &#34;daisy chain&#34; of at least 3 power strips to accomplish the same thing.<br /><br />These would also work well with some of the &#34;offset&#34; plugs that come with computer equipment that cover multiple outlets on your power strip.<br /><br />Highly recommended for this type or application!"
979,5,I wasnt looking for anything special but the nyne bass caught my eye only because it looked cool and easy and convient for traveling. Sound quality is amazing i would recommend this.
980,5,"Walk into  any big box retailer or electronics store and ask if they have any dual driver earbuds. They won't have any idea of what you are talking about. I guarantee it. Nine times out of ten, they will simply walk you over to the Beats by Dre section and tell you to buy Beats, based solely on the fact that they have a nice display--so they must be the best. And they are the most expensive, so they must be the best. And they have a cute, fashionable, lowercase 'b' on the side. So they must be the best.<br /><br />This is a terrible way to make a purchase. Don't do it that way.<br /><br />Online customer reviews are driving product knowledge--and that is how I learned about dual-driver earbuds. The technology is simple to understand. When you look at these earbuds, you can literally see the split delivery system coming from each driver.<br /><br />You don't have to be an expert to appreciate good sound when you hear it. Listen to your $10 earbuds. Then listen to your Brainwavz R1 earbuds.  You will immediately know that you made the right decision. It's that simple.  Yes, there are single-driver earbuds that will produce comparable sound, no doubt about it. But listen to some old favorites on your playlist and sometimes you will hear things on the track that you never heard before.  It could be just a few seconds here and there. But I believe the dual drivers make a difference.<br /><br />Good quality, good performance, good affordability. I like 'em."
981,5,"Devices:<br />-Bose Bluetooth v2.0 (Right Ear)<br />-Jawbone ERA (older model)<br /><br />This is a neat little case! It's crush-proof for when I throw it in my backpack, yet not too thick for when I carry it in my pocket. I got 2 of these (1 for each device) and I found that they are big enough to hold both of my headsets in one case! Great investment if you carry a bag everywhere and use a bluetooth device regularly."
982,5,Fits my K240 AKG headphones perfectly without any wasted space.  The case is well built and should protect headphones well.
983,5,"These earbuds have very good sound quality (to my untrained ear), are more durable than most, and are a great price.  On top of all that they have an ergonomic design that is unlike any others I have purchased.  One earbud is offset to the right and one to the left, which makes for a much more comfortable fit."
984,5,hook up was easy all paper work included came with charger cable. all warranty info was easy to read and understand.
985,5,I was considering Bose for my theater system. I came across this Klipsch system and took a chance on it......turns out it was a great decision. It's a great system and I could not be happier with it. I have been recommending it to all my friends.
986,5,"Easy to follow instructions with sturdy construction. Looks great!!! If you are looking for a great mount for a really good price, then this one is for you."
987,5,Very easy to instal. I have samsung 55'' . It is holding it on strong. My friend put it on for about 15 min. So far so good
988,5,I like the way these are made!!! I have two as I may need a spare for a second tv...Good Product
989,4,"These headphones are great for the money, I really like that they have batteries in the headphones so it doesn't use that much of my phone battery."
990,5,"This product is exactly what we needed when we go to Texas Motor Speedway to watch NASCAR. I rented a scanner at the races one year and that was all it took to make me look into purchasing a pair of my own. Don't get me wrong, the rented product worked and the people were nice but returning the rented scanners was a complete pain. To anyone and everyone looking for a great product, look no further!"
991,5,I use these for talking on my phone all the time as well as listening to music/podcasts.  Seem to fit fine in a smaller ear.
992,5,"I use this as a Monoprice 8323 headphone cable. It sounds good as an upgrade to the stock item. Great workmanship, equal to high-end cables in build quality. It is a bit stiff for my application but this doesn't interfere with functionality. Perfect length for me and should be the right length fo an aux cable application as well. If your not going for an Audioquest, Cardas or similar high-end product I reccommend these STRONGLY over the Monster Cable item. The Monsters will fail. Just got another one in black. (12/22/15). More flexible and it has a rubber rather than cloth jacket. Sounds great, even has nice packaging."
993,4,"This was really easy to use and has great sound. Its not quite as good of sound as my more expensive speaker set I purchased a while back, but it does well."
994,1,These were purchased for Christmas and my son brought them in this morning and only one ear bud is working now.
995,5,"not sure why it says discontinued, it shows it on Razer's web site yet.  it works exactly as intended, keeps your mouse, and in my case, also my keyboard cords from sliding off the desk and/or snagging on stuff.  Might seem a bit pricey, but it clamps the cord firmly, is small and out of the way, yet quite heavy with a rubber grippy base so it does not move.<br />One thing to be aware of, it is intended for mouse cords and will not clamp on very large cords.  For example, my keyboard has mic and headphone jacks and two USB ports so my keyboard cable is pretty thick.  To use it on that I had to zip tie my cord then clamp the zip tie in the Armadillo."
996,5,it works! and it sounds great.  i don't have to put up with that annoying skipping anymore.  no more needed to be said. :)
997,5,It was really easy to mount and it came with all the hardware. It took about 10 minutes to install. Works good with dvd players however my Comcast dvd hangs over the v edge a bit cause it its pretty large.
998,4,So far so good.  Looks like good quality.  Haven't had any problems with this item.  I ordered two of these and have no regrets.
999,4,"Simple and to the point:  It works just as described.  If you need an owners manual to make this work, you should probably go back to analogue TV."
1000,5,I like these because they give me a lot more time with out going dead.  When I use my camera I know they will be useable for quite a while.  I am pleased with this purchase.
1001,5,Quality components at a good price.  Everything I needed to get started with XBMC. I will be getting more soon.
1002,5,"Whenever I need an HDMI cord, chances are I will need another one right away.  I love that this contains two heavy duty HDMI cables that are 6 feet long at an affordable price!  I had no problems using these with our blu-ray player, Xbox and TV.  I like the sturdiness of these cables as I have skimped and bought cheap HDMI cables before and they have felt flimsy and didn't stay in the product I was hooking them into well.  No problems with these and yes I'd recommend them to anyone!"
1003,5,"The Best speakers ever know since Bose. A good quality, design and sound all in Bluetooth tecnology. Don't think twice"
1004,1,"The end that plugs into the headphone does not lock in place.  I ordered this item because my original cable will only play sound out of one side.  With this cable, I either get no sound, sound out of one side or sound out of both sides - it all depends on which way I turn my head and/or how I wiggle and hold the cable.  I ended up plugging in the original bad cable to consistently get sound without having to hold the cable.  I will be ordering the OEM cable from Bose."
1005,5,"The battery box I bought for my camera works really well. The batteries last a while...probably not as long as the rechargeable but this is a great alternative while I search for the cord to my charger! Just pop 4 AA batteries into the box,pop the box into the camera and start shooting! May be a bit cumbersome to some people but AA batteries are available anywhere and you don't have to figure out if they are compatible with your camera."
1006,5,Gets the job done and leaves my devices super clean! I used to have a lot of tiny micro smudges that were difficult to get rid of but this kit took care of it without a problem
1007,4,"Works great as long as I've had it so far... turns out it was too short, but that's my fault!"
1008,5,Easily switches from multiple HDMI sources. Great for de-cluttering all of the HDMI cables that go to your TV. Signal is nice and clear. You can also have all the HDMI signal going and switch back and forth (DVD movie running and switch to another source while it still runs). No need to shut down the source to switch to another.
1009,5,"Good quality. Nice sound. Just a bit of cable noise when it dangling around. Other than that, it's good. Yes."
1010,3,"Set up was a snap. No problem. But this is bluetooth, and I was very disappointed at the effective range. As long are you are in the same room, all good, but not good at all for walking around the house, much less outside. Good unit, but make sure you know exactly what your expectations are."
1011,5,"This post is for those complaining that &#34;the microphone stopped working&#34;. I had same problem and just thought that the raised, etched bump on the mic body was the mic receiver to talk into. Be sure you're not making the same mistake I was, as that actually is the on/off button for the mic. Totally fooled me!"
1012,3,The right earphone is twice as loud as the left... or at least set up differently as to be more accustomed to gaming.<br />- This is what the gamers at school told me and it sort of makes sense<br />I didn't realise this when I ordered them so watch  out for that.
1013,1,Never worked out of the package :-( didn't have time to return it so I am stuck with it. I am pretty sure my boose is the right one as I have bought a different brand of these it worked great for while (1+ year) and broke. This was suppose to be replacements
1014,5,Couldn't be happier with this sound bar.  i use it primarily for music.  Better sound than my stereo system.  Would highly recommend.
1015,5,"I purchased this for my parents.  My Mom is hard of hearing and I bought a wireless headset she can wear to take the audio signal directly to her headset.  She loved that, but since they have three systems, cable TV, antenna and DVD/VCR box, the headset could be only hooked up to one at a time.  They are unable to get behind the TV and swap out audio cables at will, so I looked for some switching mechanism.  I saw some online that looked pretty cheap and had mixed reviews.  I decided to buy this one, invest a little more without going for the more expensive ones.  I also ordered three sets of RCA cables http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I1DN32/ref=cfb_at_prodpg We set this up and it is working beautifully; the audio quality is great.  My folks couldn't be happier  This is a recent setup.  I'll let you know if we run into any problems."
1016,1,"Supposedly warranted but all attempts to exercise the warranty fell flat on their face. Fortunately amazon was, as usual, wonderful and they reimbursed. I am trying another vendor now. This vendor should be forced to remove the 'warranty' information in this product or just forced off the site altogether for fraudulent advertising."
1017,5,I bought these to use in my open office environment and they work great.  I am also going to test them out at the gym.
1018,3,"These were touted as &#34;great for the price&#34; but I can't really agree. The buds aren't comfortable and the sound was only marginally better than the stock Apple headphones. While these aren't terribly by any means, you're better off saving up for the next class of headphones. I've been impressed by both the Harman Kardon AE metal in-ear headphones, as well as the KLIPSH brand. (Though I'd recommend the HK by a long shot! They truly are great.)"
1019,5,My daughter loves these headphones while workin on home work and der-o-o dad doesn't have any of his TV interupted
1020,3,"I purchased these for my 3 year old son so he could watch shows on our tablets while driving in the car.  The nice thing is that the speakers don't go very loud even with the volume set at full.  This is good so my son doesn't blast his ears out.  Now, if I were purchasing these for me I'd be a little upset.  These are a bit quite for what they are.  They are comfortable and light.<br /><br />These were delivered on time via Prime Shipping"
1021,5,"Whether you have a &#34;Lightscribe&#34; DVD burner, or not, the &#34;HP DVD Lightscribe Recordable Media - DVD-R - 16x - 4.70 GB&#34; is an excellent quality DVD Media to for making recordings. And... when purchasing as a 50 Pack Cake, it becomes more affordable. If you already have a &#34;Lightscribe&#34; DVD burner, then purchasing the 50 Pack Cake is a no-brainer decision."
1022,5,Great product..great quality... I love it.... This is my second one bcoz i was really pleased by my 1st purchase.
1023,5,Works great. No problems. Switches over with out any problems. The remote makes it easier to use. Just needs to come with a power cord.
1024,5,"Hi to All<br />This product exceeded my expectation.<br />People, if you want to hear more bass then go for this subwoofer and you'll never regret buying it.<br />Am very happy with it......."
1025,5,"Needed a 75 foot cable to go from a Simaudio Moon 100 D DAC to my Naim integrated amp (DAC is fed by Toslink from Dell Studio desktop computer) for internet radio.  I needed a thin cable thus avoided the more expensive and highly shielded cables (my experience is many times the shielding in cables degrade the sound, my high end RCA cables are totally unshielded as are all my power cables).  After looking at many on line selected this one.  After about 400 hours of run in on the cable and DAC I am totally floored at how good this cable sounds, 75 foot nonetheless and so inexpensive, going into my Naim amp.  Truly amazing.  My guess is the copper must be of high quality.  Highly recommended when one needs a long RCA cable!"
1026,4,"the unit is a nice box, small, sturdy and made of metal with a light powder coating, definitely better than expected. The only issue i had is that  i couldn't get it to work with my non compliant HDCP Pioneer Plasma screen PDP-434 that i purchased in 2003. I read most of the reviews and it seemed like it would work, but my 11 year old plasma screen would not support the HD refresh rate from the Roku 3 box and the frequency could not be changed on the monitor. I did call Pioneer up and spoke to their level 2 tech support and the tech said basically \\""you are hosed, go get yourself a new LED/plasma\\""    My pioneer plasma only has DVI input not hdmi so i was need to strip the HDCP from the video and split the audio to optical TOS-Link into the AV receiver. Yes, i know, my equipment is ancient s***, but i paid $4,300 for the plasma back in the day and that was a wholesale price. I did get the audio to split, but getting the video out of the Roku 3 box was not happening.    Basically the j-tech box is a passive pass-thru de-embedder that will strip the vid and audio and probably removes the HDCP from the HDMI signal.***    Lastly the middle pictures on the description is misleading, no fault of theirs. The picture is actually the front of the unit and the back of the unit in one picture... They really should have taken two photos to show the front and the back of the unit. Instead of thinking it is the back of the unit. The back of the unit is the RCA outputs.    *** HDCP was a copy protection added in 2004 to protect the media giants from piracy. The only problem was that HD monitor were sold in 2003 and earlier at a penetration rate of 10% prior to the High Def Copy Protection. So in other words, the 3-4 million early adopters of plasma monitors that spent thousands of $$$ got hosed by the manufacturers."
1027,5,"Great ,I really am enjoying this product with all of it's features. Easy to carry around and battery life last at least 10 + hours."
1028,3,"We noted that this device takes twice as long to deliver it's cleaning, doesn't actually repair anything but it will clean.  Be careful though, it leaves imbedded scratches in the repair mode."
1029,5,The remote Worked right out if the box as advertised. I am very pleased with the product. Thanks so much!
1030,4,Worked for me in Central Fl. Had to find window facing west to Orlando to get Fox and CBS in my block house. 50 channels overall but many are college or public broadcast. Signal solid except in worst storm conditions. Needs power source.
1031,5,as expected from apple.. this is an awesome product. its like an iphone without the cellular data and call. i would recommend this.
1032,5,"Simple to setup. Simple to use. I broke my headphone jack and hate having external usb speakers. This was a lifesaver. Plus the quality is loud, clear, and really freaking good. Had them for a quite a while and have every blue tooth device attached to it lol. I will be playing a video off of the computer to listening music from my phone to my kid watching netflix from the tablet. AWESOME buy and I am going to buy the sub and some other speakers with this now because this is good. I don't need them because the quality of this but I want them now lol. I say its better then sono and close rival with bose."
1033,4,"What I do like is the USB port, the car charger, and that you can charge batteries fast seeing when they are finished.<br /><br />What I don't like and will blame on Sanyo Eneloop AA 16 Pack NiMH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries is that I only get a 30-45 minute life out of these batteries. I play with 6 at a time with my Lazer Tag LTX. With store Energizer and Kirkland I get 6 hours. I'll give it a 4 and have to try out some other batteries."
1034,1,I bought three new SanDisk players in the last six years.<br />All went to hell after two years.<br />Never again a SanDisk player!
1035,4,"Very prompt delivery via amazon prime. The clock set up was a tad complicated in that I needed the manual to set it, (a typical problem of far to many contemporary compliances - what happened to the design process) But with book in hand the clock was relatively easy to set up. Some how the time automatically was set right out the box, but it is about 3 minutes off from the correct time. I decided to leave &#34;well enough&#34; alone, no need to mess around with the space time continuum.<br /><br />The clock display light was way to bright (the dimmer was practically useless), contrary to some reviews here. But it was an easy fix. I just bought a pack of colored transparent book report covers and  literally cut and pasted a display cover. (for me it was two light colors). Also the projected clock display is a red color as shown in the sample - I prefer blue (too bad no choice). However the projected time has a fine wall display, although I would have preferred a different font display than that digital one. Digital fonts tend to get confusing with some numbers. And finally there was not enough pointing options for the project clock. A more flexible projector arm would have been nice although that is probably a feature in the more expensive projection clocks.<br /><br />Still, I love this clock. The clock is projected at almost the perfect angle on the wall for me.  I can easily see it with minimal turning when I wake up. While I haven't overslept yet, I am waking up a little more relaxed. It's projection clocks from now on for me."
1036,5,"This is the 2nd one I've personally bought (loved it so much had to get another for another room), and have several friends that have also purchased it. I've had my first one for over a year without an issue. Highly recommended!"
1037,1,"This antenna is a piece of JUNK.  It came out of the box with the cable connector BROKEN, only the nut on the connector kept it from falling out (or in). The threaded connector is a pressed into a u-shaped piece that is soldered to a circuit board.  Of course the pressed piece fell apart BEFORE I opened the box.  The connectors on the amplifier are of similar junk construction.  And you get the same channel reception with or without this thing connected!!"
1038,5,"Starting with a product packaging, I was very pleased with details of a high quality &#34;gift box&#34; presentation. With so many companies trying to out do each other with flashy graphics of the packaging, here you start off with an elegant mystery black box and only a gold print of the company name. Once you lift the top cover, you reveal jewelry like presentation of HM-700 and RE-400B right next to each other. When I originally saw a picture of HM-700 on HiFiMAN website, I assumed it was a 3D rendering because it looked very minimalistic and non-traditional. I didn't realize that's exactly how it's going to look out of the box - a futuristic looking gadget from some si-fi movie. With a small footprint fitting in a palm of your hand, it weights only 3 oz with a compact dimensions of 105mm x 49mm x 12mm. The top half of HM-700 has LCD screen (2&#34;), then 3 unmarked cylindrical copper color buttons in the middle (volume -/+, and power/hold in between), and a flat area at the bottom which houses 4 hidden directional (up, down, right, left) buttons. I actually never experienced a gadget with such touch controls where its a physical contact button concealed under a surface layer. At the bottom corner on the left side you have 3.5mm headphone jack (TRRS balanced output, location is more convenient for right angle connectors) and on the opposite right side a standard micro-usb connector (for charging, data transfer, and adapter), and also at the bottom edge a small pinhole port for a reset (which btw I never had to use even once - the firmware is solid!!!). As part of included accessories you get a soft velour drawstring pouch and a screen cleaning cloth, usb to micro-usb cable, and two adapter cables (more about it later). The included RE-400B are super lightweight aluminum housing in-ear headphones which come with a number of their own accessories including a total of 8-pairs of custom eartips (not the generic type, but actual custom design), 5-pairs of replacementfilters, and a shirt clip. Furthermore, an armband case was included as an accessory bonus to use HM-700 during your exercising.<br /><br />HM-700 packs a very impressive spec for a portable DAP with 32GB of on-board flash, battery life of 15 hours, and support for various music formats including WAV, MP3, ACE, FLAC (16bit), and WAV (24bit, 44.1/48kHz). Obviously, it's not designed to carry your terabyte hi-res FLAC library, but considering it's portable nature - it has plenty of room. The interface is very minimalistic, though took me a few minutes of getting used to because of lack of OK/enter button. I didn't realize how that became embedded into my thumb operation. Here, OK button is also the Right button. While Back button is also a Left button. Up/Down works to scroll through the list, as well as Fast forward/back. Long press of Right button also brings up a menu with more options. And there are plenty of those (options)! In reality, you don't need any instructions, just a few minutes to get used to UI navigation and various menu options. The disadvantage of such minimalistic control is that some functions take extra clicks to get to, but it's very intuitive with a relative fast UI response. Display doesn't have the highest resolution, but we are not talking about video player or smarphone, and I found it perfectly adequate for song artwork view. Inside of the house, I had no problem with a display view, but it got a little harder outside in a direct sunlight where I think a piece of anti-glare screen protector would come handy. Before I proceed with sound quality, let me first go into more details about included RE-400B in-ear headphones.<br /><br />For anybody wondering, &#34;B&#34; in this headphone model stands for Balanced to work directly with Balanced TRRS output of HM-700. HiFiMAN decided to give us a taste of high end balanced output architecture in a scaled down package. So what does this mean? Can you use a regular headphones plugged into HM-700 directly? Sure, though they won't sound to it's full potential due to a topology of a single &#34;hot&#34; wire per L/R channel connection instead of a balanced differential connection. In general it will not sound worse than plugged into your regular mp3 player or a lot of the smartphones. But if you are ready to step up to a higher audio quality, RE-400B will be waiting for you with their detailed warm neutral sound. Nothing really is over-emphasized in there, and it delivers a tonal balance across entire frequency range. Bass is very detailed with a nice fast punch, nothing is exaggerated, though bassheads will find the quantity on a low side. Mids have a great definition and clarity, with a natural delivery of vocals. Treble sparkle is there, but not over-emphasized which gives a touch of warmth to the sound. There is no hint of sibilance and they are perfect for extended listening. Microphonics effect is hardly noticeable either. Thanks to a balanced architecture, the soundstage is wide and very realistic like you are in the room with an artist or at the concert. What is great, HiFiMAN provided a short 3.5mm wire adapter which converts/terminates balanced output to a standard unbalanced so you can connect RE-400B to any audio player or smartphone/tablet to enjoy their sound. And wise versa, they also included an adapter which connects to audio jack and micro-usb jack of HM-700 in order to attach any unbalanced headphone to enjoy high quality sound. My only gripe, I wish they would have used a thicker wire/shielding with that adapter, or perhaps built it into a lanyard connection.<br /><br />There are definitely a lot of options to use HM-700 and RE-400B together and in conjunction with other audio players and headphones. To comment on a sound of HM-700 + RE-400B or with HM-700 and other headphones through an adapter - I found it to be of a high quality. The #1 challenge with any audio hardware is being able to reproduce a sound without adding coloration. In my opinion, HM-700 delivered that with high marks. For a seasoned audiophile, they might find it a bit colder/digital in comparison to some other high end equipment, but I personally would consider that minor for portable use. For those on the go with an active lifestyle who value a high quality sound and don't want to bring along your bulkier, expensive, and more fragile DAPs - I can't think of a better alternative than HM-700. Just strap HM-700 to your arm, with included armband, plug in RE-400B with their amazing passive noise isolation (just choose the correct eartip) - and dive into an amazing world of audio, uncluttered by text messages and email interruptions or social media updates!<br /><br />Overall, some people might have a polarizing opinion about HM-700. $250 for mp3 player is a lot of money. But if you start to think about what you are actually getting - this becomes a bargain. The player design is a head-turner that will get attention anywhere you go. It's super compact and durable (just google YT video of HM-700 falling test - it's insane!!!). You get 32GB of storage and 15hr of extended battery life, not to mention a universal micro-usb connection. The included bonus RE-400B headphone by itself is a gem and worth every penny of its original $99 price tag. Now, factor in all the accessories, eartips, adapter cables, and armband... hopefully you see my point. Is this a must have gadget for everyone? Not really. But if you value a sound quality on the go, I would give HM-700/RE-400B combo a serious consideration!"
1039,5,"Was just looking for some new earphones that were decent enough.<br /><br />My last pair of earphones were Apple's Earpod that came with every Apple device.<br /><br />Comparing to those, these are pretty similar.<br /><br />Awesome earphones for the price.<br />Bass is nice (something I look for) and cancel a decent amount of surrounding sound. They fit real well in my ear."
1040,3,The BudLoks have kind of sorted my problem of earphones not staying in my ears however if you are doing cardio for any extended length of time & become sweaty they tend to start to slide out. Using the BudLoks is better than how things were before i got them but they are not the be all & end all solution I was looking for.
1041,3,"Good device. BUT be careful. I recommended this to a friend who after the 2nd day complained that one of the outputs didn't work. I looked at it and sure enough, the emitter for one of the two outputs was dark. I suspect my non techie pal, pushed the TOS cable in too far, but AMAZON replaced it just the same and I insisted that he buy the Monoprice armored Optical Toslink cables with the swivel connections to prevent any repeats.<br />Never satisfied, my only desire would a  multi channel, eg 4 inputs and 2 outputs selected independently."
1042,5,"My bluetooth headphones charge with this kind of cable.  It's an odd cable, so I was always stressed about breaking or losing the cable.  Now, I have one for the car, home, and work, plus the original one.  So, with four of these cables, I have one less worry in life.  These work great, just like the original cable."
1043,4,"Works great. Be warned: you will need a 5V power adapter if the HDMI ports on your TV do not power devices. My only issue is that the blue LED is too bright, so there is a large area behind my TV that glows blue. Better placement fixes this issue, though."
1044,5,I dare you to try to buy this many batteries for this price!  You will pay the same amount at Radio Shack for just one battery.
1045,3,I dont own these. but i was genuinely  wondering where you guys get your children from to make the leather?
1046,5,For the price (paid 300$)  this system give you an amazing sound.  Best speakers if you are on a budget.
1047,3,I tested out in store and it's sound very nice but at home it's sound okay. Maybe the music that's for display made headphone sound great.
1048,5,"The sound for this earbud is great. The highs are crisp and clear and the bass is strong and tight. Most importantly, the bass does not smear into the mids.<br />At first I thought that the 6mm driver is not going to produce the bass that I have with a 12.5mm audio technica earbud. But I was wrong. This little earbud produces bass that is clean and deep. Not those boom boom bass but it goes thumm thumm.<br />The sound stage is good too. You are able to hear the distinct sound of instruments coming from the different angle. The sound is lively.<br />Overall, creative has done a great job making this little earbud for all the Android phone users to enjoy great music. And don't forget, it comes with a mic."
1049,5,Took this with me on my Euro trip this past summer and the product worked perfectly everywhere I visited. It seems pretty durable  and hope to use it again soon.
1050,5,"My one use for this product was to split the Hdmi signal from my AppleTV(3rd gen) to 1) an Hdmi input on my Yamaha receiver and 2) an analog audio input on the same receiver. Because Zone 2 on the amplifier will process only the unit's analog inputs, this is the only way to run audio from the AppleTV to Zone 2 (patio speakers in my case.) After reading many reviews for many similar products I chose the Premium Quality Hdmi To Hdmi + 3.5mm Stereo Audio Extractor Converter for my project.<br /><br />The factors I read in the reviews and bore true in final usage were these:<br />1) Both the Hdmi passthrough signal and the analog RCA output remain active at all times -- no switching required.<br />2) The passed through Hdmi signal seems to be as strong as the original. (No picture loss on anything I've watched so far including a 1920x1080 H.264 23551 kbps video streamed from my iTunes on the Home Sharing computer.)<br /><br />The unit is powered by a 5V USB power supply with the cable included. The one thing I would wish for on this unit would be a USB power supply. It clearly stated in the description that it was not included so I can't ding the product for not including it. It would be nice if they even sold one as an add-on for $3-5. As is I had an extra one that I use on trips. I'll now have to &#34;steal one&#34; for my next trip.<br /><br />All in all this purchase has been everything I hoped for. I now can watch movies from my AppleTV inside and step outside and listen to my playlists out on the patio. Thanks J-Tech!"
1051,1,"Does not come with a power adapter. Purchased one, and the product still won't work or turn on. Avoid this products."
1052,1,"Please do not buy this little peace of s***,the battery last for like an hour and the screen is easy to crack total waste of my money."
1053,1,"I received the item in a timely manner. However, it was not at all what I expected.  It didn't fit my Mach Speed Trio Stealth. If anyone is looking for a charger for this particular tablet, I certainly would NOT recommend this item. I kept the charger because it fits a cheaper 7&#34; RCA tablet which I bought for my six year for Christmas.<br /><br />Jackie"
1054,3,"This player was a lot smaller than expected, but it's still awesome! Works wonders for hours! I didn't have to install anything on my PC in order to put songs on it either (which was a huge plus). You can easily remove music without dragging and dropping. Easy to add music, battery so far is lasting for hours. I love this thing! Best MP3 player I have owned yet. Update, within about 3-4 months it started freezing up, I completely cleaned it out and only added a few songs and it kept freezing up."
1055,5,I read lots of reviews and tried out lots speakers this is the best. Bose doesn't even come close! The beats pill Xl is the best sound for a portable.  I love the Marshall stanmor but it wasn't portable.  BestspillXL!  The best on the market for portability.
1056,3,Takes an immense amount to time to boot up. Popular apps like TuneIn radio don't amplify thro the player.<br />Bit disappointed.
1057,5,I got this for my husband for Valentine's day. He always brings his phone to the bathroom to take a shower. This little thing grabs onto the showed wall really well and syncs perfectly with both our Samsung galaxy and Iphone 5C. The volume goes up and down when you hold the right and left buttons respectively. Only takes a few hours to charge and lasts several weeks. We love it.
1058,5,"Just finished by home theatre it boy is it a great screen, I am very pleased! I was very concerned after reading about new smell of screen once its opened. I hardly noticed it after two weeks it was gone. This is a great screen the best for the money. I would definitely buy it again and highly recommend it to friends.<br /><br />OBTW I just bought another for my office."
1059,3,Worked fine as far as holding TV to the wall. It holds it too close to the wall for plugs coming out of the TV. Had to put wooden spacers between wall and bracket to get clearance. Just be prepared to put spacers. Good price and well constructed.
1060,3,"So bottom line, they fit and work. However they are not as comfortable as the original Bose.<br />I think next time ill buy the real Bose replacements"
1061,5,"A reasonably priced adapter and it works well. So far there is no issue, and I am expecting long life span."
1062,5,"Nice size, clean lines, sounds great, easy to use.  Overall a GREAT radio.  This is my second Sangean radio I highly recommend."
1063,1,"This worked great up until yesterday. I used it in the kitchen, daily. I know have to turn it up to full volume to just about hear anything, then all of a sudden it may scream out some noise at full pitch.<br /><br />If i had purchased this from a shop i am sure that it would have 1 years warranty. For $120 i feel that i have been shafted. I want a replacement but can i find a real person to speak to about this?.......of course not!<br /><br />Very unsatisfied customer!"
1064,5,Works great!  Installing it is a little bit of an issue.  You need two people without a doubt but it is well worth it.  It works wonderfully!!
1065,5,"Not sure what to say but its a wire, but I will say the it was high in the rating and it is a lot less in price than many retailers,. So the best i could say is that it is the best bang for your buck."
1066,5,"The Mohu Leaf 50 antenna was easy to install, Saves me $70.00 a month in cable bills and I get ABC, NBC, and FOX"
1067,3,"This is an &#34;okay&#34; product, but not great. I only use it for workout/running but there is something wrong with the headphone input (or whatever it's called), and the sound cuts in and out when it moves much...which is a lot while running! I also had to buy new earbuds because the factory ones are ridiculously uncomfortable. It serves its purpose, but if I could go back I would have just ponied up the dough for a newer or better model."
1068,4,"Works OK, For critical tuning an analog display may be more helpful. But not necessary. An Input/Output ports are not necessary. No other comments."
1069,2,"I'm afraid I Have almost nothing good to say about this product!! Almost as soon as I received them,one earphone immediately stopped working altogether,for no apparent reason! I am certain that I did absolutely nothing to damage them. These earbuds,were also a little bit more exspensive then some of the other ones I've ordered,so for the things to half totally stop working almost as soon as I got them,is just intolerable. maybe,it was just a fluke,and this particular pair was totally flawed for some strange reason,but either way,I don't think I will ever order another thing from sennheiser again,if I can help it.  Because of my experience with these,I wouldn't recommend them to anybody."
1070,5,Gives you multiple options on how you can mount speakers which I consider to be very important when setting up new speakers.
1071,5,"I putted this idem in a dish antenna, and after adjusted, working excellent and now i can enjoy my favorite programs"
1072,4,"These headphones are just your ordinary headphones you could buy anywhere. They have pretty good sound, they are being sold for a reasonable price, and they last about 3 months. I ordered another pair after my last ones broke about two days ago."
1073,5,"I've had it for over 3 months now, and it works great.  I've only charged the batteries once and they're still running strong in my Nitro RC Yokomo GT-4 with Turigy GT3 Radio."
1074,5,These are my favorite headphones.  They last and they're the perfect size for my little ears.  AND they have the best sound quality of any earbuds I've ever had because they fit perfect!!  Love them!
1075,5,"I purchased this neat little stereo so i can have it at my desk at work. It was packaged very well and I have zero complaints about the delivery time. I did try to pair it with my phone but for some reason the \\""BIGBOX\\"" signal didn't show up on my phone. So I tried my girlfriends phone and also my computer. Still I was not getting a signal. So I did try and plug my phone in to the AUX port just to test the sound. I was amazed that the sound was pretty good. Especially good for the $35 i paid for it. So I emailed DKnight and they ran me through some troubleshooting just to make sure it was not user error. (The instructions are super clear, so it should be really easy to pair with any bluetooth device). to make a long story short the seller was very quick to all of my responses and are shipping me out a replacement. they put a 100% guarantee that the next one will work. It should be here within the next 1 or 2 days.<br /><br />10/10 I would buy from these guys again.<br /><br />EDIT: Got the replacement and works great! sound is awesome and super easy to pair with my phone. well worth the 30 bucks."
1076,5,The price is right that we are very happy. Especially helps at night when you don't want to wake people up and we want to watch a special movie the sound is wonderful and the clarity of the words is even better
1077,5,"Fits most types of audio needs. Very nice set of adapters. Good Quality. A must have, for audio on the go."
1078,5,I bought these to replace a different model of Philips wired headphones that I really like but the wire was shorting out (in my old pair).  This is my first pair of Bluetooth headphones. I knew before I bought them that the Bluetooth sound quality was not going to be near as good as when you use the included wire. It's easy enough to google best bluetooth sound quality before you buy them to check for yourself.<br /><br />But when you plug in the wire that comes with the headphones the sound quality is excellent! I am beyond happy with these headphones. I'll use Bluetooth only when listening to audio books because spoken word does not need high quality to sound good.<br /><br />As far as I am concerned these are a perfect pair of WIRED (wink wink) headphones.
1079,5,"The charger works well.  It doesn't indicate it is charging, but when I leave it plugged in the battery reaches 100% after a few hours."
1080,1,worked for a month and then the time set buttons stopped working. I am left with a cd player with an annoying 12:00 flashing
1081,5,"These headphones literally change my whole perspective on my taste of music. I bought these with the intention of having headphones that allow me to still hear sound around me, which for some people isn't good. Everything is so clear on these headphones, I can hear every little instrument. I could've easily bought some Bose but these are great. One issue I had was the fact that the cord is kinda long but these are for indoor listening but there too good just to hear at home. Might be my go to go to brand if I need an upgrade"
1082,4,"The sound quality is pretty good, and the headphones feel very durable. The only bad this i can say is after about an hour and a half they started to hurt a little. For the price i believe these are really good quality headphones."
1083,5,"Replaced the old Harman, with this model, never disappointed beautiful sound, packing was great, shipping was great, everything is great with Harmon.......Thank you!"
1084,4,it was 50 dollars but on sale it is 40 lol anyways... sounds good sometimes disconnects the bluetooth saposably i am far away when i am like closer then 3 feet away but sometimes i can go 5 ft away and it sounds but still discounts me i don't know why... it has a wireless bluetooth and a connecting thing to plug in to mp3 or tv!!
1085,4,Had been putting this to great use! Very easy to transport with the folding design! Highly recommended product for all the Reggae-Heads of the world!
1086,5,"Easy to use, looks good & great sound.  I've had this for about 3 months & am happy with it."
1087,5,"It's the perfect size for using in a car or traveling. The flat cable also seems easier to handle. Additionally, the connectors have a small foot print so it can be used with most smart phone cases and audio setups. Thumbs up!"
1088,1,The head set broke in a week an a half after I received it during used was very disappointed. The headset sure do work great but the ear hook is very poorly built that my opinion.
1089,5,"I believe the functionality of this remote is covered well in other reviews.  I'll add that we have 8 of these in different rooms, some going direct to a TV, in some cases to a receiver, and in some cases through an Audio Authority video matrix router.  It handles all cases well.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to have an installer give me a copy of the software, and seem to be able to get IR updates.  But if you are NOT a professional installer, I have no idea how you'd use this.  You really do need the software, and if you components are less than about 5 years old, you need the IR database updates as well.<br /><br />I do not blame URC, as can you imagine them trying to support a remote this complicated for end users?  I can't, and that's probably why they only deal with professional installers."
1090,3,This product is ok and was necessary for me to get sound out of my Wii U before they updated their software. I am using a receiver that doesn't support HDMI audio and before the latest update you either had to use the HDMI or the Analog and not both.<br /><br />Now you can use an eForCity HDTV / EDTV High Definition 480p Component AV Cable for Nintendo or similar product to get sound for your Wii U.<br /><br />my biggest complaints are the extremely bright LED lights and having to cycle through the inputs to get to your desired device.<br />You can use the remote to change directly to the desired input but that is more of a nuisance than a blessing I would rather not use this device at all.
1091,1,Very disappointed! For the price I paid I don't feel like I got the quality expected. I purchased these for my husband who flies frequently for business. He has used them several times but during our last trip out discovered 1 side of the headphones is now not working. Seems a shame that I spent so much for good quality that didn't last 2 months. Buyer beware!
1092,5,"I bought this for a large flat screen TV in my home that is in the corner of the room. Depending on where you sit the viewing angle can be awkward and this device solves that issue. I was hesitant about the quality of this at first as the first one I ordered came broken and fell apart in shipping. i was able to return it quickly and order another without any problems. This second unit came intact and requires no setup. Just plop it down and set your TV on top, done. It's only been a few days but i like it and it feels stable but I wouldn't recommend spinning the TV quickly - just because physics."
1093,3,"In all fairness I am not sure who to blame, but the package contents were in disarray. The unit came in with one side assembled and the other not. That was strange. I wondered if it had been returned and I got a somewhat used item. There were many scratches on all of the bolts and nuts leading me to conclude that someone had partially assembled it, got frustrated and returned it. The left side was together and the right was not. Weirdly, everything with a metal washer was attached. The package with the screws seemed untouched and pristine, sort of like someone tossed in a new package. I ended up with lots of extra screws, but just enough washers??<br /><br />As for the unit itself, I like the ease of adjustment and the full articulation. The mounting process is probably not easy for newbies, but if you've done this before and you know what to expect, it's okay.<br /><br />Final suggestion: The whole thing assembled folds nice and flat in a rectangular package. So why not assemble them at the factory and ship them pre-assembled in flat thin rectangular packages. Offer instructions for those wanting different assembly options. Then people may not become frustrated and return them. It may cost a few pennies more for the assembly, but Cheetah will undoubtedly get fewer returns and there will be less chance of customers getting partially assembled units?"
1094,3,"For an entry level SDR this device hits the price point. It is 'entry level', and does work. There are other SDR units that are more sensitive and capable, but if you're curious and want to tinker, you can start here.<br /><br />My only negative comment would be related to amount of time for shipment (3+ weeks)."
1095,5,Needed this item to plug my phone into my car stero.  Works perfectly with my Samsung phone.  I would recommend this item.
1096,5,A perfect solution to my problem of multiple monitors of different brands and connection hitched to a computer GPU. Also found that the GPU ran cooler when using just LCD monitors rather than a mix of LCD/LED monitors. That would not have been discovered without this adapter.
1097,1,It would be nice to know before purchase that you cannot text an iPod to a iPhone!!!  We knk k
1098,5,"I was initially shocked that this part in the t.v. would die within two years.  Samsung was horrifically unhelpful continuously blaming the remote when it was clearly more.  They really were driving you to send it in to one of their repair people.  Even though I bought the unit in the U.S., I live outside. Can we say warranty phobia!  It took me 15 min. to replace this part once I realized the fault.  Once installed it worked flawlessly for now.  The board is heating up too much such that I foresee this happening again. Luckily the part is relatively inexpensive."
1099,4,"Connected to Antennacraft U4000 in attic with 75' coax cable.<br />Basically no gain within 25 miles. Did not receive more stations because all were received anyway before installing<br />Lna 200. Antenna pointed slightly towards Cincinnati about 40 miles away. No gain for Dayton. Here are results for<br />the further stations from Cincy.  Channel 5.1 w/o amp 87 percent strength. With preamp 93 to 100.<br />Channel 9.1 w/o 84 percent, with 87 to 93. Channel 12.1 which is high VHF not proper antenna used, w/o amp 69 to 75. With 72 to 78. Channel 19.1 w/o amp 78 to 81 percent. With 87 to 93 percent. Channel 48.1 w/o 81 to 84 percent.<br />With 87 to 93 percent. Channel 64.1 w/o 81 to 84 and with 87 to 93 signal strength on TV. Tested today which is very<br />cloudy. No splitter was used. Easy install. Decided to keep because of the gains which would be good for bad weather.<br />Liked the USB power connected to the TV instead of wall outlet. Not crazy about cable ties but not a deal breaker being mounted in attic.  Getting ready to connect another antenna up to ditch Direct TV. This antenna will be outside with half<br />the cable run. I am not sure if a booster would be needed in that case.  If needed I would buy the Lna-200 again even with the ties. This booster has some gain, easy to install and really just not that expensive. Did not see any overload.<br />Hope this info is of some use. Amazon prime video and shipping is awesome!<br /><br />Thanks for reading,<br />Dan"
1100,5,"I originally bought this to use on an older tv that doesn't have hdmi ports, and it did not work for Sony's Playstation 4.  However it worked great for other devices i utilized it for"
1101,1,Can't get good signal no metter where to place it get some Chanel's but loose lot more not happy at all
1102,1,Can't rate player as it never played.  Described as 'like new' it had damage on the face plate and top of unit.  I knew Amazon would negotiate an adjustment so I hooked up the unit.  I loaded 5 commercial CDs and waited and waited as it took over a minute to read each one (actually timed) and then showed 'no disc' in all five positions.  Spoke with Michael at tech support who walked me through all possible fixes with no success.  This unit is on it's way back and I ordered another 'like new' with my fingers crossed.  I'll check the next one and update.
1103,5,"This is great to have for anyone who likes to travel and doesn't trust the all in one converters. These are a bit heavy when packaged together, so it is usually a good idea to grab only the ones you need if you're like me and prefer backpacking to lugging  a huge suitcase"
1104,5,"These Panasonic Headphones are easily the best headphones I've found for the price in a long time! They have a great sound, deep bass, and fantastic clarity! Just try not to turn them up too high! The bass might blow you away! The regular price for these headphones is $55.99, but I paid only $24.99 for these headphones on amazon and these headphones gave me the same sound quality of headphones in the $80-$100 range! Not only that, but I also got a 24k gold plated plug and an extension cord which is perfect for me because I use these headphones to connect to my guitar amp and my Kenwood receiver, so I needed headphones with a long cord. The headphones also swivel for a compact design and come with a carrying pouch so you can carry your headphones with you on the go. You get a truly amazing deal with these headphones that you don't get with most headphones! I don't think these are the best headphones money can buy, but who can afford $300 headphones? I would recommend these headphones to everyone that wants a great pair of headphones, but can't afford to shell out $100-$300 for the best headphones."
1105,5,Everything went smoothly with the order and delivery.  This is exactly what I expected it to be. Glad to have it.
1106,5,It does the job well. I love the flexibility for running between my S4 and the MP3 port in my rig.
1107,5,"There is &#34;generally&#34; no lag (I will explain later). I use this to connect to my TV and play games and watch movies. I connect it to my rooted Nexus 7 FHD. I use a PS3 controller via the Sixaxis app from the play store. There is NO lag when doing this at all. I have played NOVA 3, GTA Vice City, Asphalt 8, a few others and some emulators with GREAT SUCCESS.<br /><br />Now let me explain the generally. I have a 26&#34; TV in my bedroom and it connected with no problem and NO lag. It is a walmart brand ILO TV and it out performs any other TV I have EVER bough. I have a 32&#34; Panasonic in my living room and when I hook this up to it there is a NOTICEABLE lag. But then again, I had to download an app to change the resolution on my tablet before the TV would recognize it.<br /><br />With some testing, here is what I found out:<br />-The lag is NOT caused by the app, as I used the app the change the resolution and hooked it up to my bedroom TV and there is once again NO LAG.<br />-The lag is not cause by the controller. Plays fine on the bedroom TV.<br />-Now this is what I didn't expect... The lag is also present on the screen of the Nexus 7. As in it's NOT caused by the HDMI cable. I tried multiple cables by the way and used swapped cables with the TV's<br /><br />So, if you have LAG while using this device, IT MIGHT BE YOUR TV. Next time I am buying a TV, I am taking my Slimport adapter  and my Nexus 7 FHD with me and hooking it up to every TV I am interested in."
1108,4,"Took several weeks to decide between this Pro-ject and similarly priced Rega and Music Hall models. The deciding factor was the Ortofon 2M cartridge. Also got the TC-750LC phono amp that you will need if your amplifier or receiver doesn`t have a special phono input.<br /><br />Set up was easy and took less than 15 minutes once unboxed. Sound is fantastic, but I took a star off because it really struggles with 180 gr records. Hopefully it will get  better once I upgrade to the Acryl-it Platter. My guess is the metalic platter it comes originally with is too heavy."
1109,1,"Do NOT buy these if all you have is a Samsung DVD player.  They are not even recognized, even when burnt at a 4x speed.  They play fine in my Toshiba DVD player.<br /><br />Save your money if you have a Samsung player."
1110,3,"The 3 that work work very well. Last a little longer than the 800mAh that I have. However, one gives me a low ohm warning on my ZMax Mini. All in all I am pretty pleased with the price and performance."
1111,4,"This radio is unique in 3 ways:<br />1. It has 5 ways to power-up this radio: solar, hand crank, battery, a/c power adapter and can be charged from a computer with a usb cord.<br />2. It Can charge your cell phone also.<br />3. LED lights for reading and signaling.<br /><br />I gave it a 4 stars only because I just got it as a gift and haven't fully used it yet. This radio will be a necessity in an emergency."
1112,4,"It worked as it was supposed to work.  I had a composite video plus sound and an HDMI input to switch to an HDMI output.  A comment about the bright leds was true, but was fixed with pieces of paper taped over them (took off a star for the inconvenience of having to correct it myself).  It has worked flawlessly since I hooked it up."
1113,5,"I bought this to test, I was really impressed with how well it worked, it is really small and flat, you really do have to move it around to find the best spot. my TV is not near the outside wall."
1114,5,Bought this for my daughter in college about 8 months ago. She loves it. Says it sounds great and hasn't messed up yet. I mean... She's a college student... They're rough on stuff and it still works...
1115,3,I decided to take this back because the sound quality didn't seem much better than my smartphone. I'd rather fork out more money for something with better quality.
1116,1,"Just got this in the mail this morning and it came pretty fast and in 1 piece and working, that's about all the positives for me. I paid extra for this 4GB mp3 player because it says it holds up to 1000 songs I didn't know that up to 1000 meant exactly 420 songs, I feel ripped off I should of went with a player that would have gave me the space I wanted. Just BEWARE that this thing will hold 500 actual songs max! Do not believe the amount of songs this seller says it holds because it is a flat out lie! I feel like this player is a 2GB not a 4GB this mp3 player holds the same amount of music most 2GB players hold."
1117,5,"This is my second review on this product.I only gave 1 star before, as I got a dud unit.I need to tell the first part,to explain the great service I got from this company. I sent the first unit back, got my refund,and considered that the end.I wrote a review,as asked, from Amazon, expressing my disappointment. Within 2 hours I had an e-mail from the company, apologizing, and offering me a new unit, at no cost to me, which I received a couple of days ago.The unit works very well, so I am a very satisfied customer !.I am so very impressed with the great service I received,especially when I was not expecting anything.Thank you,and an A+ from me !"
1118,4,The RCA CVBS converter worked as advertised to solve my problem of having an older VCR/DVD player going to an HDMI<br />TV with only HDMI inputs.
1119,5,The radio was shipped quickly and I have used it for 3 basketball games. It brings in local stations very well and is easy to sync to the TV. I highly recommend it!
1120,5,Smooth work. Does job as expected. Hassle free. Doesn't look cheap. Can work with its  own remote control and the smart IR remote on my android smartphone
1121,2,"The headphones sound great and I absolutely love the cable setup, but there are a few problems that turn these headphones from a 5 to a 2.<br /><br />1) Build quality<br />  I used these headphones for 3(!!!) days before the superlux logo fell off the right headphone, what the hell???<br /><br />2) Size issues<br />  I have a pretty average-sized head and the little 'ears' on the top just bust through the top bars of the headphones, turning every step into audible rustling sound. The headphones also sit way too high on my ears. There is no way to adjust the size of the headphones! That is a pretty bad design flaw<br /><br />3) Comfort<br />  This is linked to the fact that the headphones are just too small. After wearing them for a couple hours my ears get stressed from being pulled upwards"
1122,5,"It's been 4 months now and these headphones are fantastic. The frequency response is nice and broad. As far as fitting onto your dome, trust me, there will be no problems with that. That was one of the main selling points. They fit completely over your ears and are slightly angled in the cups themselves to aim them directly into your audio holes. I wear them at work 4-6 hours a day as well as use them to produce our podcast. They are sealed, so your ears can get warm, but it's a small price to pay for the sound quality. Also note, give them about 2 weeks of solid use and you'll discover they really start to sound nice."
1123,5,I bought this little bag for my blue tooth.  It is great.  My Bluetooth fit in it perfectly.  I recommend this bag to anyone who does not like to just throw their blue tooth into their bag.
1124,5,Extremely happy with this purchase. Would highly recommend it to anyone considering to purchase this item.<br />I am also happy with the price.<br /><br />i
1125,5,"It is not the prettiest thing but it is absolutely simple. I first got confused because my tv didn't find any channels, then I had to program the TV to look for them- which I didn't know. After that it was lovely :) Now I have a whole bunch of channels that I never had- I am normally not a fan of TV, I use my TV as a computer monitor but I figured it would be good to have important channels on my tv in case of emergencies to watch the news.."
1126,5,"Use them while riding my bike on the rollers while exercising. Nice, lightweight. Good volume and sound.  I can watch TV or play DVD's without having the sound on the TV on full blast.<br /><br />My only knock is that  the ear cups sit flat on the ears, rather than cupping around them like most headphones I'm used to. Works fine,  but took me awhile to get used to the fit."
1127,5,I love my wireless yurbuds. They are great and almost better than my old wired set. A must for runners.
1128,4,"It Works perfectly, it is a little short that i was expecting, but it is ok, it is well made"
1129,5,My first flat screen.  It was easy to find the mount needed for the tv purchased for my bedroom.  Thanks.
1130,5,"The features listed sold me on it.  The display keeps me informed.  I have all of my computer stuff plugged in an have had several outages and no problems or concerns.  I have a monitor, large sound system, cpu, scanner, phone, portable hard drives  and printer. and not so much as a hiccup.  I had a APS Back-ups 600 which died due to the battery and did not think it was large enough.  My equipment load is greater than it was. This  high in system I currently have draws significantly more power.  I don't know how long it will last during an outage but the last outage I had was not noticeable for about 15 minutes. The house power was restored before I missed it."
1131,5,At first I was skeptical in buying a wall mount for our 55&#34; TV for such a cheap price. But this wall mount was very easy to install and it holds our TV with no issues at all. Definitely a great buy!
1132,5,Good quality cables.  I used them to connect a DVR and TV to my Sound bar.  No problems found - price was reasonable.
1133,5,"I bought this cable for my LED TV and cable box. I never cared for the heavily shielded Monster cables with the barely bendable cables, so I tried this one. For whatever reason, Samsung TVs have their HDMI connections coming out the side, so I wanted a cable that I could maneuver easily without weighing down on the HDMI connection (the heavier cable pulled down on it, thought it would break the connection over time). I could not be happier with this cable. It's much lighter, and doesn't take up a lot of space behind your components with all the other cables. I plan on buying another one for my blu-ray player."
1134,2,"Got the color my daughter wanted and she was excited about it on Christmas day. Arrived on time. As she opened and pulled out of package, earbuds stripped from wires. :( Unhappy Mom, disappointed daughter. Now she just uses the left ear bud and lets the right one hang cause that's cool too! :/"
1135,5,This screen was easy to set up and easy to take down. It fulfilled the need that I had for a portable screen.
1136,2,"I like that it swivels, but I bought it because it has both normal outlets and USB, and my iPad and iPod  won't charge in these USB ports."
1137,5,"sealed with factory packaging, perfect quality. I would recommend these to anyone. Legit monster products without any fakes at all."
1138,3,"Bought this for my grandma because she has a whole bunch of family videos that she has of her children and grandchildren that she doesn't want to lose. So, I bought this to help so that we could either:<br />A. Back them up on an external hard drive and plug them into the projector or watch on the TV.<br />B. Burn them to discs so she can slowly dispose of the closet full of vhs tapes and condense them into just a book of movies.<br /><br />But the instructions are practically good for laying down bedding for a lizard or hamster or if you are out of toilet paper and really needed a desperate wipe... Basically a really cool idea, but your gonna have to wing it on how this item works.<br />If I knew I would post them, but all I can get out of it is audio. Good luck and hope this helps."
1139,5,"Let me start out by saying id you are looking to blast music with tons of bass look elsewhere.<br />So why am I giving it 5 stars?<br />I was looking for a speaker for in the office.  I listen to mostly podcasts and some music.  If you have the speaker close to you on moderate volume, it is clear, sounds great and if your door is open, or are in a cube, it will not disturb anyone around you.  Its a great stealth speaker.<br />Also the battery life is great.  I am using an auxiliary cable, so this might help, but I am getting much more than the promised 5 hours- more like over 10.  It does not take up much room on a crowded desk.<br />The build quality looks to be excellent.  The speaker grill and metallic ring appear to be stainless.  The speaker weighs more than ones 2-3 times as big.  One note of caution- the weight and apparent quaility could be because of the use of metal- I cannot comment on the actual speaker build quality besides the fact it sounds great for its size.<br /><br />Update:<br />Been using it with bluetooth much more: I have to say this speaker is the easiest and fastest to pair I have ever used."
1140,1,If I could give it a zero I would . What's the point in selling an iPod that is no longer supported by apple . Can't install any apps on it because iOS 4.3 can't be installed . So all it is know is a 100$ paper weight
1141,5,"Bought this to replace one that wore out after long, hard use. Works great and functions exactly as described. (Still needed more words to be able to post review)."
1142,5,Good sound fidelity  easy to set up  do need yolk adapter clean design  just wish light to show ear fones turned on
1143,5,Have been using this Brand for over 10 years.<br />Quality made item.<br />Great storage for CD/DVD with saved info/pictures or movies.<br />Can also be used to replace the bulky cases purchased DVDs come in.<br />Very good price compared to many others.
1144,1,"at such a low price compared to the real thing, when I ordered it, I was not too enthused.<br />it took over 2 weeks, because it actually shipped from China, in a yellow zip bag. ( love all those china mail stamps! )<br />8 gb is great size, and I love the drag an drop in Win Explorer, and it does not require creating a play list like my Sansa clip.<br />the supplied ear buds are duds! My Sony wrap a round's are the bomb, ( working out, cutting the lawn, tanning, etc. ) and is great with the Sansa, but with this player, no way.<br />Even at top volume its way too low, and quiet.<br />I can actually hear the birds chirping in the back yard with this thing on high volume!<br /><br />What I did, was relegate it to the Camaro.<br />I can load it up with songs, plug it in, and hear exactly what I want.<br />Many times XM plays weird crap. . . so in the car, is it as loud as the exhaust system? hahaha<br />no, the player could still be louder.<br />its ok, but still too soft<br />My relatives kid wants it, and next time I am out there, he will probably get it, and be happy.<br />Problem with the Sansa? its body is plastic, and the plastic hinge has broken off 2 I have bought. . . I am not that rough!<br />So, the metal clip appealed to me, I tried it, and lost. $3.99 flop.<br /><br /> should have got the apple metal body, but it was only 2 gb!  ouch"
1145,4,These shelves are sturdy but move horizontally.  Look great and easy to install.  The cord chase will fit several cords but is limited when using multiple coax or thicker cords.  Didn't even bother putting the plastic cover over the cords.  Existing cords were black and blended well with the color of the chase.
1146,5,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he LOVES it. My husband listens to music all the time in the house but he hates the commercials. He loves his internet radio, NO COMMERCIALS!!"
1147,4,"Can't beat this for $8. My original Vizio remote died, and batteries did not do it.  I thought it would be a lot but the replacement is just like the original and works great.  Good deal."
1148,5,"This transformer does its job correctly, I can't complain at all. I've used it many times already and never failed."
1149,5,"these sound great, great mids n crispy highs, but they lack the deep bass my skull candys have, but they sound much better on the high end overall, I have used these everyday for months and yes im rough on them, no problems at all."
1150,4,Gives you 3 years of protection for your electronics. Why not use it for your electronics. I bought mine for my Klipsch audio system.
1151,5,"Honestly, I don't really care of the difference between hdmi brands and quality because I can never tell. But, this will all end soon as I start buying more higher grade electronics.<br /><br />This cable is very good. Blue is my favorite color. Long enough to reach my bed from my TV, so I can sit in bed and use the TV as a monitor. Very Nifty!"
1152,3,"I had trouble with blue tooth,plus the battery would not charge.but when it got it together the sound was sweet."
1153,5,"Sangean has done a great job in not only making a rugged radio but a quality radio.<br /><br />Some of my household portable radios will lose the battery  cover just by being dropped on the floor. This is the radio to have whether working in the garage, going camping, or the job site. Aside from the guardrails, this radio is splash-proof, and has a large speaker that can make it heard over most background noise. Yellow case for best visibility.<br /><br />That said,it's also a quality receiver. No splatter from nearby stations and the daytime AM range is up to 150 miles daytime AM and 50 miles FM range. It has 5 presets for AM and 5 for FM for one button access to those favorite stations. Large digital readout, but be aware there is no clock or alarm in this unit.<br /><br />If you have to deal with conditions that would break ordinary household radios, then the LB-100 is the right radio for the right job."
1154,5,Well made product strong cable and easy to install. I notice also my sound quality is top notch. I recommend this product 100%.
1155,5,"THE WAS FAST SHIPPING. IT WAS VERY EASY TO APPLY.  mY CHILD APPLIED IT HERSELF WITH NO HELP, NO BUBBLES OR WRINKLES. MY CHILD LOVED IT."
1156,5,"I purchased the Bose Solo speaker base at Costco and could not help but feel ripped off for what I received.  Minimal sound improvement, no features and an empty wallet.  When I found this speaker I though I would give it a shot.  It was half the price and it offers blutooth.  I'm so happy I did!  Not only does this system sound better than the Bose Solo, it turns off and on with your TV!  It learns your remote control and offers Blutooth!  Don't pay more for the Bose Solo!  This offers way more for less."
1157,4,"The packaging for this remote is beautiful, Logitech obviously spent good money and plenty of time designing the box. Too bad they didn't spend the same amount of effort designing the setup process and documentation.<br /><br />I tried and tried and tried to set up the hub using the iPhone app (as instructed by the included setup guide), it just wouldn't ever update the firmware (no option to skip this step). The first step in the setup process is to create a myharmony.com account, so on a frustrated whim I plugged the hub into my computer (it comes with a usb cord), and logged into myharmony.com; voila setup was complete in mere minutes with zero further headaches! This option is not in any of the included setup documentation in the box, but I find it a far superior process.<br /><br />Once the Hub is setup, the app syncs quickly with no problems. It's nearly brilliant! The IR range on the hub is fantastic, and the convenience of integrated blue tooth is great. This little gizmo has reduced not just the number of remotes, but reduced the number of other adapters needed to power everything (ps3, xbox, etc.)<br /><br />App interface is really nice for the most part. There can be excessive screen changing if what you want to do isn't part of any of your predefined actions, but mostly, as long as you stick with predefined actions, using your phone as the remote works really well. But if you want to control a specific device (say change the surround sound parameters on your av receiver for example), look out!<br /><br />The device specific remote layouts within the app (iPad and iPhone) are pretty terrible. The UX team didn't even seem to try and make the remotes translate to the screen in any meaningful or useful way. A wonderful feature would be the ability to arrange the &#34;buttons&#34; as I like, this shouldn't be any problem at all, and I don't know why it isn't already a feature, especially since the device remote isn't mimicked at all.<br /><br />The solution is to plan out the permutations of your activities (watch a movie on blue ray, watch a streaming movie, play a video game, watch TV without surround sound, watch tv with surround sound, listen to a cd, listen to streamed music, etc) and set the necessary inputs and controls within a defined activity. Do that and you'll have a blissful entertainment experience. Skip that, and you may just hate using this thing.<br /><br />The included remote (so you don't always have to have your phone with you) is nice and hefty with great tactile feedback, and while you probably couldn't use it for the initial setup of a brand new device, it will suffice for general, everyday, doing things. The one downside is that the remote can only control 6 predefined activities, so if you have more, you will need your phone for those.<br /><br />Overall I am very pleased. Once I worked through the initial setup and created the custom actions sailing has been smooth and I certainly enjoy only one remote, and if it does happen to fall between the couch cushions and I can't find, I can always call it and listen for the ringing."
1158,5,"Good sound, works fine. Radio tuning is ok, no presets. Perfect for listening to CDs. I would recommend it to a friend."
1159,1,Had it 2days and it already went bad. Has a blue spot in corner. Next time just getting one from Sony.
1160,5,This cord streams really well with the adapter from Ipad to LCD TV. Thanks a lot for a great product!
1161,4,"I was pleased at how easy it was to set up this screen.  When I removed it out of the box, I noticed a very strong chemical smell.  I opened a window and aired out the room.  It smelled like plastic.  The fabric on the side of the screen had a few frays and I later noticed a slight rip on the black border.  I was unsure if I caused it or whether it was shipped with a rip.  I used black electrical tape to patch over the black ripped border and sealed the black tape with clear shipping tape.  Aside from that, I'm pleased with this product.  I received the box with one end of the box torn off and I am unsure if it was torn during shipping or when it was placed in the resident mail cage at my condo complex.  No parts were missing when I removed it from the box."
1162,1,I bought these for my sister's beats. She only had these for two days and the stopped working. I sent them a email telling them about my situation but i never got a reply. If i could rate this a 0 out of 5 i would!
1163,5,"First purchased one for my Mom, 86 years old.  The sound is great, but she did have trouble finding the volume on the right ear phone.  Also, bought one for my mother-in-law, 95 years old.  She has an easier time finding the volume control, and since she lives with us, I don't have to hear the program she is watching all over the house.  Instead I love my quiet house, and she enjoys her shows.  And sometimes when we watch the same show together, I don't have to have the TV louder than what's comfortable for me. Through these headphones I love the sound for music and TV shows after everyone else has gone to bed, I don't have to worry that I'm keeping them awake (my daughter also lives with us)."
1164,5,"Tested in water sound,shock For better review Check out this video on YouTube:<br />http://youtu.be/ASHPrwtmbrw<br /><br />Check out this video on YouTube:<br /><br />http://youtu.be/ASHPrwtmbrw"
1165,3,"Not the most secure mount, especially if it's extended fully.  It does function okay for the price, though.  Enough said."
1166,5,Worked as well as the original lamp for my Sony TV. Found a YouTube video to learn how to install it into the casing. Breathed new life into my TV.  :)
1167,5,"It did take a long while for me to get this item. Much longer than it was supposed to take, but I am very satisfied with the product. Thank you."
1168,4,"I bought this kit to build in school since it was required. A lot cheaper on amazon than school store. You do have to put together yourself, soldering skills required. I do use it frequently to test truck accessories."
1169,4,"Help to organize the mass, and keep the room clean. The only reason I give it 4 star is the biggest size is still not enough for thick cords from TV or my coffee machine."
1170,5,You can't go wrong with these earphones. Just get them! You won't be sorry.  Even if you are into high end earphones these are a good backup pair.
1171,5,"I have purchased 4 these now, two were gifts, one is being used by my daughter on a 720p LED TV and the remaining cable is being used in my home theater.<br />The wire itself is just thin enough to be pliable which handy in those tight spots behind A/V equipment.<br />The ends are well made and don't have a &#34;cheap&#34; feel to them.<br />The connectors themselves have always fit tight.<br />I've been running my oldest cable between my blu-ray player and receiver which outputs to a 135&#34; 1080p screen. I've never had an issue with it.<br /><br />Overall, you can't beat these cables for the price."
1172,5,"I have a couple of these to 24&#34; monitors, and the cables are well-made and deliver the expected results.  Highly recommended to keep in a bag."
1173,4,It has very strong construction; quite heavy but well made.  You need a stud finder and two able bodied people to put it in place.
1174,5,"We have two small children in the house, one likes to chew and the other always has sticky hands, neither of which go well with the Apple TV remote.  This case protects it well as there is a layer of plastic over the buttons now.  As a bonus the controller no longer is super slippery therefore it stays on the couch better, versus sliding between cushions.  Please note this is a sleeve, the remove slides in from the very bottom, but fits very snugly so it will not slide out.  Might as well get one of these now instead of both a new Apple Tv remote and one of these later."
1175,1,The converter is very heavy and I would not recommend to hang it on the wall. Even when plugged in on the floor it requires support to remain properly in the socket. Used it once. Poor connection and created burning plastic smell. Needless to say I didn't use it again. Not recommended.
1176,5,"Don't hesitate to buy this speaker, it's awesome!!!  If you've had bad experiences with other crappy 15 watt 50 foot range (supposedly) wireless speakers then this one will deliver with 600 foot range and 80 watts of power it delivers excellent sound..  I have only tested it at about 200 feet and it worked great with no problems and feel I could have went further for sure!<br /><br />Rich"
1177,5,"Wanted this to listen to music in my office and it is perfect for that.  It's small and lightweight enough that I can carry it with me and listen to it at home or in the car or office.<br />They provide you with the mini-usb cable and also a cable to plug non-blue tooth players into it.  The only thing missing is the wall plug for the usb cable, but they can be picked up pretty cheap now."
1178,5,I was  very surprised  by the clear  receptions of both  am/fm !  The  sound is nice and  the bass  enhanced sound<br />  good too !  I got it under 40 bucks !
1179,5,"Something good, this headset for mobile devices, very comfortable wearing headphones, headphones sound quality is very good, classical, pop are good............................."
1180,4,"It is highly unlikely that I will ever purchase flashlight alkaline batteries again.<br /><br />These batteries would be a perfect (5 stars) if the positive side of the battery had a full metal faceplate (Some of my flashlights have a spring that makes contact with the faceplate and not the tip.  My work-around was to place a vey small stainless washer around the tip.).<br /><br />The C/D adapters work.  The spot of STICKEY rubber cement was removed with laquer thinner.  I doubt if I will be buying any more of these because all of my large old generation incandescent flashlights will be replaced with the incredibly brilliant new CREE T6 LED Technology (See NiteCore SRT-6 & 7).<br /><br />What amazed me about the Ni-MH batteries is that the flashlight is brighter using a Ni-MH than an alkaline of the same or greater voltage (less internal resistance???).<br /><br />I charged them using my NiteCore 4-battery charger.  (AA and especially AAA need to be charged in pairs because of their small size. Use positions 1 & 3 or 2 & 4.  No restrictions on the big fat 3400mah Lithium-Ion batteries. Note:  AA & AAA batteries don't fit as securely in the charger as the Li-Ion.  They need to be carefully positioned.  The charger, however, charges all types of batteries properly.)"
1181,5,Most durable pair of headphones I have ever had. They won't break unless you rip them apart. I love them!!!  Great colors & sound.
1182,5,"Great price. Just what I expected. Works wonderful. I had price them from other places and they ran around $20 decided to look up on amazon, just what I was looking for and for a great price."
1183,5,I had not seen headphones that hooked over the ear before. These are certainly very comfortable. I'd buy them again.
1184,5,"I bought this charming clock to put on my dresser so I can keep track of time while getting ready for work. I like that it's made of metal which feels sturdy. And the design has an antique feel which I find quite charming. The size is just big enough for me to see the time from my bed 10 feet away but small enough to fit on my dresser. Just to let you know, I do not use it for the alarm as I use my cell phone for it. It's been a few months and so far the time has been accurate."
1185,3,"Just received and put the unit in, decent fit, power button on top doesn't quite clear the supplied slot and there should be a small opening so you could keep the case closed and plug it in for charging. Having to leave the cover open to plug in seems a waste, but decent case for the money, thin, nice feeling.Magnet for keeping closed would have been nice but we will try it out and see if it does the required job."
1186,3,"The Good:<br />The unit can't get very loud but it can reach reasonable volumes. The sound quality is decent for a device this size. The Aux in feature works nicely for playing music from another device. Lots of options for other media (usb, micro and regular SD.)<br /><br />The Bad:<br />Navigating the menus is a pain, especially the radio (there doesn't seem to be a way to exit the radio once selected other than turning it off then on or plugging something else in.) The radio tuner simply didn't work for me. I couldn't pick up a single station inside my apartment (which is where I had planned to use it.)"
1187,5,Nothing more to say really. Love these cables. And it sure beats the hell out of spending 4 times the amount at Staples for the same cable!
1188,4,is just what I was looking for and it's just like I imagined thanks for sending I am recommending for their good work and providing quality service thanks
1189,5,"I had geek squad come over and mount my TV.  I had previously had HDMI cables that I wanted to use, but they were a little short for what I needed.  Instead of trying to sell me on their $100 cables, they suggested looking for CL3 rated cables.  I am so glad they did.  These cables work as good or better than the cables I had previously.  Before I had the super expensive HMDI cables by monster.  These cables were certified to go through the wall, so don't let anyone setting up your TV tell you otherwise.<br /><br />I can't yet say how long they will last, but by the look of the construction, they should last a long time.  I have had them for a few months now, and have not seen any signs of cables deteriorating or problems with the picture."
1190,1,"These could not fit on my blue tooth. They are a piece of junk. I tried one and it just broke. I don't recommend any one buying them.[[ASIN:B005HKE4VO Bluetooth Headset Fixer > 2 \\""Unbreakable\\"" Ear Hook Replacement]]"
1191,4,"This is a review from a non-audiophile. My listening tastes revolve around internet radio, YouTube, games and a small collection of good quality mp3 audio files.<br /><br />Audio Quality: No complaints here. While it doesn't sounds as &#34;fantastic&#34; Ala wired audiophile headphones, there is no reason to expect that top notch quality from Bluetooth headphones. For wireless Bluetooth, this is respectable quality.<br /><br />Bluetooth quality: Acceptable, but not the best I've seen/heard. There are moments where the Bluetooth connection drops some data, especially more so when the audio played is a very short piece (e.g. a computer beep). I can only guess that this is due to how the internal mechanism/algorithm handles the transmission of data, coupled with available bandwidth and transmission quality/<br /><br />Price: For the price point (Approx. $50), this product delivers more than its weight and should be able to satisfy the tastes of most day-to-day aural activity.<br /><br />Design: The design is also pleasant on the eye and I've received a comment now and then about them being nice.<br /><br />Comfort: Works well, sits well on my fairly large. oval shaped head. The sides are adjustable which should see it fit a large number of head types.<br /><br />Construction: Seems sturdy and should last if you are like me - takes care of electronics and gadgets. However, I do not exxpect this product to stand up to much abuse - the joints are definitely capable of breaking if you toss them about, as is the plastic covering. The glossy finish also does attract a good amount of hairline scratches and fingerprints."
1192,5,Very good reception in attic of 1st floor  villa in Port Charlotte gets signals from Fort Meyers to Tampa area..  I purchased a winegard metrostar omidirectional model MS2000 for $50+  and it was not as good.  Would recommend and buy again in a FLASH
1193,2,worked on a TV form  2000 or 2003  didn't even work on all the old TVs &#34;shouldn't buy it t&#34;.
1194,5,No Sag. Make sure you install it in the middle of the studs in your house. I mounted a 65 inch plasma TV. Before we hung the tv on the mount i had a 135lb guy doing pull ups and hanging off the mount.
1195,4,"Surprisingly great bass.  Disappointing, muffled highs, despite being described as \\""full range\\""; none the less, the bass is pretty darn amazing for bluetooth.  I didn't rate these at 5 stars because they are supposed to be over the ear headphones and they fall quite short of accommodating my adult male ears.  I can't manage to stuff either ear in to either cup.  I don't have elephant ears, but they are larger than average.  After 30 to 60 minutes my ears become quite sore from the pressure exerted by the cuffs.  Despite these shortcomings, I'm going to hang on to these headphones strictly for short periods of listening to songs with great bass.  To be honest I'm doing that at this very moment and enjoying the strong, distinct punch of the bass drums.  In fact, when the small live audience on the recording began to clap, I jumped and looked to see who was behind me.  OK, so they are at least 3.75/5.  I'm revising my previous review (3 stars) and boosting my rating to 4 stars!"
1196,3,"im not convinced these are any better than the 1 dollar version or the 4 dollar selections, but it was prime eligible and i needed for my S9-HD's for holiday flights. got here in time and they fit though i remember my original earbuds and these are not them....they are actually better than what shipped with my s9's.<br />they do seem like they will fall off just as easy when around my neck, shuffling my luggage and laptop carry-on's but thats why i guess they come 8 to a package."
1197,5,"Loud and clear, quite portable and road ready, I particularly like the stereo system with a pair of these speakers."
1198,5,"Bought 4 of these for my home theater setup.. Works great, they are connected to my HDMI switch, Directv box, AppleTV to wall.. and from wall to TV.. Works Great! Thanks Amazon!"
1199,5,"This surge protector is great. I like the colors, not because I actually plug anything in to certain pliugs, but because it makes it easier to see when you are plugging in items while reaching behind cabinets and what not.<br /><br />The size of the strip seems to be slightly larger, which makes for an easier fit with multiple items connected.<br /><br />I have also had some bad power surges in my house and this item has managed to handle them all very well. I even lost my microwave over one, but my TV and game console were just fine after the surge!<br /><br />Monster makes a superior product!<br /><br />Short and Sweet: Buy this to protect your stuff!"
1200,3,"Does the job. Make for very easy access to the remotes, stays in place. It is what it is and is worth it's cost."
1201,4,"This unit performed well, however one of the connections was not made securely and I did have to make a minor repair."
1202,5,"Worked great for putting around a chimney.  Comes with about 10 foot long metal straps.  It can be a bit confusing to set up, jus t know that the metal bands get put thru the bolt heads but first you have to slip onto the metal bands the little metal tabs.  Once one is on, then slip the end of the band thru the eye hole of the bolt, then slip the end back thru the other side of the metal tab.  Once tight, you can crimp it to hold in place.  Then you tighten it down by using the nut end on the bolt after it has been passed thru the framework."
1203,5,"This is a perfect record player for anyone looking for a small, compact record player with a bit of a vintage-kitsch feel. It sounds remarkable & I like the fact that the record is being spun on a rubber turntable (the thing around the spindle) so the records will have less of a chance of being damaged. The only drawback (so far), for some, is the volume/speakers. Personally, I'll be in a dorm soon, so the volume isn't a big deal for me, but if you're looking for something that will blast your jams, this might not be the record player for you (but you can plug in speakers). Overall I feel like it's a great investment & will be used often."
1204,5,I can now use my Vizio with having to get up from what I am doing. It works perfectly. I did not have to modify anything.
1205,5,"easy to install; even on a block wall--all hardware needed is included--fit TV, adjustable in all needed directions---a good value"
1206,1,"I thought they were pretty good until the left side went out today. I will not be repurchasing, since I know in another eight months I'll just have to replace them.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- They are comfortable, I could wear them for a long time without my ears hurting.<br />- The noise cancelling was good. *See &#34;Cons&#34; for additional info on this.<br />- Small enough to carry around in your bag or pocket.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- They do not last long. (Nothing does anymore, it seems)<br />- I could hear some &#34;static&#34;, which was presumably the noise cancelling feature. My previous headphones (a different, over-the-ear brand) did not do this, and they were better at doing the job than these. After awhile I did get used to it, but sometimes it still irritated me."
1207,2,"My sound bar has given me fits from day 1.  Sometimes it worked, sometimes it did not.  I received a flashing light from the bar continuously and couldn't shut it off without cutting the power.  Once the power was restored the bar worked beautifully.  The sound is amazing - I can hear dialog and bombs dropping in a movie without raising or lowering the sound.  Ultimately, after 2 months of flipping the power switch, it stopped resetting itself.<br /><br />Their customer service department at DT is wonderful.  They recognized the problems: 1) my components were all trying to control everything and confusing each other or 2) defective panel.  They are sending me a USB drive with a file update that should help with the communication problems.  If not, they said they would take care of switching out my unit for a replacement one, as they have had problems with the panel and unfortunately this could not be repaired.<br /><br />Ultimately, I love the sound and hope that the repairs will help resolve the problem."
1208,5,works really nice fast shipping friendly service and it even comes with its own level . was easy to put up feels good . its holding a 60&#34; with know problems
1209,3,I sit approx. 5 feet away from the product with my laptop. This drops out frequently if I'm not in the right spot. Sounds good when it works right.
1210,4,"Setup & connection was easy, audio quality is great, but there's a slight video-audio delay when playing movies in VLC. Easily corrected but still keeps it down a star."
1211,5,It comes with everything you need to hook it up. It works just as designed. Im glad i bought this rather than 2 different boxes
1212,2,"I have to take the TV off to adjust the tilt.  Low profile is great, but only if you can pull the tv out a bit so you can plug in a USB or other device without have to pull the tv of the wall (which is the case for me with this mount).  I will upgrade soon."
1213,5,"I love these headphones. I work in an environment where people around me talk allot, which I have no problem but sometimes you just need to put your head down and work."
1214,5,"Great quality, great sound, well built and sturdy.<br /><br />These replace similar headphones of same manufacturers previous model.  The unique improvement is the ear cup swivel flat to accommodate easier storage."
1215,5,Bought this as a gift for a friend so she can watch movies from her computer on her TV.  She and her daughter can now enjoy big screen movies.
1216,2,"This car charger was not made specifically for the Lansinoh pump, it just haopens to fit in the power slot (kind of). I had to hold the charger into the pump the entire time I was pumping otherwise the unit would shut off. Not the ideal situation while driving."
1217,5,"Very easy to install, but if you are using it in an Acoustical ceiling format, I would recommend leaving the ceiling tile in place and then cutting the hole. Really makes the process a lot easier. I purchased 2 pairs of these, and so far they deliver great sound to my home theater. Amazing product!"
1218,5,"I use this to keep my bunny from chewing the cables in the living room.  Because of the complex cord system we have, it took me about an hour to cut various pieces and thread them through but any normal setup would be done in minutes."
1219,1,"DOESN'T WORK!! DON'T BUY!!!<br /><br />I bought this for my dad, hes got a hearing problem. Didn't work! I've tried every way... Everybody at home tried to make it work! Even the dog Tried!!<br /><br />¡Seriously this is junk!"
1220,4,Good basic information to get started with your own service and/or restoration.  Recommended as a supplement to the factory manual.
1221,5,Great device that works really well.  Got it hooked up on to my wireless network within minutes!  Very pleased to have this extensible option although it would have been nicer had the receiver included this capability by default.  Given the price it wasn't painful to include as part of the bundling that I purchased.  Leveraging this for Pandora and other apps built into the receiver was an unexpected pleasure to stumble into and is a wise investment if you intend to extend such capabilities as mentioned.
1222,1,THE HEADSET IS TOO SMALL! EVEN AFTER EXPANSION THIS<br /> DOES NOT FIT BOTH MY KIDS -  AGES 10 & 12??.
1223,3,"Not as good as expected, some they have problem in tightening the speaker cable and therefore contact may not be the best. Most work nevertheless"
1224,5,"For the price, the remote really does the trick. I was able to get rid of the tv, cable box, and speaker bar remotes for this one."
1225,4,i was very satisfied with this product and would recommend it to my friends and family. thanks amazon for your great experience.
1226,2,"Well it is a 6 outlet surge protecting power strip but....its construction and materials are little cheaper than I expected.  The plug outlets are difficult to get a power plug into,  which suggest to me the quality is not good.  The color, which is why I purchased it as it is in a highly visible area works well with the walnut desk."
1227,1,"Good sound and the in line controls are nice, also nice are the varying length cords, but I cannot get them to fit. Perhaps if a second person helped but what a hassle. I've gone back to using my original iPod ear phones which hang in the ears. Not as good sound but no trouble to use."
1228,5,"I love this player. I bought it to listen to pod casts and NPR while i mow the lawn. It works great for both. Also, the price is right."
1229,4,It's great to be able to get HDTV for free!! I have this antenna in the attic and it does an excellent job picking up most stations. I hooked up another antenna along with it to improve the reception of a couple of UHF stations.
1230,5,Arrived next day like promised! Less expensive than the last replacement bulb I purchased. Very easy to install and I'm completely satisfied!!!
1231,5,The cart is being used with a 60&#34; LCD television that is rolled between various buildings in or plant for various customer presentations.  It has handled the bumps in the road as well as moving from office to office.  The larger than average casters are the prime factor for the great mobile performance.
1232,2,"I've only had them a few weeks, and I really wanted to like these earphones, but they're simply not worth the price.  I upgraded from the AH-C560R's, which I *loved*, and while they do have the ability to reproduce a fuller range of sound, I found that I simply did not like how they sounded without equalization.  They seem to be focused more on the midrange than high and low end.  When EQ was added I encountered an immense amount of distortion.  I've also noticed occasional distortion in the right ear even without EQ and at a low/normal volume.<br /><br />The earpads aren't very comfortable either.  I tried all but the smallest size, and none fit well.  The odd egg-shape makes them move around in my ear a lot more than the circular kind, and the air channel is TINY.  (I tried to use some replacements from other headphones, but the connector/sound port is far narrower than any headphone I've owned.)  Just walking around with them made them shift in my ears, which made the amplitude of the music shift as well.  I'd be walking and all of a sudden I could barely hear out of one of the earphones until I repositioned it.  I don't have a ton or earwax or anything, but they clogged up within a few days.  Additionally, the thick cable means you're constantly dealing with the sound of the cord rubbing or bumping against your body.  This makes them awful for commuting in NYC."
1233,3,"I am sure this works, but on my side I used the wrong word to order the part.  I should have ordered a Micro HDMA to VGA Female Video Cable Converter for PC DVD HDTV.  It costs too much to return the product so I'm kind of stuck with a part that I won't use.  Lesson Learned.  Make sure you know what you are getting.  [...] This image might have been helpful before I ordered.  At any rate I have a new cable on the way and I shall just have to wait and see what happens."
1234,5,"On occasion, you come up short.  You meet other guys in the locker room with longer HDMI cables than you, and you cringe.  You tend to believe that your HDMI cable performs better than the others, and the size doesn't matter.  Your A/V equipment seems quite satisfied -- well, except for that cheap Best Buy Insignia Blu-ray player who never fully appreciated what you had to offer.<br /><br />But seriously ...<br /><br />I needed to extend out an HDMI cable by a few extra inches due to a reconfiguration in my A/V closet.  Since the original cable is run through the wall, the easier solution was to tether another cable to the original one.  My original cable was approximately 15 feet, and the new tethered cable was an additional 6 feet.  With over 20 feet of cable, I was concerned with signal degradation.  Here comes the Cable Matters coupler to the rescue!  These sturdy little couplers are build solidly, with nice gold-plated connections.  Each cable fit in securely.  When the moment of truth arrived, and I turned on my equipment, everything came up perfectly.  Absolutely no loss of signal, and the picture is as good as ever!"
1235,5,"I put this antenna up a few weeks ago and have been very pleased with its performance.  Living in SW Ohio, I'm able to receive stations from both Cincinnati (including those located across the river in Northern Kentucky) as well as Dayton for a total of 49 stations.  I have it mounted rooftop, approximately 5 feet above the roof line of a two story house.  It's fixed pointing NW, so that my desired stations fall within it's beam width (though signals are weaker but still reliable for a couple of Dayton stations that lie nearly due north of my location).  I'm using this antenna with a pre-amp ( [[ASIN:B003P92D9Y RCA TVPRAMP1R Outdoor Antenna Preamplifier]] ) to overcome losses from the cable run into and through the house as well as a couple of splitters on those runs.<br /><br />For it's size, it's an excellent performer."
1236,5,"Very easy to install, and light weight.  But best part is its just as good as my roof top antenna."
1237,4,"Cons - took much longer than expected to assemble? The instruction booklet print is too small pictures are not very good, the vertical tilt is not very good - difficult to get tv to stay in a true vertical position.<br />Pros - very sturdy once in place , works well ( except for vertical tilt)"
1238,5,"I purchased this item at a very reasonable price, and hooked it to my Sony DVD, MK808 Google TV and cable box. It has a 3 HDMI out, controlled by a remote control with remote sensor so you can hide the box. I used my learning remote to learn the codes and now I easily go from one source to another. You can power it, but I haven't found a need. Great buy."
1239,2,"The reviews for this product made its purchase seem like a no-brainer.<br />I bought three packs of Sanyo AAA and AA Enelop cells.<br /><br />For some reason I decided to charge the AA cells when I received them.<br />The cool little LCD meters on the BC-700 all showed the cells charged<br />to 1920 - 1895 ma.  Without giving things a second thought I left them<br />charging overnight.  In the morning the cells all read 890 ma.<br /><br />I thought I made a mistake, removed the cells and tried to charge them<br />again.  Nine hours later they had the same current reading.<br /><br />I used a second pack of AA cells and had pretty much the exact same<br />experience.<br /><br />I left a telephone message with La Crosse and received a call back a<br />few days later.  &#34;Terry&#34; speculated that I may have received a bad unit.<br />I will be returning this charger for a replacement later this coming week<br />and will edit/add to this review when I have more to say other than the<br />fact that I am a little disappointed and frustrated:  I had wanted to purchase<br />a battery/cell charger - not a discharger!"
1240,5,"I dont have a ton of words that are required to say about this product, it is a cheap functional HDMI cable that lasts just as long as the rest of them"
1241,3,it was hard to mount tv on the brakets.  they did not explain how it locks on the brakets.  once installed it was pretty good.
1242,4,"I am very rough with my headphones. I've killed two pairs of Grados because I tend to take my headphones everywhere, drop them, and step on them from time to time. After using the PX-100-IIs for over a year, they are still holding up and I am using them while I write this review.<br /><br />Sound: These are not audiophile cans. They are not as euphonic as a pair of Grados. That said, they do sound great, better than most entry-level phones. I am not an audiophile so I won't go into detail on the sound, but there is sufficient bass, defined mids, and distorion-free highs. It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I rather enjoy it. Additionally, because these headphones have an open design, you can hear enough of the sound around you so that if someone calls your name, or if you are walking and a car approaches you, you will be able to easily hear it granted you are not playing music at full volume. Because of this, I wear these at work when I am at my desk in case a coworker needs to get my attention. Because of their open nature, some sound also leaks and at high volumes others will be able to hear what you are hearing, so that is a factor to consider.<br /><br />Design: These are my go-to headphones for when I travel, go to work, or to class when I was a student because they fold up very small and take up little space in a backpack or bag. It does take a second to learn how to fold them up, but after a couple of tries you get the idea.<br /><br />Durability: These things are built like a tank. I've had so many headphones and earphones break on me because I am too rough with them. Not these. I've stepped on these, dropped them while riding my bike, pulled the chord really hard, and they still work as well as the day I bought them. A year and three months after I bought them, I did get one tear in the chord (my fault) as well as tear near the base (again, my fault). A little bit of gorilla glue fixed both tears.<br /><br />Microphone: I have had 5 different mic headphone/earbuds over the last two years. ALL of them have died on me except my PX-100s. The mic quality is very good, I use them for voice and video calls all the time and on numerous occasions the friends I speak with prefer I use the mic on the PX-100 versus other options I have.<br /><br />Comfort: I happen to think I have a large head. Whereas my Grados made me uncomfortable after 15 minutes of wearing them, I can wear these for hours. That is not to say that you might not feel some fatigue wearing them after a while, but that compared to most other headphones, these are very comfortable.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you need a pair of phones that fold up small, sound great, are durable, and let surrounding sounds enter, these phones are just for you. If you need phones that do not leak sound, look elsewhere.<br /><br />Note: I never fluff the stars I give to items. Star inflation on amazon has led me to buy some really crappy products so I am very realistic when I give out stars. I review products for what they are, not what I wish them to be."
1243,1,"I am a heavy user of earphones and have tried several ones before this. I prefer to use headphones at home but earphones at work. Almost always, one of the earbuds stop working within a few months of buying the product and I know its a common problem, but no other pair lasted shorter than this one.<br /><br />This was my first time trying a JBL. It seemed that the JBL 33 had a sturdy build and would last longer than the others. To the contrary, it lasted less than two months. I only use earphones sitting at my desk, so it was all the more surprising that this pair didn't even last two months.<br /><br />Highly disappointed."
1244,4,"I've been using this trunk charger for over a month now and it works pretty much just as I expected. As a matter of fact, I'm considering purchasing more for myself and as gifts because they're convenient and compact (perfect for traveling, especially in the car).<br /><br />When I plug the trunk into a computer USB, it stays put in the exact position I put it in.<br /><br />Now, I do want to add some clarity to a previous review about the trunk being plugged in to a wall charger but I first want to say that I'm using the old style Apple wall charger (you know, the big chunky one) and I have yet to test the new style Apple wall charger.<br />With that said... If I had a complaint it would be with the old style Apple wall charger because it doesn't fit tightly into any wall socket but even with the loose wall charger and the weight I've never experienced my phone falling. I do, however, push the wall charger firmly into the socket anytime I put the phone on the trunk just as a precautionary measure because I notice that when I take the phone off the trunk, the charger comes out of the socket just a bit causing it to be loose.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this product this to anyone."
1245,1,"Buyers beware, this is an out of production product.  According to Niles Audio the ZR-6 receiver was discontinued prior to March 2013 (exact date not available).  Production was discontinued because a critical component is no longer available from the vendor.  Good luck getting it repaired as Niles is out of stock for replacement. I'm now stuck with 6 Keypads and no receiver."
1246,2,"The devil is in the details on this one; notice that it says &#34;ATN3600L Replacement Stylus&#34; not &#34;ATN3600L Stylus.&#34; What I received was not the Audio-Technica branded 3600L stylus, but an aftermarket knockoff that was not built to the same specifications. The tonearm on the specific turntable I was buying it for had a 4.5g weight on the stylus, and the replacement stylus I was sent could only handle 1.5g of weight, which means that the entire cartridge dragged on the top of the record and sounded terrible. I had to send it back at my own cost, which meant that the refund was only about half of what I paid for it. Make sure you're getting the real deal if you've got any question whatsoever about what your tracking weight is."
1247,5,"The sound that emanates from this smallish sleek speaker is beautiful. Music has clarity, definition, and terrific highs/lows for a sound system of this size and price. I hear all these little instrumental and background sounds that I've never heard before. Audiobooks are a totally new experience as well - I can pick up so much more of the narrator's voice.<br /><br />The unit is small, sleek, attractive, and lightweight enough to move from room to room as needed.<br /><br />Minor gripes:<br />- have to take the case off my iPod every time I plug it into the porting dock.<br />- a little weird that they chose not to build the bulky adapter into the back of the dock.<br />- biggest gripe: the remote has limited functionality (besides play/pause, volume, skip forward/backward)<br />- since there are no lights and no LED display on the dock itself, it's a little difficult to see exactly what's going on from a distance ...<br /><br />I've read that the SDII had a lot of issues with the connector, but the lightning pin connector does seem to be pretty sturdy on this model (again, it's annoying to have to remove the iPod case), but I'll update it anything goes kaput in the coming months/years.<br /><br />Bottom line: This sound dock does exactly what I wanted it to, and expected it to: It's stupidly easy to use, and the sound quality is great for the unit's price and size."
1248,5,"I loved how easy it is to set this up! Now everyone in the house can play music from our devices (phones, tablets, etc.) and now we're listening to music all the time. It's great."
1249,4,Really like the cable just wish it was longer but this one will work for now i may have to get a longer one
1250,5,"this product works as advertised, got it on time, I have no problems with this product, buy it it works great"
1251,1,Didn't work at all!!!! Do not waste your money!!!!!
1252,5,this is the second one for second tv very good turning angle for when you move furniture tv still faces you
1253,5,"Look, I'll keep this short. I'll tell you what matters. I'm at the gym 4-7 days a week. Im a male, 145 LBs and sweat a lot. I lift then run for 30-60 mins every session. I used to complain endlessly that my ears are the type that spit heaphones THE SECOND I get sweaty. One obviously needs great jams to work out with. I thought I was doomed to my work outs being constantly interupted and irritated by lose headphones. I decided I would spend any amount of money I needed to in order to find the only pair of headphones that would stay in my ears while I sweat and run hard. Well, THESE ARE THOSE HEADPHONES. They are adjustable and simply DO NOT BUDGE. I run fast and sweat hard, they dont get adjusted once. These have saved my faith in sports headphones. This is the first review I've ever written and only because I feel so passionatly about this product. Great sound, great feel, exactly what a runner/gym rat needs."
1254,1,I returned this item as I had no use for it once it came.  Just a matter of timing.  Seems to be an interesting device but never had to use it.
1255,4,"The only problem is that there's not much adjustment for getting the image to display on the screen exactly. It gets really close, but the edges are cut off so you'll only see part of the windows bar or the X will be cutoff of a maximized window. Not really a big deal for me tho since all I use it for is watching netflix on an old tv. For that purpose, it's great. Do NOT expect any kind of HD quality from this."
1256,5,"The headphone is a bit small and sometimes makes ear a bit uncomfortable, but I like the U Penn symbol on it. The sound is pretty good, too. A little reminder is that this is V8 not V10, perhaps I'll get a V10 or V12 sometime else."
1257,5,Totally waterproof iPod?!?! I was skeptical at first but I am a believer now. I received this product about two months ago and I am in love!
1258,3,"I love a good value, but these adapters are $30 and $40 from OEM; caution buying cheap!<br /><br />I am posting this for information only , , , not as a review!<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Universal HDTV Adapter (5-pin) w/ 5-pin to 11-pin MHL Conversion Tip<br /><br />MHL 2.0 HDTV Smart Adapter"
1259,5,Got these headphones at a cheap price but the quality is off the charts for all the music lovers out there who like cheap and heavy bass.
1260,5,"This is an expensive product, but worth it since it will keep you from ruining the original non water proof ones from Apple.  I've ruined 2 ipod nano's before I got this just from running in humid weather.  Plus this version of the ipod allows for easier changes to advance or rewind the song."
1261,2,"I bought the headphones for my workouts. Price was the only good thing about them. After a few weeks they started falling apart. I tried gluing them together, until one day they fell apart during my workout and zapped my ear, quite painfully. I give an extra start for the bargain price."
1262,5,"Been looking around for a bluetooth speaker for under $100 that is loud enough (this speaker gets very loud) to use outside around the pool but also works as an indoor speaker. Essentially wanted an everywhere speaker. Don't love the way it looks (future lunchbox) but it's a very practical design. Love the handle and rubber. It feels very substantial without being heavy and you'd never need to worry about your kids around it. As with many of these bluetooth speakers, the sound quality is terrific. It seems to occupy the mid-range which I like but does thump pretty well and hits the hi's nicely. I haven't had any problems with the sound dropping out or wavering and play it at a quiet level most of the time while I work."
1263,4,Remote was shipped quickly and exactly as advertised.  I had to look up the directions to program on line but they were not hard to find.
1264,5,Installed on our boat and works fine.  It has a little cover for the auxiliary hole to keep water out.
1265,5,"I purchased this cable (at a very attractive price) to link my Amazon Kindle HD to my HD-TV so I could watch &#34;Under the Dome.&#34; The results were stunning, to say the least. I was extremely pleased with the performance of the cable, the price of the cable and the delivery (almost overnight) of the cable. Three for three isn't too shabby!"
1266,5,"It has an easy to use 2.5 inch multi touch display. It comes with voice over and invert colors for people with disabilities. It has amazing video and music. It comes equipped with Nike+ pedometer. It comes in 7 or 8 colors and a pretty decent price of $149 dollars.<br /><br />This device is portable and simple to use. I've dropped it several times and no dents and cracks. I use it often on trips for movies and music. The fact that you can control the volume the power button and the screen with one hand is really cool to me. The screen is kind of small but it's not that big of a deal.<br /><br />I would recommend it to anyone who likes to listen to music.  Any age can use it even my little 3 year old brother will want to use it. I got this Ipod so I wouldn't take up all the space on my phone with music and it has a good amount of space.<br /><br />It is very similar to the Ipod nano 6 but it has new features that the 6 doesn't have. Like video and FM radio, the Ipod nano 7 is also almost two times bigger than tiny square Ipod nano 6. I love this Ipod it has amazing features awesome colors and only $149."
1267,5,"I live in southwest area of Chicago, 26 miles away from downtown.  I bought this antenna a few years ago and mounted it on the chimney. It received most of the hd tv channels from downtown Chicago.  However, in bad weather, the signals were interrupted from time to time.  A few weeks ago, I did a research, and found that an antenna works much better if it has a reflector.  I have a unused satellite disk, which is mounted on the east side of my house, under the gutter.  I thought the satellite disk would be a great reflector.  With this in mind, I mounted the antenna to the front of the disk. The antenna looks just like sitting on the disk because it fits the size of the disk perfectly well. I pointed the disk to downtown direction.  The result is astonishing. I receive so many more channels than before, totally over 60! I used 3 way splitter to connect it to 3 hd tvs, and the result is still excellent - the signal strength for most channels are still more than 5 bars!  And there is no more interruption even in a stormy weather."
1268,1,This little gem did not pick up any channels whatsoever. I am not an electronics noob and know how to set up everything I own. The antenna just did not pull any signal from the airwaves as advertised.
1269,5,"First of all, I love the box it comes in, very chic and large enough to protect the actual headphones. I love the design of the headphones and they are of great quality!! I love these!"
1270,5,"Was an owner of a basic Sennheiser model a few years back and then switched to Skullcandy which disappointingly turned out to be a bit uncomfortable after long hours of use (though the bass effect of those earphones are still awesome). Was searching for a new headphone which I could afford and yet enjoy some quality music when I stumbled upon this beauty. Affordable and worth every bit..;)..Good bass wuality, compact, stylish and sturdy too.<br /><br />Cons would be the thin wire, thin joint to the plugin and as specified by some previous users, the sound is slightly audible even as I enjoy music..:)"
1271,5,Lots of sound from a little speaker bought two to play in stereo one pink and one blue would recommend buying two to play in stereo!
1272,4,"I have used Verbatim blank disks since I bought my 1st cd burner. With the exception of their Life Series, I have been very happy with their disks.<br />I have not used their LTH series long enough to determine how reliable they are for long-term storage. Before buying you should determine if your burner will handle them - not all do. I found out that what burning software you use can make a difference. I got errors using NTI but tried ImgBurn & no problems."
1273,5,WORKS FINE .LIGHTNING BREAKS THE PICTURE UP. LIKE A RABBIT EAR.BUT YOU CAN DEAL WITH THAT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO MOVE IT ...<br /><br />............
1274,5,i needed a new one it works great i really don't know what to say about its a wall charger
1275,3,this alarm is really loud. The bad is that there is no am or pm so you can't reset it until night time. You have to wait about an hour after the set time to turn it on before it will not ring. The ringing is already acting up after a month. It won't ring steady. rings a little and stops and then rings again. It is good that it does wake my teenage son.
1276,5,"I lost my first Sansa, and could not WAIT to replace it.  I highly recommend this powerful little player to you."
1277,5,I absuotely love how I can hook this up to my macbook and TV and watch and do whatever. I hate that the new macbook pro already comes with a HDMI outlet.
1278,1,i had my ipod and it stopped working. so you sent me a damage ipod... it was a gift for my girlfriend and she was so happy when she got it and now she is disappointed. i can believe you would sell something like that!!!!
1279,3,"When I first got this cable, the quality seemed great and I still think it's good, but the coil has started to come permanently uncoiled so it doesn't retract all nice a neat like it first did. Still fits great in iPhone 4 or 5 with case on and plays music just fine. #firstworldproblems"
1280,5,We saw your Wireless Model S speaker in white on Fab.com and fell in LOVE.  Actually bought one directly from their website.  The sound is amazing for such a small box and it looks super sleek.  I definitely recommend it.
1281,5,If you want a itouch for a camera get the 5. Ive already brought it with me to a different country. And taken tons of pictures with it.About 562 pictures were taken. Get the Ios7 toooooo.
1282,2,This item's mounting holes don't align down the center of the stud. There are two sets of holes that may be too wide for the stud in the wall.
1283,4,"Not sure whether it was the set or bulb, but it only lasted 11 days before failing.  I was very pleased with price and timely delivery, just not the failure of TV.  I have since gotten rid of TV with replacement planned for later this year.  I will search amazon in the future for replacement parts, etc. when needed for other household things."
1284,5,Works like a champ.
1285,4,"This is a great converter for video sources do not change the display format or resolution.<br />Not so good for HD TV set top boxes, which can change resolution and/or format frequently, even within same program, movie or commercial. When the video format or resolution changes, there will be a delay with blank screen while the HDMI handshake occurs fir each video format or resolution change."
1286,4,I am with other reviewers..clock is great but screen is too bright at night even on lowest dimmer...ceiling projection is great and very adjustable
1287,5,"I thought about getting the more expensive set of a well known brand.  After getting these to try, I am hooked on them!!  No need to pay twice as much...."
1288,2,"Bottom line, the bulb blew after a few weeks of use and caused other issues with the projector that required us to send it back to the manufacturer for repair.  The projector was under warrantee however they claimed the cause was the non-OEM bulb."
1289,1,This was a no good purchase because that item is pre-owned.  Have music and pictures is the memory card. Im buy for a gift and mi girlfriend say my cel is old!!!!
1290,5,"These headphones are the best one (from the perspective of a proper fit) that I have ever owned (and I've owner more than a few).  I would highly recommend them to anyone needing headphones that fit properly.  Maybe my inner ears are sheped funny or something, but I have several sets that just won;t stay in my ears.  Bummer.  These work like a champ."
1291,3,"The OSD VMS300 volume controls were too deep for our wall box and felt very cheap. I originally wanted these to replace our 19 year old Russound knob volume controls because I preferred the look of the more modern slider bar and our old volume controls had become discolored. They look much better in the photo, the slider is a cheap dull plastic and does not glide smoothly. I ultimately purchased the newer Russound ALTx-2D volume controls and am much happier. At the time of my purchase both items were selling for $30 a piece so cost was not a factor."
1292,5,My HDMI cable was too short and I was constantly switching from my console to my laptop. So I bought this so I didn't have to switch all the time. The cable is nice and long so I can keep my laptop on my desk instead of the floor when I plug it in.
1293,5,I bought an elliptical through craigs list and it did not have a plug in.  Thank you for this adapter. It works great!
1294,1,"I thought the higher price of this unit would mean better sound.  Not the case, I returned it after listening to it."
1295,5,"These NiMH cells are great!  They're exactly the size I needed to replace the bad, worn out NiCd cells in my power pack for my automotive refrigerant tester (equivalent of the Tif ZX-1 tester).  Commercial replacement packs run about $60-80 but I was able to replace these cells in my pack at a cost of about $20. The restored battery pack works great and lasts longer than the old NiCd one even when it was new (due to the higher capacity of NiMH over NiCd)."
1296,1,The sound quality is not as good as I had hoped.  Possibly because only the left side functions... straight out of the box! So I'm not 100% sure about the sound quality.  But they fit great and feel very good.  My ipod earphones sound better.  I have several different headphones.  Klipsch are my favorite in ear headphones.  Audio Technica are my favorite over ear headphones. I was only looking for a decent sounding in ear sport headphone to work or workout with.  I can only give these one star because there is no excuse for these headphones making it to the shelf with only one side functioning.
1297,4,"This isn't too powerful or anything, but it's also not too expensive. I bought a similar product from a different company and it came to my house totally broken, so it's nice to see that this one works as intended just fine. It seems to be incorrect about the actual charge of a battery a little too often, but I don't have the heart to give it less than 4 stars."
1298,4,I bought a few of these because the local stores charge so much for them.  I use them on the PS 3 and a blue ray player and so far no issues.  The construction seems pretty solld
1299,1,Did not pick up a single channel in this area.  Located close to several channels and not one showed up.  Would not recommend this item to anyone.  Shipping cost to return item more than it is worth.
1300,3,"This brand is great, however the one time i ordered from Amazon a majority of the DVD had markings on them.<br />They still work fine but it could just been from  a bad production run."
1301,5,works great just as described hasn't let me down let I have had it for a few months nothing negative to say about the product
1302,4,"Reasonably sturdy as it arrived intact in a collapsed carton which was poorly packed or simply inadequate.  It's rated for many more miles than I need (I needed 6 miles), so it works great even just leaning up against the wall aimed at the ground. I will mount it permanently after I move to my new house."
1303,1,Not at all worth the money spent.! Please do not buy this product.<br />It's not user friendly and it took me forever to connect it to the Bluetooth device. Finally ended up returning it.
1304,5,"I bought this to convert to HDMI for my Blackmagic Cinema Camera.  Works perfectly!  Don't bother with the more expensive BM version.  Though it is also a great product, it will be more than you need or should pay for.  Just be sure that the external monitor that you use is compatible with the camera... my first one was not and I thought it was this device.  Turned out it was the monitor that wasn't compatible."
1305,4,Used it on vacation and performed very well for background music around the house.  Build quality seems very good.  Worked as described.
1306,3,I haven't receive them yet so i can't make a review of them. I hope they will be as good as they show it.
1307,5,"I needed a long audio patch cable to run from my laptop projector in my back yard to my stereo in the living room so we can pipe the sound for our movie nights to our patio speakers outdoors.  I also want to do the same thing in my RV so we can have outdoor movie nights when we camp out in the desert.  When I started shopping for a cable I was hoping I could find one cheap enough so I could keep one in the RV and one in the house, because it would be a drag to run off and forget the cable and not be able to hook up the sound.<br /><br />This cable is a great quality and an amazing price.  It needs to be sturdy enough that it can make the long run outdoors and not break if/when someone steps on it.<br /><br />I'm very happy with the quality and the price was low enough that I bought two.  Yay Amazon!!!"
1308,5,I use this cable to hook my wireless headphone transmitter to my Ipad.  I can listen to Audibles audio books anywhere in my home.
1309,3,bought this for my sister but her landlord didn't allow her to mount this on the wall so can't give an opinion.
1310,5,"08/17/13 - Update from earlier review. My brother loves his speaker, as I expected<br />he would.<br /><br />Bought one of these to use with my iPod 5, and it's such a good speaker<br />I bought one for my brother to use with his tablet. Fabulous sound,<br />just the fight size to take just about everywhere. Pairs easily,<br />can't imagine what I'd do to improve it."
1311,5,"It works very good it is just like my other one, a little bit smaller,<br />but that's okay  it gets the job done.<br />I might order another one , when my the bigger one stops working.<br />thank you<br />Liz miller"
1312,4,"Easy to set up, heavy base which ensures stability, about three feet off the ground perfect height for most tv setups."
1313,5,"My wife watches TV late at night to fall asleep...separate bedrooms was not an option :-).  I plugged this thing in and it works like a champ - great sound and despite what someone else wrote, the range is great and surprising to me, it is not directional.  It covers the room great and does not require direct line of sight as I thought.  The ear buds that come with this set are very comfortable and small enough to fit in my wife's small ears.  I recommend this to any couple with a late night TV watcher.  The charging station and integrated IR transmitter is also a nice compact and sleek unit.  No complaints!"
1314,5,"Was looking for a great pair of headphones that would stay in my ears while exercising.  So far they have yet to pop out, so I am very pleased!"
1315,5,"To those who have any health issues this could be a life saver.<br /><br />I use a one tsp twice a day and the vitamin C is 90%+ more absorbable.<br /><br />To anyone concerned about vitamin C levels, please look into how to make it."
1316,5,on time perfect it works good with my power chair i love it the product is amazing it is portable thank you
1317,4,This speaker links almost instantly to whatever device I want to connect it to and the sound is great. Couldn't be easier and it was at a great price too.
1318,3,"I was considering an upgrade from a smaller Mitsubishi 73\\"" DLP TV to this larger 92\\"" size.  It is a shame that Mitsubishi stopped this excellent product line at end of 2012 and got out of the DLP TV business.  The price of the remaining stock is getting higher everyday and too expensive now.  I am considering getting a large 120\\"" fixed projector screen and a good projector instead. The combination appears much cheaper and provides better picture quality, except for suffering from ambient lighting."
1319,2,I bought the 160 GB to store most of my music collection. But I am finding it very difficult to select a particular song. The wheel keeps skipping letters. Very disappointed.
1320,5,Hooked this up to a GLI pro turntable and can't believe how great the sound is for the price.  I am not an audiophile but I can't imagine spending more dollars will make much more of a difference in sound quality.
1321,1,"I spent hours reading reviews, I had a budget of less than $100 and just wanted a decent earbuds that I could use for biking. I previously had a pair of Klipsh S4 earbuds that had great sound quality, but continuously fell out with light exercise. I had high hopes with all the positive reviews that these would perform and the  low price ($20) seemed too good to be true.<br /><br />I really cannot think of one good thing to say about these earbuds, the biggest issue for me was the continuous white noise. I tried listening to a book on tape and with every pause there is an annoying white noise. I thought maybe it was the book or the device, but I tried other headphones and there was no white noise with others. The sound quality for me is also poor, I am by no means an audiophile, but can tell the sound is subpar, it is like a tinny sound, makes music seem like it has little depth.<br /><br />Other issues were the headphones didn't stay put, maybe I just have ears that buds don't fit well in, but these were among the worst I have tried. The last issue is the wire on the headphones is extremely thin, it hasn't broken on me yet, but is noticeably thinner than I have had in the past.<br /><br />Overall I would rate these maybe a step up from a pair of free earbuds you might get with a device purchase, but I'd be hard pressed to recommend purchasing them."
1322,5,Outstanding value!  Works better than expected!  Quality build sturdy fiber inside. Not much more to say at this point. Will buy more.
1323,5,haven't tried them out yet since I have some old tapes to use up but I have no reason to believe that they won't be great!
1324,5,I purchased this over a year and a half ago and I love the deep quality sound!  Works great and even has a rechargeable battery so you can easily take it from room to room without an annoying cord to move  and find an outlet for.  It is a little long in size but the quality of sound definitely makes up for it.  I'm getting another one for downstairs !!
1325,5,The sound is solid and strong base for the size.  The solar recharge and ability to charge other devices is exactly what I wanted in an outdoor portable speaker system.  Taking it by the pool and beach.  Great for outdoor excursions and a carabiner clip to secure to a backpack and you're rocking the whole trail.
1326,5,Easy to install and the mount is strong for a 46' tv<br />It just has too many small pieces !
1327,5,Works as advertised<br /><br />I've had no problems with BlueRigger. I'm an AV and Tech vendor for corporate events and conventions.
1328,5,My iPhone case doesn't allow most cables of this type to connect because there is some part of the connector that gets hung up on the case. This cable can go right into the iPhone headphone jack and the sound quality has been great.
1329,4,"Nice sound and fairly comfortable for very affordable earplugs, would buy them again.cord and plug and cushions work well , bass is ok too."
1330,1,Ordered this optical cable based on the picture provided.  In the pic the cable looks like its decent quality with thick cable.  I assure you it is not a thick cable.  Flimsy as hell.  Amazon should make them take this down as it is false advertising.  Do not order this.  You will be disappointed like the rest of us.
1331,2,it was my own fault. I cannot use it on my radio. it was not defective at all. The fault was all mine.
1332,5,i love it it works fine no heat over nothing fully charge 100%..... work on my dell n4010 if i buy a charger it would be from this seller
1333,5,These worked for me and my family on our recent trip to Europe. No problems with them. Good deal for the price.
1334,5,This adapter is well constructed and works just fine. I used it to adapt a single subwoofer cable from an amp to the dual imputs of a subwoofer. Everything fits well and I have had no problems.
1335,5,"While I love this tool, which I use several times a day to avoid listening to commercials and loud noise on TV, when I sent for a second one I rec'd one with a distorted face of Pres Obama with a slash mark across his face.  The seller and I emailed a couple of times -- he pleased that the anti-Obama product is selling so well and me pleased that I could remove the sticker.  I was so offended by that picture."
1336,3,The real range is about 100 feet when there are no walls in the way. The sound quality is good but the headphones are a little heavy which can be uncomfortable after a few hours.
1337,1,This product did nothing to help me with my head cleaning problem.  It did not work on my VCR at all.
1338,4,"Shelf works perfectly to house our cable and DVD.  Glass allows the remote to still operate, but protects it from dust and small children."
1339,5,I use this Outlet Power Cord Extender to separate main power supply from Dusk/Dawn lights to a waterfall arrangement that<br />I use RC-012-1-TR-009 Heavy Duty Wireless Remote Control on.
1340,5,"Like the double box that I purchaed, really nice for holding my DVD's and CD's  Wish they came in colors!  Great value."
1341,5,"I think the bottom line with HDTV antennas is your distance from the TV transmission towers.  If you are in the forest somewhere or maybe in a dense city, you may need to get an outdoor mounted antenna or an indoor powered antenna.<br />If you are close, say 10-20 miles, this little gem fits the bill great!  Small, easy to place, easy to install and the cost is cheap.<br />Don't believe people who rate this product poorly, most likely they are just located to far from the transmission towers and need to step up their HDTV antenna to a higher performance unit.<br />For me, about 52 channels and after deleting a few redundant or ethnic ones I now have about 40 clear channels to watch for free!"
1342,5,I purchased it for my mother's Dell 5000. Turns out it works great!<br /><br />It saved us a small fortune. Thank you.
1343,4,I bought this item to patch the LCD TV to the Home Theatre/DVD Player. It looks to be better quality than the HDMI cords that come stock. Works as expected and sure it will outlast the tv or the reciever.
1344,5,I bought this as a present for my girlfriend and she loved it. The product looks as seen in the picture and sounds great. Recomended it if you are a Hello Kitty fan :)
1345,5,"connected a satelite reciever to another tv a long way away,  works great, you can buy splitters and even add more  one TV on HDMI one on component, yep there is a differance but not much"
1346,5,the remote works great and is a must if you want to had your receiver from view. the price is hard to beat compared to anywhere else.
1347,4,"I use this speaker for playing computer audio/music around the house and occasionally broadcasting bird recordings in the field when I am birding.<br /><br />For its size, this speaker produces good quality sound and has solid top volume level. In the lower frequencies mine is a little fuzzy, but the fact that a speaker this size can even play the lower frequencies is impressive. It is certainly a huge upgrade from the built-in speakers on my MacBook!<br /><br />Bluetooth pairing is a synch and requires no effort at all. I have used the JAM only with my iPod Touch and MacBook so far. I do wish the wireless range was better. Even with no obstructions, 30 ft is the maximum range, and at anywhere upwards of 20 ft mine cuts out or gets crackly now and again.<br /><br />I do wish the JAM held a charge a bit longer, for the days when I am in the field all day with no way to charge it. Even when used with the line-in instead of Bluetooth, the battery typically only lasts for a few hours. I find myself frequently switching the power switch to &#34;off&#34; throughout the day when I'm not using the speaker to try to save battery, but it's very easy to forget to do this.<br /><br />Like others, I wish the charging cable was about a foot longer, but this is a small issue that can be overcome with minimal creativity. I do think it's great that the charging cable is a USB - very small and easy to pack and then use with your Apple charger or plug into a computer.<br /><br />Overall a good product for the price."
1348,5,"This subwoofer was great. Adds great bass when watching movies, etc. The speaker itself is rather large, so I ended up placing it in the basement surround set-up because it didn't fit the wife's living room dimensions.<br />Delivered timely and in great condition."
1349,2,This product worked the first time just like I thought it should but every use after that the battery died faster and faster. The size was good and it was super easy to add music too. Now days a battery on a mp3 player needs to last longer then this one did. I replaced it with a ipod touch and am getting the battery life I need.
1350,1,Save your money and time do not buy theses cables.  They did not work to comment a hdmi from my laptop to dvi input on my monitor.  I tried on two separate machines.  I returned the cable and lost shipping costs and ended up buy another brand which worked perfectly.
1351,5,my husband wanted these for his birthday / fathers day and he loves them its perfect for a sport fanatic! best of gifts
1352,1,It kept on popping off sockets. The fit was loose and it was difficult to charge devices especially on the plane.
1353,5,"Unfortunately, these &#34;High power&#34; units are all going away... ;-(  Jamo's is the only one out there yet, and probably not for long, that can handle the high-power that an audiophile puts out. (hundreds of watts). If you have a rinky-dink system in a box from Costco..., you don't need this, and won't know why. But if you run Carver, Mark Levenson, or anything like that..., then you know what this can do for you."
1354,5,"My only gripe is when you want to use them with the D adapters they don't last as long, but that is why the manufacture used D's in the first place not AA.  Use these for everything in my house."
1355,5,"I'm totally impressed with this kit.  The microfiber cloth is huge, as is the bottle of fluid.  The best part is that it works really well without fear of damaging delicate and expensive electronics.  The kit also works great on eyeglasses and TV screens.  The fluid will last a long time and the cloth is totally worth the price of the kit.<br /><br />Yay!"
1356,5,It was a great product for the price.  It was used to let kids watch a portable dvd player.  Saved the day!
1357,5,"As the title of this product suggests I purchased this ceiling mount for a Epson 8350. The fit was perfect and the installation was about as straightforward as could be. All of the needed hardware was included, including special spring-loaded T fasteners number used to attach the base plate to the ceiling.  Although I installed this myself, it would have been is easier with a buddy. I also wanted to let everybody know about the great customer service that I got when contacting the guys at &#34; projector ceiling mounts direct&#34;.  I contacted them regarding exchanging the plate for a different projector (ended up purchasing a Ben Q instead) and they were great sports about it, offering to exchange plate-for-plate without any additional cost. I will definitely keep them in mind when making purchases in the future."
1358,5,This product did what I needed it to do perfectly.  I would recommend this item to anyone installing a TV on the wall.  They were plenty long from my jack to the TV inputs
1359,5,"As soon as I hooked this up, I about fell over from the superior quality of the sound. And it's super easy to set up. I bought these for my husband who is very hard of hearing. He can hear well with these. No more screaming tv and I'm a happy camper, too!"
1360,5,"I was blown away by how great this speaker sounds how loud it gets and the overall design and function of it. I read many reviews here and on the web before making this purchase, glad I did. Best product in this category by far."
1361,4,Materrials are relatively thin around the zipper dog got ahold of it and ate through it. Otherwise holds a ton of movies i might get another one. its worth the price.
1362,5,"This is a good replacement or backup charger. I would recommend this. I hope I don't have to, but if I did, I would buy this again."
1363,5,"Exactly what it says. Does the job just as good as any $50 Monster cable would do, is a Nice product...."
1364,4,Very durable and has pretty good sound for the price! I actually have 2 now because I bought my son one.
1365,5,"I got these for my 2 year old grandson who is afraid of loud noises and I was afraid he would need them on his first airplane flight.  He was so intrigued with the flight, he did not need them but they are cute and look well made.  I will keep them around."
1366,5,"I had originally ordered the medium regular density, but they didn't fit as well as the mediums that came with my Phillips SHS8100 earphones so the sound quality suffered. The seller recommended I try these and I am glad I did! They feel a little stiffer/more sturdy than the originals and appear to be of very good quality. They fit on the headphones very snugly (TIP: flip the outside edges up to have easier access to the little sleeve that fits on the earphones). The sound quality is just as good, if not better, than the originals, and I don't have any outside noise interrupting my listening experience. Great product that I look forward to using for a long time."
1367,5,I paid $40 for this beauty when it was on sale. It works great! Don;t let the small size fool you. I have used it in a big room with a dozen folks talking and the music was loud enough with very little distortion. (I use it with my Iphone). Not sure it it's worth the extra cost at its regular price of nealry $60. I also use it when I watch movies on my Ipad as the sound is so much better (and louder) than the Ipad's built-in speaker.
1368,5,I had previously purchased the Nyrius SW100 Optical audio splitter / selector and could not get it to work. I tried shorter cables (with the thought that maybe the connection was being lost because of distance). Still nothing.<br /><br />THIS product works PERFECTLY (with longer optical cables too)! This device is much smaller than I had expected and the remote makes being lazy even easier. This product comes HIGHLY recommended. Don't waste your time and money on any of the cheaper manual switchers.
1369,5,Have withstood numerous charges w/o and noticeable loss of power. These are the second set purchased for travel trailer weather news radio. Best at holding charge w/o discharge I have used.
1370,4,"Just got this in the mail and started playing with it a few minutes ago. I've tried (and returned) several sets of bluetooth headphones in the past, and so far, this one addresses my primary complaint -- audio quality!<br /><br />I have a Samsung Note 2, which supports the aptX audio codec. At the risk of sounding like an ad for aptX, the difference between it and \\""regular\\"" bluetooth audio is night and day.  Before buying this product, make sure your phone supports this, or you'll get regular old bluetooth quality, which sucks.<br /><br />I haven't used these long enough to comment on battery life yet. I'll update this review if I have any problems (really hoping battery life is decent).<br /><br />Update:<br />I'm dropping a to 4-stars for very low range, at least on my Samsung Note II, which is currently the newest generation smartphone. I pretty much have to have my phone in my front pocket for music to play without cutting out - in my back pockets gets me intermittent short cut-outs in audio. This isn't a deal-killer by any means, and 95% of the time this is how I would use the phone anyway.<br /><br />To be fair, it's possible that this is an issues with Samsung's implementation of Bluetooth, but another reviewer mentioned the same thing, so it's probably the headphones."
1371,2,"These had the exact shape (behind the head) and ear piece (flat, not a bud) I have been looking for.  Unfortunately, when I received, only one side worked. I returned.  Didn't order another one because I figured there must be very little quality control."
1372,5,"I purchased one of these on that other site, but I just had to review it.<br /><br />I currently have this single tower paired up with a set of Energy RC bookshelf speakers.  All connected to a Yamaha 400 series receiver.  I must say, there is absolutely no better speaker within this price range and you will be hard pressed to find anything that can match the sound quality even if you look at speakers costing twice this price.  Energy simply makes outstanding speakers.  The fit and finish is elegant and perfect.  The sound stage is amazing, you might need a small sub to fill in the low end bass but I personally do not believe that it is completely necessary as this tower does a find job at punching out some solid bass.  The mid range and highs are crisp and detailed yet retain a nice warmth.  I can listed to these for hours on end and never get tired of what I am hearing.<br /><br />If you are thinking about it, then just buy it."
1373,1,"I do not live very far from major TV stations, nor I am blocked from mountain or tall buildings, I can barely get signals from few stations. A metal coat hanger might pick up more chanel."
1374,5,"Love the speakers, they sound great and love the look. They fit perfectly in my space. Price was great as well, highly recommend!!"
1375,4,Fit nicely in ear only down side would be that you cant turn up the volume or awnser your mobile phone.
1376,5,The product is portable and comes with 4 AA 2800mA batteries. Adapter is included in the package for travellers plus it is 110-240V compatible so no need to worry plugging it in to any supplies. Charging and the batteries are safe with its 260mA rate though you will need to wait several hours to complete the charge cycle. I've been using this to my toys and other gadgets. Highly recommended product for your toys and electronics gadgets. Simple product yet giving outstanding function and performance.
1377,1,"If you are looking for a good extension cable, look elsewhere! If you are looking for a makeshift rope, you are in the right place! Right out of the box, I plugged it in and was very disappointed. Sound is really bad. Crackles, pops, and cutting in and out are usual with this cable. It is very quiet, but when you turn it up to a comfortable volume, it only worsens the crackling and popping of this low grade product. I hate that products like this are able to be sold! It's like they used aluminum foil with plastic on the outside! I cannot understand music I know by heart! It's just white noise coming out of the cable! I checked to see if it was my headphones, nope! After I eliminated this rope, it was perfect again! If you pull it out to the right spot, it is not as bad, but still pretty unbearable. I returned it the day it came. Look elsewhere, and avoid this crappy product from this con artist seller!"
1378,5,It was like brand new it was excellent condition.it was a bargain price.i never regret it I wish I can buy more at the same price.
1379,5,"These headphones feel very comfortable, and they fit snugly around the ears.  They are not noise cancelling but they do a very good job of keeping out extraneous noise.  I like to listen to my music now on the iphone, whereas before I found it difficult to do so because of the ambient noise.  They are very basic style, so people who are looking for colorful or super attractive headphones should look elsewhere.  But for me these are just great."
1380,5,"Next best thing to bring to the pool or beach. I love it!!!! Awesome sound, well worth the money love love love it !!!!!!!!!"
1381,5,"The uniques design of this product allows for the flexibility to pull in good signals, from various stations, without a power source."
1382,2,"Although the picture was the same as my &#34;old&#34; battery, the replacement was different and didn't fit. I would measure carefully before you order this product."
1383,4,"Sent to my wife she's really happy with this system! Great sound, she turn it on when i was on the phone and i could hear how clear it sounded. I'm in Kuwait and it was good to hear how pleased she was with it!!"
1384,5,"I didn't expect too much from these from what I paid, but I love them.  They sound pretty dang good outside, and they seem to be able to handle a decent amount of power.  I'm actually thinking about getting a second pair for use inside."
1385,1,I've had to buy these over and over for the past couple of years since they peter out after approx 30 - 40 hours of use.
1386,5,"I have no complaints.  Price was great product seems like it's good quality and very sturdy.  I'm hanging a 22&#34; LED UN22F5000.<br /><br />Out of the box, this thing was so stiff I could have used a crow bar.  A little WD-40 and it works great; bolts are tightened to just the right torque (I did not adjust them).<br /><br />Hanging: the bottom nut blocked the ability to mount to the wall.  Maybe i could have worked around it, but it was easier to just take it off and mount it.  I had no issues with the screws they provided.  I used the 7/32 drill bit first like they recommended in the instructions and then used a socket wrench to put the bolt head screws in.<br /><br />TV hangs fine. There is 0 sag in the whole fixture.<br /><br />Recap: Great price. They should include a mini can of WD40, but if you don't already own a can, you should probably buy one anyway.  Follow the instructions, hang on the wall, enjoy."
1387,5,"Very contemporary, sounds great, and look nice....wished it could support IPad mini.  It didn't advertise that it could so that's why I gave it 5 stars."
1388,5,"This record cleaning tool is by far a must have for anyone buying used vinyl. I would highly recommend that if you dont own one , you need to get it fast. Used vinyl is in most cases extremely dusty you cannot clean it properly without removing the debris properly all your going to do with the liquid cleaners is embed the dust and debris deeper into the grooves, its really cool watching how well this tool works, one turn around the disc and your clean, even discs that i pulled out and thought were clean i would use this tool and was amazed at how much dirt that i didnt see was coming off. This is not a cure all though i still recommend using a liquid cleaner after getting the dust off MOFI is the best. To sum it up you wouldnt shampoo your rugs without vacuuming first, the sticky roller grabs all the dust leaving your disc ready to be cleaned...100 stars for this product"
1389,1,"Ordered this 2 months ago, but, just now installed it, and it does NOT work. Poor quality! Now I'm stuck with it because I waited Too long to return to amazon. So, if you do order this cable, make sure you test it immediately to make sure it works."
1390,5,"I love the way these phone work, very very good. The lights on the phones needs to blink off and on the way it use to do. or a button that make it do so."
1391,4,"Very good sound quality for less than $100.  The display is incredibly bright and it did take me a while to figure out how to utilize the dimmer.  And the alarm is somewhat difficult to program as well.  In fact, I use the alarm on my iPhone which is much easier to set.  That said, I purchased this product for the iPhone docking station and the sound quality and with that in mind it has met my expectations."
1392,1,"This product is terribly made and falsely marketed.  i used it on a 52\\"" TV weighing far less than the 110 lbs stated load capacity, and the tv came crashing down to the floor after 18 mos.  everything screwed into the wall remained undamaged, but the attachments to the TV completely failed. i know have to have my hardwood floors repaired, buy a new tv and have an electrician run new HDMI cables to my AV rack.  what a joke."
1393,5,"If you want an easy to navigate touch screen this isnt for you, it uses the wheel method, cycling through menus.  The Bluetooth headphones are the true value, and the fact it pairs easily with any bluetooth speaker, my wife uses it for runs and then with a bluetooth speaker in the house.  It has a great quality feel to it, heavy, solid. This is a great value in my opinion! We have had no issues, and it has even been dropped a couple times.  The sound is amazing."
1394,5,"This is a simple, cost-effective device, that does the job as advertised at a great price.  Go ahead and buy it."
1395,5,Verbatum unlike some other brands has kept its quality up. I dont get frisbies that are not my fault wish I could afford the dual layer.
1396,5,"Excellent sound!!  Plays music well, sound is good, and it is very loud!  Easy to set up.  Exactly as described."
1397,5,These are the best head phones. All other head phones are uncomfortable and fall out too easily. These stay in place and are comfortable.
1398,4,"Best Price Travel adapter I have found. Plastic does feel on the cheap side. I bought 4, and have only used them on 1 trip but they worked very well."
1399,5,"I was so excited to receive my ipad speaker dock from iHome.  It works very well, great sound, love that I can use it as a charger too. Fits my iPhone too.  Product shipped very quickly too."
1400,5,"am a buyer from China, my English is poor review on this product the first time, do not know what to write, but I really like this product."
1401,5,My cd player has optical out and my reveiver has coaxial in specifically for cd player via the remote. This device allows me to utilize the functoonlity of my recever and it's remote.
1402,5,Loved this. Easy to hook up. Love the buttons being in front with an easy push. It's not overwhelming and does the job just right.
1403,5,"After reviewing the comments from others, I decided that this unit was exactly what I needed for a tricky installation on 24&#34; centered studs. The unit was easy to install.  However, the 2 sets of bolts included for attaching the unit to the rear of the TV were either much too short or much too long.  Other than this minor inconvenience, the product is a solid 5."
1404,3,"The rolls of Velcro style tape I ordered arrived safely and promptly.  However, I ordered them incorrectly thinking that they were the self-adhesive type.  I have returned them and will be getting a refund."
1405,1,"Have ordered these a few time and the quality varies greatly. This deivery was a thinner material, more flimsy and brittle. About 20 of the cases were boken within the case and some cracked just trying, gingerly, to open the cases.This batch is so brittle, almost with a &#34;dried out&#34; feel that I don't know if they're going to hold up. Not very happy and can no longer reccommend."
1406,5,"For the price, good value.  The speakers sound very good and the subwoofer is powered, which makes all the difference."
1407,3,"I bought these to replace the pads on my Grado PS500. The original pads I found to be really stiff and hard on my ears. I like the way these new pads feel but there is one problem I can't get over. These pads absolutely smell. I mean this literally. These things stink so much I can barely stand to wear them. I don't know if its a matter of the manufacturer or possibly where they were stored, but I can hardly think of a reason why these should stink so bad. Even my head smells bad after using them. The smell stays with me after use and so I have to deal with this wafting stench throughout the day. I give it at least three stars at the moment since they are more comfortable but I tend to go for my other headphones at the moment until I can figure out how to rid these things of their awful stench."
1408,5,"We bought these to replace the old Bose noise canceling headphones that, after 3+ years started to fall apart (the fabric/foam), and weren't working quite as well.  My husband travels on planes and these shut out almost all the noise so he can read or just watch something on his computer!  Great sound quality along with the noise canceling feature.  We bought the blue limited edition only because price was the same."
1409,5,"We took these adaptors to our house in Ireland. Absolutely nothing but praise.<br />The adaptor worked well, regardless of whether we had a 2-prong or 3-prong US style plug on our equipment.<br />Nice quality, well built, and unlike some competitve models, these were CE certified for Europe.<br />Also, these were relatively inexpensive, which is nice as they tend to be taken by guests who used them with their computers, and forget to remove the adaptor from the plug when leaving."
1410,3,"I bought this product as a quick fix. Its okay.  If you are looking for quality, this product may not be what you wnat."
1411,5,"I bought this to mount a 19&#34; Phillips tv on the wall, was easy to install and just what I needed."
1412,5,"They fit my Sony Bluetooth headset ... all I wanted. There are three pairs in the package, so I doubt I will ever have to purchase them again."
1413,1,"Despite the misleading \\""by Apple\\"" in the product listing it is not an Apple product, but made to work with Apple iPhones and I use the term \\""work\\"" quite loosely as the one I received did NOT work.  I hooked up my 4S iPhone to charge it and came back later to discover it not only hadn't charged...it had lost power.  I tried to connect it to my computer and it failed to recognize my phone and connect it.  I spent a nearly an hour trying to configure it thinking my iPhone was going out.  Finally I thought, \\""Why not try the Apple cord that came with my iPhone?\\"" I rounded it up and sure enough, the computer recognized my iPhone, synched, and it began to power back up.  Clearly not all Dock Connectors are equal and this, quite honestly is either an inferior piece of crap or I got a defective item.  Either way, I'll be more cautious in what I purchase or use, and while I sound like an Apple Cult member or Sheeople, I'm not going to be fooled again!"
1414,5,Bought for my wife...she uses it when she exercises.  It is convienently small and easy to use so she loves it.
1415,4,I saw all the good reviews for this cable and decided to give a try.  Worked great and have no issues.  No need to spend alot of money on hdmi cables.
1416,3,"First it took forever to recieve, the person didnt even ship it till like 4 days, second the actuall product isnt half bad, its good for like a month or two, but if you want the best quality go for microsoft!<br />your welcome!"
1417,5,"It works, it's 8 ft long, it's white and it provides a beautiful HD stream.  So... what else do you want to know?  Should you buy it?  Uh.. yes."
1418,5,"Bought this for my father for Christmas. Something he's needed for quite a while lol. Love that it has two, one for my mother too.  Now only for him to remember where he put it. I tried it out before hand and it worked very well thank you amazon"
1419,5,Got this to connect an Arrow antenna to a VX-5R.  This adapter does the job and was shipped promptly.  Seems to be of sound mechanical quality. I would recommend this.
1420,5,"I was looking for some headphones at an inexpensive price, but with good quality. Through experience, I learned that that combination was not possible, until I purchased this product. In overall, the sound and build quality is amazing and I do not regret this purchase."
1421,4,"My first set of these were defective out of the box, unfortunately at that point Amazon had sold out of them and I wasn't inclined to return them and have to seek something else out.  I worked through Klipsch support, they verified that I had purchased them from Amazon and got back to me within 24 hours on a Service Order code.  I shipped them out and received a new pair a week later.  I had a pair of Shure E2C's previous to these and I find the quality and comfort better.  It's also comforting to know that if support is required Klipsch is relatively responsive.  I only give them 4 stars for my first pair being defective out of the box, but things are bound to happen."
1422,5,If you like apple then you will love this! The siri feature is fun to play with. The speakers for a hand held music devise sound good (nothing compared to head fones i mean but for a small hand held devise they are good) and the screen is crystal clear. All around awsome product!
1423,4,"I'll be comparing these to [[ASIN:B008EQ1YQ6 Beats Studio Over-Ear Headphone (Blue)]]. I've tried tons of other headphones and nothing beat the Beats Studio's until these Yamaha's! They are heavier than the beats but only a little. The color of the metallic blue is awesome and the photos on amazon doesn't do them justice. The ear cups are slightly larger than the beats also and really fit over your entire ear much better than the beats do (at least they do for me). I don't have huge ears but mine do fit inside the ear cups whereas on the Beats don't and after an hour the Beats hurt my ears from the pressure of their tight fit. I'm being a bit critical on a few things in this review so please know that some of my negatives for others may be no big deal.<br /><br />I took off one star because i feel that the beats are still more comfortable even though they too hurt after awhile. The yamaha's push against you just under your ear lobe against your upper jaw/neck.  After a while it became a bit uncomfortable. Other reviewers also complained about this fit, i think its just the design of them as they have a very circular shape to them. They may loosen up in time and use so we'll see.<br /><br />The sound definitely is more robust all around especially in the lows and bass. I had tested the Yamaha's and the Beats using the same songs and while the Beats were super close, I still could hear crisper/deeper bass and mid's that were just a bit lower in the Beats. Don't get me wrong, the beats were super close, i'm being very critical with the test.  The sound canceling on the beats is a bit better but its probably because they need a battery whereas the Yamaha's don't need a battery. The sound from the Yamaha's in my opinion overall is much more pleasing then my favorite Beats that I love so much. I also have the 50 Cent headphones [[ASIN:B006D8QOCQ STREET by 50 Cent Wired Over-Ear Headphones - Blue by SMS Audio]] and ranking them i'd say that the Yamaha is #1, Beats are #2 and 50 Cent are #3 in terms of sound. (when comparing those 3 headphones together)<br /><br />The box comes with 3 adapters, one is the cable for iPhone, iPad, iPod and the other is for regular use and also there's a 1/4 (mini to quarter inch) jack. On the yamaha's, you have the option of having the plug on either the L or R sides of the ear cups. You also get a nice case that the headphones fold up into along with a microfiber cloth. The case has a nice little fabric handle on the back side making carrying easier as well as a clip.<br /><br />The price is a bit high coming in at $399. (at time of review) The beats are $299 and the 50 Cent are only $125. So depending on your budget you have options. In my opinion its between the Yamaha's and the Beats as the 50 Cents really didn't get close enough sound wise to compare them with the others. For me, i'd rather have better sound but wish the yamaha's were a bit more comfortable so for some the Beats may be better for most people both in price and comfort. But i'm really being critical about things.nd 50 Cent are #3 in terms of sound.

1424,5,These Ear Buds with Memory Wire really do stay in place.  And they come with a few sets of 'in ear' pieces in different sizes to fit most anyone's ears.  The clip is very handy for keeping the cord close to the body so that it doesn't hang up on work out equipment.  They also stay put when jogging. I consider them a great value for the price and have bought two pairs for my family so far.
1425,5,Very sturdy and easy to mount tv can be shifted right and left. Can view tv from all parts of room.
1426,5,"Needed to be able to charge on the run.  We frequently travel, and often use the laptop in the car with a hotspot.  This is a great way to extend battery life and ensure that we can run on battery when in a local 'hotspot'.  Love it."
1427,3,"I have a network cable tester than has BNC tester ports, but no coaxial F test ports. This adapts BNC to F and allows me to test coaxial cables. They seem cheaply made, but that's okay, function here is way more important than cosmetics."
1428,4,Does what i need. Wish the charger didn't take up so much room on power strip. A better design would be to build the charger taller and not as wide.
1429,1,"When I first received the clock it was missing one of the small rubber feet and I had to use tape on the battery cover.  i returned it with no problem, thanks to Amazon, because I didn't want the wobbling due to the missing piece.  The replacement came and the lights didn't work at all.  Needless to say I returned it and just requested a refund instead of a replacement. I never used it, and have no idea how well it functions."
1430,1,NO BEWARE! I just discovered the one I bought was a knockoff. I went to Monster Inc website and did a serial number search only to find out it was a knockoff
1431,5,Great product that is very well made and great price.  I bought a few to keep my old VHS tapes and CDs. I store them in a closed cabinet.  You assemble them which is very easy.
1432,5,"I suppose if you need floppy disks, these work great. We have several old computer operated machines that have floppy drives. So happy I can still find them."
1433,3,"The charger and batteries work well, but the batteries don't last long, so you have to recharge them often. The price is right though so I don't regret buying it."
1434,5,We use both in and outdoors.  My husband and I agree that this is some of the best money we have spent for outdoor entertainment! Great sound quality!
1435,5,Delivered as expected. Great speakers!  My family loves it. Only drawback. I wish the unit turns on as i turn the TV on
1436,4,I was greeted Monday (4/3/13) morning with the package and adapter cables.  The HS120 had actually arrived the week before but i was off.  Delivery was very fast (i think it was one day from order to delivery)<br /><br />My goal was to provide a signal to my projector and monitor from my DVI-D port on the docking station.  I needed to be able to use my monitor (DVI-D connection) all the time and occasionally use my projector (HDMI).<br /><br />The only problem I have is when the screen shuts down it takes a while for the monitor to come back on.  Sometimes i have to cycle the monitor before the screen finally gets turned on.  I have not called support on this yet.
1437,3,The cable is well made and seems to be durable.  Worked well with my HDTV.  Would not hesitate to buy another cable from this company if the need arrises.
1438,5,Works a little too well.  I have to pry him off it regularly.  Much more durable than the one I bought for my daughter years ago.
1439,5,Replaced an outdated system.  This system was easy to set up and the sound is so much better.  On screen tweeking of sound for different media.  We love it.
1440,5,Great little charger. No issues at all. Use it all the time to charge up batteries for everything around the house.
1441,5,"I was looking for a cable that would connect our Android MP3 (Samsung Galaxy) or Apple iPad Mini to my Bose Acoustic Wave System.  I wanted the cable to be long enough to stretch accross the room so I could have my device beside me, and not have to get up if I wanted to change something.  I checked many local merchants, and found that they all carried 3 and 6 foot length cables.  Since I wanted something longer, I ultimately decided on this 25 ft cable from Mediabridge.    I purchased this cable on Amazon from Mediabridge Products, LLC, and have been very pleased.  The cable came in a sealed box (not plastic bag) in perfect condition.  The box and label were both clean and pristine.  The label provided a product description, SKU, Part #, QTY, website, and UPC Symbol.  Clearly the box has nothing to do with the quality of the product inside, but the presentation gave me a positive feeling that I had purchased something really good.  When I opened the box I was equally pleased with the product.  The RCA jacks are very heavy, the cable is nice quality, and the 3.5 mm end has a plastic cap to keep it clean when not in use.  I wanted a good quality cable that would last and not need to be replaced soon because the wires break, or the ends fail, etc.  This cable has a good feel, and is easy to wind up when not in use.  The quality is nice, and I don't ever expect to replace it.  The only thing I struggled with was when I installed it, the RCA jacks were tight going on.  Since I don't plan on taking them off, it is a non-issue for me, and I like knowing that they are secure in place.  The sound quality has been superb, and I am very pleased with this product!  The only negative I can say is that the box says Made in China.  Originally when I made this purchase, I was undecided between this cable and another brands 50 ft cable with a lifetime warranty, but I must say I have absolutely no regrets with my decision.    Additionally, there was a small pamphlet inside the box which tells a little about Mediabridge.  Their cabling and connectivity products have been used since 1998 under various brand names sold directly to commercial broadband providers.  In 2008, they began offering their products directly to consumers.  They have made some promises to the consumers which include:  1. Not selling products through retailers that add huge markups  2. When you call during business hours, an American based representative will take your phone call  3. They will never outsource customer service or technical support to any foreign country  4. To treat customers, employees, and business partners with respect and dignity    Mediabridge is located in Cherry Hill, NJ and can be found at [...]"
1442,3,Honestly the sound is great but I have to admit that after a while these things really hurt my ears. It's because the padding although soft at first begins to make my ears ache so after about an hour of wearing them I need to take a break for a while so not to good for watching movies. Other than that fantastic sound for the price! 4 stars for sound quality but 3 stars because of the lack of comfort!
1443,4,"worked well with my 42 inch Proscan, which was on the heavy side and it was still able to hold it."
1444,5,Item arrived in time and was packaged satisfactorily.<br />Upon opening the package the contents was fully<br />compliant with advertising.  When connected to<br />equipment works flawlessly as promised.
1445,5,A brilliantly simple idea and implementation that works perfectly. I do wish I had bought one before my kids put a iPhone charger plug through the screen of my first LCD TV.
1446,3,"Very cheaply made, my son says they hurt his ears if left on to long. Also the plug doesnt fit if you have a hard case on your ipod"
1447,4,You have to purchase a adapter for this and all hdmi adapters for phones. I bought one and it works perfect.
1448,3,For the price this product is fine.  My issue with it is - it's too big for my head so it moves when I workout.<br />So if you've got a small or average size head and you're going to be moving around you may want to try something else!
1449,4,"I bought 2 of these. I had already purchased 1 Link Depot 6ft HDMI cable over a year and a half ago from elsewhere, so I trusted the  brand.<br /><br />I'm slightly disappointed this time, however.<br /><br />My 1st Link Depot HDMI cable connects my PS3 to my Sony Bravia HDTV. With this set up, I can use my TV remote to access the Bravia &#34;Sync&#34; menu, which allows me to turn on and control my PS3 with the TV remote (a great set up for Netflix.)<br /><br />The 2 new HDMI cables do not allow this function to work. The A/V quality is fine, but they don't seem to transmit the data that says &#34;Here I am, an HDMI device!&#34;<br /><br />I use them for my monitors, anyway."
1450,4,"The Ergo-Fit Inner Ear Earbud fits nicely in your ear, are easily identifiable for left and right ear and the sound is good and clear."
1451,5,"Lately I got hooked on the local HD radio offerings in my area. Unfortunately it seems<br />HD radio has passed it's zenith and units that can receive HD are hard to find. So I<br />felt lucky when this &#34;Boombox&#34; showed on Amazon.com. I bought a used unit, but<br />one would never know. Only a few signs of use but mechanically it works great."
1452,4,I like the small size and the great sound and ease of use. The black seems not to stand out.
1453,5,This Sony universal remote has large buttons and simple design. It is perfect for daily use without too many features.
1454,5,"Although I only needed the 24-pin motherboard connector, I gladly paid just a tad bit extra for a complete new set that arrived on time as expected."
1455,5,Great sound for the price i paid for the product. I also liked the bass system it has. It was better than i expected it to be.
1456,4,"I am unable to receive weather reports on any of the 7 weather channels.  This not the main reason I ordered the radio, but it was a nhice extra.  Too bad it doesn't work."
1457,5,"I originally ordered an Amazon basics HDMI cable for my 32&#34; TV in the bedroom, it seemed to work okay at first but occasionally the sound would not come on when the TV was turned on. I'd have to unplug and then replug in the cable to get it to work. I tried to use an alternate HDMI port in case the TV was the issue but it didn't solve the problem. I ordered this cable and plugged it in and it's been working flawlessly ever since. I can't say for sure that the cable was the problem but the issue hasn't occurred since. Sorry Amazon for suggesting that your brand of cable may be the problem but it could have just been one bad cable (every product line will be bound to have a defective unit or two). Anyway, I was impressed with the shielding and insulation on this cable, the overall look of the cable, and the fact that the issue I was having went away. It seems to be a really good HDMI cable and was at a really good price as well."
1458,5,"These had a very nice sound to them!  I want two more! Very sturdy made , they actually look like rocks."
1459,5,"I have been using one of these for 5+ years with a mix of older and newer (2000-2010), domestic and foreign devices (Hitachi, LG, Pioneer, Samsung, World Wide Video, Comcast/Motorola). Whatever I throw at this remote it can handle. Buttons are nice and big and logically arranged. Very pleased with it's range of supported devices yet it's buttons are not overly complex."
1460,5,This player is real nice and smaller than an ipod. The Micro sd card reader is a big plus whereas the ipod or any ithing has no memory expandability. The only thing that I didn't like was the firmware. It worked for about a few months then I decides to put some OGG files on it... Then things took a turn. Beware the the firmware is kind of screwy when you put OGG files on it. Might do it to other formats as well. Um it tends to delete everything and kills your sd card if you don't eject it quick enough.. :( It will say Refreshing your media and nothing else. If it says that for more than I'd say 40 seconds take your card out! I had a hell of a time with it. It doesn't like different formats or tags thrown at it if you stick with mp3 files then I think your safe but the best solution I found was to flash Rockbox on it ( Google it or go here [...] ) since Sandisk hasn't updated there firmware in a while. Idk why they just don't come with Rockbox on it in the first place Sandisk should ditch their software for this. :) With Rockbox on it this little device out does an ipod and does it for under the price of one. Well plus 14-25 bucks if you add a 32gb sd card with it but still it cost far less then an ipod and does more what you want it to. Oh and ditch the ear buds or give them to someone you hate. If your on a budget get these they sound and feel great Panasonic RPHJE120A for 6 bucks you can't beat them or the best is the Klipsch S4 I got them for 22 bucks on Black Friday or Jlabs are good and rugged but kind of treble happy. The device itself is rugged enough for me some say the usb port is kind of weak. Idk about that but If you want to make it stronger then take it apart and put some JB weld on the port (not in it) just around it just a small bit of JB weld would do it and put it back together again but if you do this you won't be able to take it apart JB weld its one of the toughest glues I know of. But if you are the kind of person thats not too ruff on stuff then I wouldn't worry about the port. I would have gave it three stars with Sandisks firmware on it and over 5 for it with Rockbox on it but since now I have Rockbox on it I've had zero problems and its real fast because Rockbox scans the tags as you're playing the files and none of this waiting or freezing on Refreshing your media. It does what you want with out the BS with Rockbox on it. Plus with Rockbox you get a TON of customizations and you can play Doom. :p Its EZ to flash Rockbox on it anyone I'm sure can do it.
1461,5,I'm shooting video with the Nikon HDSLR cameras and the Small HD monitors on location.  The cables I use have to be reliable.  I've used 4 different brands of cables and this is the best and most durable so far.
1462,5,"Worked,Good quality, great price, delivered faster then expected Not often I need one of these but I have the company saved, good product"
1463,4,"So far, so good. It has been a joy to listen to music while swimming. I swim 2-3 days per week and this has helped a lot.<br /><br />Some quick tips:<br />Just be prepared to use your first swim as a test for both the ear plugs and the alignment of the shuffle. It takes some practice to get both set up, but don't get frustrated. You'll get there. I have found that the best way to ensure the ear plugs stay in is to have as little cord as possible free. That means the cords are held under the goggle straps, with only enough give so that I can turn my head (helps with breathing you know). If you don't keep the cords under the goggle strap and you're doing some speed intervals, the drag from the water can be enough to pull on the cord and pull out the ear plug. But once I got it set up right, I can do as much speed work as I want without losing an ear piece.<br /><br />For attaching the shuffle to the goggles, I've been successful just using the standard clamp and aligning the shuffle along the side of my head. So far it hasn't left any marks on my head, at least no more than the goggle straps already do. I have had it come off the straps once, but that was because I had tried wrapping the extra cord length into the clamp. Turns out that it is just too much to have the goggle straps and cords in there. So the cords get wrapped under the goggle strap while the shuffle is clamped there. Has worked great.<br /><br />Several reviewers have said their shuffle lasts for several months and then dies. If I can get to mid-summer with this without it giving out, I'll bump it up to 5 stars. Also, the only hick-up is that the buttons are a little stiff. But that is well explained by the seller and you can fix that up easily."
1464,4,"This item was recieved in a timely manner and was easy to program.  Only problem with the unit is the (I assume) Antenna and unless those keying the mike are pretty near, they cannot be heard."
1465,3,"Worked well with the Euro plug, but the UK not so much. The only way to get it to work was to only plug it in 2/3 of the way, and if it moved slightly it would stop working."
1466,5,exactly what I needed. Just enough room for my 8 flash cards. Fast shipment too. Thanks for the great service.
1467,4,Not what i thought it was . I was hoping 2 get this 2 connect my pc 2 the thunder bolt display nope does not work ;(
1468,1,"This product has been discontinued and for good reason.  Note that it is still in stock and I urge you to look at another brand.  These headphones have several flaws which I will list below.  In summary, It is a low quality item, very uncomfortable, with average sound quality.<br /><br />Firstly, I rarely submit reviews on Amazon.  But due to the electrical short which developed on this product after only 7 1/2 months (causing static when one's head moves), I felt that I owed this review to other Amazon customers.  It was a good deal going in but if a customer can only expect to get less than a year out of them, then the math does not add up.<br /><br />Secondly, I am not an overly large man.  But these headphones cannot be comfortable for anyone but a small woman or a child.  They have very small ear pads and become uncomfortable after only about 15 minutes.  They apply a lot of pressure to one's head and I have to think they they would not be a good fit for anyone.  I fell asleep with them on and when I got up to use the facilities, my ears were red in the lavatory mirror.<br /><br />Lastly, I am a frequent flyer and I need a pair of headphones which reduce the jet noise on 4+ hour flights.  The noise reduction worked - but at a high cost to music fidelity.  I am not a serious audiophile.  However, I tested these headphones against my son's Bose QuietComfort 3 headphones and perceived a 25%+ loss in the music that was being delivered by the A-T headphones.  Sure, it is an unfair comparison of $60 headphones vs $300 headphones, but be prepared for the difference if you choose the A-T.<br /><br />If you are considering this product, I encourage you to keep looking at other brands."
1469,5,Got it to replace another switcher and it works great. Unfortunately the problem was with the Dish System and not the switcher unit. Automatically switches to another channel if signal is lost on the first channel.
1470,5,"Not much to say, its a splitter and works like one. One great feature I will say is that cables \\""snap\\"" into place and it holds tight. Great splitter!"
1471,5,"Haven't checked all of them yet, but they arrived in sealed packaging, and 4 of the 12 have performed quite well so far (used in two different 2-cell tac-style LED flashlights, rated over 200 lumens on high setting).  No difference noticed yet between these and better known brands."
1472,1,"Plays like a third party or second hand toy. Don't bother, save your money. Your better of with the Audio Technica AT-LP60 Fully Automatic Belt Driven Turntable. Much better for the price."
1473,5,"I confess that it makes me just a tad nervous to have 15 devices plugged into anything - but the Tripp has excellent build quality and I've had no issues whatsoever. Mounts with convenient clips. Price is about right - not cheap, but not expensive - and again, you want something handling over a dozen electrical devices to be well manufactured. Very pleased with purchase."
1474,3,"When I bought this online it seemed bigger. When I got it I was amazed at how small it actually was. However I loved that it could hold any size memory card. Its not as easy to maneuver but you have to get use to it. On the upside its lightweight, great for workout and clips on to anything really good."
1475,5,"Cable is solid weight but not too stiff.  Gold connectors.  Plugged the display port side into my MBAir 11&#34; many many times and nothing seems to be amiss.  With that said, I am relatively delicate when plugging things into this laptop, but still, after 10 months, not a flicker on the screen.  All is good."
1476,5,"This is a very high quality wire for a reasonable price. I upgraded my wiring for 7 speakers with this wire, and there was a slight improvement in sound when switching from inferior 18 gauge wire doing long runs. Overall, I'm quite happy with this product, and I will be using it again the next speak installation I do."
1477,5,"Bought this unit on sale after my old Sony receiver quit on me. This model is a couple of years old now, but it still offers top quality sound, runs all my home entertainment gear through it. The interface on my monitor is basic, not very polished, but once the unit is set up I hardly ever see it."
1478,4,I got this bluetooth speaker for my son who likes to listen to music in the shower.  He likes it very much. Fast shipping and a good company that responds quickly to customer inquiries.
1479,1,I got the cable and it worked great. I was happy up until it stopped working. It would not transfer bass sound at all and then stopped working altogether. Do not buy this.
1480,5,Works great for working out or if you just need a speaker anywhere around the house.  Connects easily to bluetooth.  Very good sound but temper your expectations based on the size.  Great deal for the price.
1481,5,I am a busy mom to college kids and take care of an elderly parent and was getting lost with bills. This looks nice on my desk and reminds me I still have bills left to pay. My only disappointment is the lack of dates by the slots.
1482,5,"Very good, the team is assembled in China, I have not updated your system to the latest version, it seems everything is ok, I like it!"
1483,4,"The quality of these headphones is very good. The only issue I have with them, and most headphones, is that I wish the cord was a foot or so longer."
1484,5,This cord works great and so easy just plug it in and your good to go. The price was also great.
1485,5,"Very sturdy, good quality cable, with a good-looking cable end. Works really well, for a very reasonable price. Nothing to complain about so far (have used it for two weeks)."
1486,3,"Well worth their money, but it's definitely thin paper and the flap on the back doesn't really keep the envelope closed well."
1487,5,I love it! Works perfect just like the one that came with the printer. I highly recommend it to anyone:)
1488,5,"This HMDI cable is exactly what I wanted and it was delivered very quickly. No surprises, no problems. If I need another, I con't hesitate to buy this again."
1489,5,I bought this headset for my ipad 2.<br />The headset delivers good sound with nice quality.<br />The microphone works well.<br />I recommend this headset.
1490,5,"I am using this wall mount to hold a 23\\"" Asus computer monitor.  Right out of the box I was very impressed by the quality of the mount.  The articulating arms are thick aluminum castings and the pivot points are cone shaped which is a great design for a hinge that needs to be locked in place or move with some resistance.  The monitor mount fit the threaded holes in the Asus monitor holes perfectly as per the standard,  The screws that hold the X brace to the arm were a tad loose and needed to be tightened.  The wall mount was attached to a 1/2\\"" sheet rock wall using 9/16\\"" toggle bolts (I didn't use the plastic anchors that come with it, as I was afraid they would pull loose from the sheet rock.)  The toggle bolts are just a dollar or two at Depot/Lowes and give the piece of mind that the whole unit won't come crashing down if the kids pull on it.  The mount also came with a small bubble level which came in handy when marking the holes on the wall.  I extended the arm out to the side flush to the wall and set the bubble level on it to ensure the arm was horizontal and the screen would sit level.  Worked great!<br /><br />After attaching the monitor I noticed that the arm was binding when the knobs were tightened to be snug but not lock the pivot points.  So I took it apart and put a dab of grease on each cone hinge and reassembled.  Now when the knobs are just snug, the arm moves smoothly with a nice amount of resistance.  When the knobs are tightened more, the hinges will lock in place.  I even put some grease on the tilt hinge to make it move smooth.  I was hesitant because I was afraid the screen would tend to fall forward and not lock in place, but that did not happen.  The tilt knob is tight, and the screen can be tilted forward and back and it holds it position.  The power cord and video cable were attached to the arm with tie wraps for a nice neat look.<br /><br />Even though I give it 5 stars, I have these criticisms:<br /><br />- It came with anchors, but toggle bolts would have been better.<br />- The 4 screws you can see in the picture of the X bracket were not fully tight. I had to disassemble it all after installing to tighten them because the screen rocked side to side a bit.<br />- Had to disassemble it all again to add grease so it would move smoothly and not bind.<br /><br />Other than that, it works as it should.  It is solid and does not wobble or sag.  It is made heavy duty enough to handle home use.  The toggle bolts hold it solid to the sheetrock.  Would have preferred to screw it into a stud, but I had no choice as there was no stud within a few inches of where I wanted to mount this.<br /><br />All in all, it gets a thumbs up.  And for the price, you can't really go wrong.ggle bolts would have been better.<br />- The 4 screws you can see in the picture of the X bracket were not fully tight.

1491,5,"great picture and sound.....cant beat the price, so how could u go wrong??.....I have one from my xbox to tv and one from my laptop to tv"
1492,5,"Ordered the beats  fro my daughter for her birthday and less then one week in the dog gets the audio cable. My daughter took full responsiblity on that, which I was shocked. Thank good I was able to find the replacement cable for these."
1493,3,"Was easy to install and worked great.  But I am torn on how to rate it:  It only lasted 7 months, we do watch a lot of TV.  But it costs a third of the bulb from Sony."
1494,4,This antenna was fairly easy to put together and install. I just pointed it in the general direction I was supposed to and it works great.
1495,5,Wife uses them on all our trips. Comfortable for long term use. Cuts out outside noise really well. No problems yet.
1496,5,"I just listened to a pair of these at Vanns today, and I fell in love with them.  Great sound field, sounded great off axis and the highs were so crisp and detailed, I can't believe they don't have more ratings here.  I compared them side-by-side to a pair of Energy speakers that were about $20 more, the Energy's were a little louder but had a color to the sound that didn't seem as realistic as the Boston Acoustics.  I'm putting a system together for my parent's home theater and these Boston Acoustics are on the short list to include in the package.  The would serve great as rear or surround speakers.<br /><br />UPDATE: That's it, I ordered 4 of these from our local home theater store, Vanns, gotta support the locals when you can, especially when they're going for the same price as on Amazon.  I ordered the matching center channel as well, the Boston Acoustics Classic II CS225C.  I called Boston Acoustics (that's right, they have a phone number right on their website next to every speaker that you can call right up) to confirm some misleading information on the HSi 250 posted here on Amazon, and he recommended the A 225C if possible for matching with these surrounds, it looks like the 5.25\\"" woofers are of a higher quality.  I ordered site to store though so I still have the option of upgrading the center channel before final purchase.  The install won't be happening for a month yet but I can't wait to see what the folks think, this will be the first real home theater stereo system they've ever owned.  I'm planning on pairing it all with the Yamaha RX-V673 receiver, which I use in my own home."
1497,4,"This product works well for the amount of money spent.<br /><br />Cons: I needed to use duct tape to get the cords to stay  wrapped around the small spindles in the back and also added a strip to the bottom of the tray to keep the phones from slipping out. Also, there is no way I would trust the small side tray to hold up my iPad, I laid it down on the counter next to the charging station.<br /><br />Pros: With a little work to set it up it does work well to organize cords and that's all I was hoping for, and it looks a lot better than the power strip I was using.<br /><br />Overall, I would say it was worth the money, just don't expect a very high quality item, it only costs $40 and that's what you should expect, otherwise shell out $100 or more..."
1498,3,I thought it was a digital fm radio but it wasn't - my fault. AM reception is not good. FM reception is good.
1499,5,"As usual the apple's products are well done and usefull ! I love the interface, the craftmanship, the look, the app's, everything about this device it's well done, no regrets if you buy it !"
1500,3,"I like the product...mostly, but the lens are extremely loose and the width of the frames is too wide, and I've always thought I have an abnormally big head. The sound quality is good, but even at full-blast, the outside world intrudes horribly.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Inexpensive<br />- Good sound<br />- Plenty of storage<br />- Easy to use<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- Poorly made<br />- Feel very fragile<br />- Overly wide/poor fit<br />- Not loud enough<br /><br />I've had them a couple weeks. I would definitely pay more for a better made product."
1501,4,Very good deal for two of these batteries. Received the batteries in time promised. I would recommend these batteries to others.
1502,5,"I have an older Sony DVR.  I really like all the features it has, but recently been having trouble with new 16x DVD-Rs (error message:  dirty disc).  These 4x worked great.  Plus, easy to write on with felt tip pen.  Very satisfied."
1503,3,Just after a few days the wires became exposed in places very cheap material had a feeling it would happen when I opened the package oh well you get what you pay for pretty much
1504,5,"I couldn't be happier. I gave up my android smartphone but still wanted a media player to take to the gym. I found this device and was very pleased to see it was just like my smartphone without the phone. It's a smart media player. After downloading an app I can even make calls over wifi. I have wifi just about everywhere I go, too. I love the look and feel of the Galaxy Player. It is a sleek little device with a very clear screen. The icons and the font are a comfortable size. It works incredibly well. It looks exactly like a Samsung smartphone so virtually everyone thinks it's a phone and with the app, well, it essentially is a phone without the cost. Giving up my smartphone will save me well over $800 this year. With this device I can easily:<br />Text (with a free downloaded app, I use Google Voice)<br />Make calls (free downloaded app, Google Voice and Spare Phone)<br />Read my books on Kindle or Kobo app<br />Play games<br />Listen to music and create my own playlists<br />Take pictures<br />Take videos<br />Edit pictures<br />Facebook<br />Use it as a remote for the Roku<br />Access the web<br />Read and/ or listen to my Bible (download YouVersion app)<br />Use my Starbucks app to pay<br />and on and on and on. Basically,anything my phone could do, this Galaxy Player can do. And, I just love the look and feel of it. And no monthly fees!"
1505,5,"I got this alarm b/c I've been wearing earplugs to bed and was afraid I wouldn't hear the alarm. Plus, I find loud noises in the morning somewhat unsettling. The vibrations are perfect - it's impossible to sleep through them.<br /><br />Also - I was concerned when I got this that I wouldn't be able to adjust the volume. For the record, you can adjust it, and frankly, I don't really need the alarm part at all - the vibrations work perfectly."
1506,5,"I was skeptical when I bought this, but gave it a try.  I plugged in my VCR, plugged the audio and video cables from my VCR into the Red, White, and Yellow connectors on the capture device, and plugged the capture device into the USB port on my PC.  Installed the software, opened the PDF instructions which I read for all of a minute, and viola!  I was recording my home movies onto the hard drive!  Works great, and the software lets you edit, cut, splice, etc.  I did plug it into my son's new high speed gaming PC because I was worried about lag.  Other reviews said it was laggy and choppy.  Might be a slow PC with not much memory?  Anyway, I would recommend it.  I usually don't buy unless I see about 4.5 stars and hundreds of reviews.  I'm glad I did in this case."
1507,4,"This is a good solution for a user who wants to connect a computer, a DVD player, or other peripherals that require an HDMI female to a television monitor that only has one HDMI input."
1508,3,"Stays on while I run. Cool. Hurts my ears when they've been in too long. Not Cool. Maybe I have ear holes too small. I think they were less expensive than other brands when I bought them. I tried to save a buck.<br /><br />If you think you have big ear holes, go with em. If not, maybe try something else... I know I will"
1509,5,Excellent price for the length.  Looks to be very solid cable.  Will be using it to make a run from a cabinet to the TV through the ceiling.
1510,3,"I like the many functions, Inexpensive AA batteries, 110 V plug-in option and overall looks. My only complaints would be rather weak signal strengths and the sound quality is only fair."
1511,5,"I do not have cable so all of my television comes from the internet: Hulu and Amazon.  Periodically there have been internet outages, and I could not watch TV on a large screen.  I don't have Hulu prime, but I do have Amazon Prime, so Amazon video plays on my cellphone.<br /><br /> I have a Galaxy s3 phone.<br /><br /> I was able to watch Amazon videos just fine with my cell phone connected to the TV.  Sound and video comes through the television."
1512,5,"I bought this for the aux input in my wife's minivan. It works as advertised, and it was a great price."
1513,5,"You can spend less or you can spend more, is up to you. The AKG Q 701 show you what's in there nothing more nothing less, unlike the lesser one and like very few ones above their price, period."
1514,4,Estoy contento con mi compra.<br /><br />Es un producto nuevo de buena calidad y de una marca prestigiosa.<br /><br />Saludos y gracias
1515,5,"These earphones are very comfortable and lightweight. The sound is very clean, clear, and a tad on the bright side. Bass is not a strong point on these but it doesn't make my music sound like it's lacking in any way. Bass heavy music will not sound too great as lower bass frequencies will not sound as clean.<br /><br />I originally had the original x10 (without the microphone) but I sent it to Klipsch due to my left earpiece developing a rattle after a year of heavy usage in the gym. I received a brand new pair of x10i earphones in retail packaging as a replacement which is incredible. I have never received a level of customer service like this from any other company before. The warranty and customer service alone should be enough to warrant a purchase of these earphones. E-mail responses are prompt and the warranty exchange was done very, very quickly.<br /><br />No worry purchase. Klipsch has gained a customer for life.<br /><br />Edit: I just found out that I got an x10i replacement due to the x10 version being discontinued. Regardless, I am happy with the product!"
1516,5,"disks are packaged in handy reusable container, and play well in my Samsung player.  Probably not archieval quality.  Have a nice day."
1517,4,"Absolutely LOVE the size of the clip!! I see all the people with the HUGE Ipod's on there arm and to me that is NOT comfortable, I just &#34;clip&#34; this on the pocket of my wind pants and it never comes off. We did have one that the screen quit very quickly but since we liked it so much I ordered another one and this one has worked flawlessly."
1518,5,"I keep all of my music on my desktop computer in the back of my house, which is where I listen most of the time.  Sometimes I want to listen to that music in multiple locations - mostly in my living room which is on the other side of the house.  I have wi-fi, but I do not like the wireless streaming audio options out today.  So, this cable functions as my delivery system - music from my office to my living room.<br /><br />For optical cables, the only thing that matters is if the signal gets there.  Despite the long run (50 ft), this cable works perfect!  Make sure you set the digital output on your computer to a sampling rate that your receiver can receive and decode (44.1, 48, and/or 96 khz)."
1519,5,Great build quality. No image issues. Looks like it will last for a long time. No complaints and would buy again.
1520,3,Bought this to use with my iPod 5th generation and my MacBook Pro 13 (early 2011). Works fine in both. Sound is good and microphone does a good job on Skype.
1521,5,"Seems to work well. No problems that I can tell. Good value, fast shipping. Gee, it's hard to talk about this in to many words."
1522,5,"After all the research and bad reviews on other converters and the naysayers, I picked this one and am happy with it."
1523,5,I have Dish Network with built in Bluetooth. I can now listen to my movies with out the wife telling me to turn down the sound. Saved my marriage! Takes no batteries it recharges off my USB port and last for hours. This product was cheep at the price I paid.<br /><br />Roger1k
1524,5,"Great sound, nice bass response. These are a great value to replace the OEM ear buds on any music player."
1525,1,"These headphones stopped working after 2 days! Not worth the money, just get the original headphones. They didn't even send me new ones like they said they would after I complained about how they broke."
1526,1,Missing power cord and remote.  Very noisy when powered up using appropriate cord. Unacceptable. Quick credit was appreciated. Thank you.
1527,5,"I just bought this and installed it. I have to say I'm impressed, especially with the wireless sub. My wife was complaining not hearing clearly from the (Sony Bravia XBR6) TV's speakers. Here are the pros and cons:<br /><br />Pros:<br />1 - Receiver has many input options<br />2 - Because of 1, my setup was a breeze. My TV, PS3, and HTPC all hooked up to the receiver via HDMI. From open box to fully setup, less than 30 mins.<br />3 - The sub woofer goes behind the sofa in a corner.<br />4 - Unit goes into standby mode when my TV is off and automatically turns on, when the TV is on. I use the TV's remote to control the volume. When I switch input to my HTPC, the receiver automatically switches to that audio connection.<br />5 - Sounds coming from the system are so rich and amazing. I can now hear background musics and sounds, where I couldn't with the TV speakers.<br />6 - I was surprised to find that it also included FM radio.<br />7 - Optical cable was included for digital audio.<br />8 - This is the best part of the pros...my wife is happy with it :)<br /><br />Cons:<br />1 - High Speed HDMI cable is not included. Luckily I had a spare.<br />2 - FM tunner and presets UI could be a little bit better designed. But no big deal. Figured it out as soon as I got the layout of the new remote."
1528,3,well i got my order today well what you know on time but got lost with the 5 e-mails i sent i don't know what to say
1529,1,"took me a minute to figure out why my ps3 and all my other 1080p devices were not appearing on my 1080p projector after buying this cable, until i switched over to my 720p apple tv and it was working fine. this cable can't handle 1080p, on any device i own, don't buy."
1530,5,Belkin ties are cheap and very useful.  I would recommended to everyone.  It's alot cheaper than if you buy them at Fry's.
1531,5,This is a top quality audio cable at a moderate price point. I purchased to connect my smartphone audio to a big stereo. Works as advertised and seems like it will last a long time.
1532,5,This is a very heavy duty HDMI cord that i am glad only took 3 days to arrive at my home.
1533,5,"I tried to use a generic cable to attach my tablet to a TV without any luck. I decided to give it another try with a different cable, and I am glad I chose to get this cable from BlueRigger. The finish of the cable is excellent, and the price I paid for it was great."
1534,5,just what I needed to start using my new TV<br />easy to use - had no problem connecting it to my new TV
1535,5,This was a hard connector to find. I have a 15 foot mini HDMI cable for an old Transformer TF101 and did not want a second cable around for the new tablet so I purchased the adapter.  It came quickly and works great.
1536,5,"My speakers are about the size of the ones in the pix and they have sat on the floor for a couple of years.<br /><br />At that size, it just looks like you forgot they were there.<br /><br />The stands were easy to put together. I can see why people had difficulty threading the wires through the posts. You have to take the posts apart, thread them through the bottom, then through the plastic insert and make sure it is in place, then kink the end of the wires just a bit. Push the wires up through the smaller pipe and catch them at the hole at the top (I used a large paper clip.). Not real easy, but not really hard, either.<br /><br />The glass and metal look goes well with my electronics stand. There are a couple ways of attaching the speaker, but I used the simplest: The sticky tape that came with the stands. The &#34;shelf&#34; on the top is plenty large enough to hold them.<br /><br />Now my speakers look like they are where they should be and the sound for my TV, etc., is actually somewhat better."
1537,5,"What can I say, it's an Ipod and it's very NICE. It has so many feature, it keeps my husband occupied for hours."
1538,5,"Initially I bought these headphones for my daughter who always loses the smaller ones.  When we heard the sound, it was just amazing!  The animal print and the price were added bonuses!"
1539,5,"This antenna is great! It's white on one side and black on the other so that it matches your decor. The reception is fantastic at about 93%. I live in NYC and I have 44 channels for free... adding Netflix and Hulu Plus and saying bye bye, Cable!"
1540,5,"I ordered this bulb when I started to notice the screen on my Mitsubishi 65 inch DLP, flickering. I am very pleased to say this bulb works great! It was easy to replace and now the picture looks like it did when it was new. I actually had to adjust the video settings on the television because out was too bright!"
1541,5,"Like many have said, there's no real reason to spend $20+ on HDMI cables.  You're just feeding marketing hype.  These cables are all you need.  In fact, there's cheaper ones out there that perform just as well, but these seemed like a nice professional set for a few bucks more.  So here's another 5-star rating for this set of great cables."
1542,4,"Very simple device. Easily set up and worked as stated. I use it to convert the signal from a RCA composite video output jack, on a security camera DVR, to a VGA input on a 17&#34; computer monitor. I already had the old unused 17&#34; computer monitor. This StarTech.com converter saved me from spending $100 to $150 to replace the defective original 20&#34; TV monitor."
1543,5,"I bought one to connect my ipad and iphone to my bose quietcomfort 15 headphones.<br /><br />I was able to remove the bose cable and plug this in directly,  the little plug that came with it was just long enough.<br />Paired easily to my apple devices and I used some double stick tape to  hold it up to the left can.<br />Since Bose doesnt make a blue tooth adapter for their cans this is one good option.<br />The only problem is the cable is tough to plug in and comes out easily.  I used a small straw to hold the plug in straight when I inserted the plug in"
1544,3,Fast delivery and excellent customer service. I ordered two and neither worked upon arrival. I kind of felt as though I wasn't believed by the gal I emailed because she said that had never happened where two items were defective. despite that I had prompt service to exchange with the prior company. The item is alright although I thought it would be a little better quality. I may be just a little critical.
1545,5,".......for the money it is a good purchase. Music is clear, dock works well. We use it in our office."
1546,5,"I was doubtful about this product because of the great price. Boy, was I proven wrong! What a great speaker!"
1547,5,"The initial RCA was defective, a simple e-mail was all it took to get a replacement device with no hassle.  I appreciated the committment to excellent customer service for a relatively cheap electronic device."
1548,4,"High quality cable, seems to be put together very well. Shipped very quickly. Would recommend this product and merchant to others."
1549,4,Looks good and solid and it will be installed in the ceiling of my Garage ( Mancave ) so I'll have sounds when working on my Bike .
1550,5,"This is the EU adapter for certain Motorola chargers that accept Motorola slide-on adapters when the flat, U.S.-style blades, are folded."
1551,1,"After my Logitech 550 broke, I decided to go with another brand.  Worst mistake ever.  The functionality of this device stinks.  It was so difficult to program even the basic functions of the remote.  Setting up the macros was rather inconvenient.  And the worst part of it was that the rechargable battery didn't even last a year.  The touch screen was fun, but also was way too sensitive.  It was not user friendly at all.  Don't waste your money on this remote."
1552,5,"Finally decided to purchase a second for my mothers PC. I've had the first one for nearly a year now and it still works great. No issues with compatibility. Using a Corsair non-modular 750w on one PC, and a Corsair modular AX850 on another PC."
1553,5,I have two TVs Connected one a Mitsubishi 65 inch and one 42 inch Sharp LED<br />The Sharp is on a 25 ft Mediabridge ultra series HDMI cable. This Setup gives me<br />HD At both Tvs without paying for two cable boxes.I control both TVs with LOGITECH TV Keyboard
1554,1,In less then six months these the end of the ear bud that goes to the jack was messed up where I could only hear one side.  I attempted to return it to Sennheiser via their return system and they shipped the product back to me without replacing it or repairing the jack.
1555,5,It took me 5 minutes to get it set up and it sounds great. I couldn't have made a better choice.
1556,4,"These headphones are amzing, i heard nothing but good things about them and they were right. the only prop that i woud have whith them would be that you need an amp to get the real jucie out of these bad boys...... man they sound good!!!!!!!!!"
1557,4,They do what they are meant to do. I didn't have a wire stripper so used knife to strip the wire. I would recommend it to others.
1558,5,"These earbuds are very comfortable, have a nice sound and come with several different rubber ear pieces so that you get the right fit. The travel case is nice and is small enough that you can take it anywhere."
1559,5,"Bought this for our college age son.  He loves it and uses it everyday.  He mentioned that the instruction manual is not clear in some places, but he recommends the product."
1560,5,A use these headphones with an Ipod. They are lowder than the original phones. the fit better than the old round plugs supplied by Apple.
1561,4,"i was indecisive and what made me decide between this and another cable witch was shorter and a little more expensive was that i thought they were gold plated , since i thought it could change the sound , but whatever they are good and the sound is alright everything is normal or at least i cant notice , size is a little more i need but yeah , they feel sturdy and hard , good to buy"
1562,5,"Shipped fast! Despite reviews about too short of a cord, I did not find to be true. Plenty long enough for my needs and very good price. Would definitely buy again if this one were to ever die, as it is much more cost efficient than buying one from the manufacturer with an unknown life span."
1563,1,"did not work at all  Good thing it didnt cost much! No, point wasting more money or time to send it back!"
1564,5,"Absolutely to expensive for what you get , but the sound is great.  Its amazing you get so much sound out of those 2 small speakers.  You can hear the birds churp and planes flying when people are talking in the movie or show.  AMAZING !!!!"
1565,4,"i works and seems pretty neat. i purchased it as a gift, so i have only tested it to be sure it works. it didn't work on a coffee mug as shown in the ad. it did work on the empty box it came in, but not on another box that I tried it on. I guess it's just trial and error. the sound is not great, but I'm sure children would have fun with it."
1566,3,"I have no problems with the functions of the reciever, but they have chosen to print the buttons in gray on black. Further the text is quite small, so that in my stereo cabinet, where there is not a lot of light it's hard to read."
1567,5,"These are great speakers for a Home Theater project! Very easy to install and a great cost to value proposition. I like the \\""aim-able\\"" tweeters!"
1568,5,excelente producto recomiendo 100% buy buenos vendedores el producto es de buy buena calidad muy practico de poco peso y facil de instalar
1569,5,"Having never mounted a TV to the wall I was a bit skeptical that such an inexpensive mount would be sturdy enough.  When it arrived I was totally impressed by how sturdy it felt when I removed it from the box.  I was also impressed by the amount of hardware supplied with it, including the 6\\"" level and small bubble level which attaches to the mount.  Once a stud was located, installing the mount was a breeze.  I located the correct size screws and washers amongst the plethora of included hardware for the back of the TV and voila, my 37\\"" TV was on the wall, solid as a rock.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a full motion mount which doesn't require too much of an angle adjustment."
1570,5,"Exactly as descirbed. Used a switch between this and a laser project. If your project requires an external power souce, this is it"
1571,5,I've had these a couple of years and the sound these cans put out is amazing.  By far the best I've heard under 50 bucks.  But the sound quality sounds like it comes from headphones far more expensive.<br /><br />Listening to CDs is where they really shine.  I use them attached to my iPod and laptop quite a bit and it really is amazing how well they work like this also.
1572,5,I had a few difficulties with pairing the device - which were all fixed ASAP by incredibly helpful customer service staff at Hipe.  The device now works perfectly and I'm very happy!
1573,5,"In perfect condition, and no scratches or damage. Does what i need to do so thanks and i would definitely recommend. Thanks"
1574,5,"I love these headphones. I had a pair exactly like that before, got a new puppy and she chewed them up. So glad I could get the same kind again. Shipper was quick and hassle free."
1575,5,I gave this IPod as a birthday gift to my daughter. She loves it. She says that is fast and she enjoys watching videos on it.
1576,5,"They seem to do the trick.  Light, fits both single LPs and double LPs, and looks like they protect the covers quite well from deterioration.  Recommended."
1577,5,After knee surgery I was only allowed to swim laps (not using my legs). It was a death sentence until I discovered this product. Its a regular ipod shuffle but waterproof. amazing. Swimming is not a lot more fun now.
1578,4,"I bought these headphones because I needed some that could stay attached to my ear while I was running or working out. I ordered the clear headphones and they look awesome, so I was extremely pleased. However, I'm not too impressed with the sound quality. The sound very treble-y , and lacks a deep bass that I've grown accustomed to with my other in ear headphones that are made by koss. While the headphones did a great job at staying in my ear while I ran, the ear piece frequently became loose after about of mile of running, and beginning to sweat a bit inside my ears.Although this was a minor problem.All in all I still think these are great headphones for exercising and do a relatively good job compared to other exercise headphones I've used previously. These headphones aren't expensive so I will likely be recommending these to friends. So in conclusion, if your looking for great exercising headphones an aren't looking to spend a lot of money , then these are the best on amazon you'll find. Trust me I already did the research."
1579,3,"Ths housing was slightly to big and needed adjustmets. The handle on the rear of the housing broke off, plastic just cracked from the screw holding it to the housing. After I removed the handle assembly the housing seemed to slid into place a little better, but the screws were not the correct size. Had to replace the scrwes on the housing with the screws from the old housing. The housing also sits a little farther back than the original making it difficult to secure it in with the screws.<br /><br />Once all that was done, about an hour later, I was able to turn on the television. Lamp works well and picture looks as good as it ever did.<br /><br />If you are looking for a cheap alternative, about half the cost of an original replacement part,  and do not mind doing some tweaking to the product, I would try this product. For me it is for an older TV that I did not want to invest too much more money.<br /><br />If you want a no hassel replacement, spend the extra moned on an original replacement part."
1580,5,"I'm not an audiophile, but I like the footprint and power of the amp for what I use it for. I wired two flush mount ceiling speakers and then used mono inputs to my Mac, so now I have iTunes all over my house. Simple and high quality construction. Good and loud with little distortion at higher volumes, though with a young child in the house, I am not playing at high volume that often. Be aware there are not that many inputs, so depending on what you want to use it for, be careful."
1581,3,"Love the sound quality.  But for me, they tend to slip out when running and even sometimes when biking.  I'm not giving up yet, but the Skull Candy ones never fell out..."
1582,5,"I had already bought one of these for my workout room.  Loved it and after a few months was trying to find something similar for my kitchen, only with AM/FM radio.  After searching around and testing two different players with a radio, discovered I have really poor reception in the kitchen and basically got static.  So ruled out the AM/FM and just bought a second one of these.  Figured I can just use my iHeartRadio for radio playing.  (Will need to boost my wifi signal, but that's a different purchase. :))  Sound is excellent and great quality.  We have a one-story ranch house and when I turn it up, sounds great all over.<br /><br />In the summer, I've also taken it outside to use on the patio.  We have an outlet right there behind our grill, so plug in my iPod Touch and jam away.  :)  Our friends can also hook up their ipods or iphones and we get a wide variety of music that way.<br /><br />Comes with a handy little remote.  Its fairly small and was worried about losing it, so got some of the sticky Velcro strips and cut a small piece to put on each so now I can Velcro the remote to the back of the player when not in use."
1583,5,This item worked as advertised and excellent customer service.  I would do business again in the future with this vendor.
1584,5,"I'm pretty sure this works fairly well. I may have lost this one. If so, this review is for a different one that I bought at Guitar Center. If not, this product works well. I think..."
1585,5,"i wish that these cheap cd cases were even cheaper considering the quality, but its still cheaper than what it would cost in the store."
1586,5,"I have had an earlier version of this radio for many years, and wanted to buy a new one.  They are not available in stores, so I gave up.  Bright idea....go online.  I found it, and am delighted.  The sound is excellent, it picks up the stations I want, and  I am really happy to have found it."
1587,3,"I got these to replace my Apple ipod ear buds; these earbuds are slightly larger than the Apple brand , in turn after a few hours they become uncomfortable. They  have good sound , good bass, and has a cool case. I would have given a higher rating not for the oversized buds. For the money you can't beat it."
1588,5,This small speaker produces a good quality sound. I purchased this because my wife has a hearing loss and when I play sound only from my laptop or ipad it is not loud enough. It's small and easy  to use. When placed in the middle of a room it fills the air with clear sound. I first heard this speaker when a college rep gave a presentation to my students. Everyone in the room was impressed and said they will soon look into purchasing this speaker. You will be amazed at the sound quality! Price was also affordable!
1589,3,"Product worked good in the beginning after six months it went bad does not turn on at all no matter what you do, so sad,"
1590,5,"After getting and returning 2 dead ups units from Staples, I did what I should have done at the start and ordered one from Amazon. Came fast, was fully charged out of the box, and works fine. In a conversation with APC I found out that the reason the Staples units were dead is that they had apparently been sitting in inventory since January (it is now November) - the shelf life of an uncharged unit being 6-12 months."
1591,3,"For under $100, this soundbar was worth what I paid and it does an adequate job.  Don't expect window-rattling bass or surround-sound effects but I did get a significant improvement in sound quality when compared to the speakers in my flat-panel TV.  The sound is much richer and the separate bass unit adds significant depth to the sound.  It really is easy to install -just a couple of plugs and in a couple of minutes it was ready to go. Someday I'll pay (a lot) more money to get an actual surround-sound system but for now, this sub-hundred-dollar unit will fill the gap."
1592,5,"Yes, they work. Yes they are cheap. No there isn't much to say about them otherwise. If you need 'em, buy 'em."
1593,5,This product works as advertised - audio quality is good and headphones are comfortable.  Haven't had any issues with it running out of battery; recharger cradle is easy to use.
1594,5,"This is the 2nd TEAC CD recorder I have and my other TEAC recorder still works fine. I needed another so I won't have to trudge up and down the stairs between attaching the recorder to my stereo or computer. It is like having an old tape recorder. Very useful for making cds of lps, tapes, soundtracks to DVD live shows and recording on-line. I would recommend this player highly to those who still like to listen to cds."
1595,5,"These were the perfect fit for my system.  They were thicker than your standard cable, yet flexible enough to run through the entertainment center."
1596,5,Just like the original product. There was no difference but the slight color variation. The sound quality is just the same.
1597,1,"Extremely basic device. MP3s are stored in a folder hierarchy which you have to manually navigate to play music. Once music is playing, a series of long-presses allows you to finally get back to the folder structure to change the music.<br /><br />The biggest issue for me is that you cannot listen to music while the device is plugged-in to USB power. It immediately goes into a \\""charging\\"" mode, in which you can only watch the charging icon on the screen, and nothing else."
1598,1,"--Box does not contain an actual adapter, only a usb cable with a small charger tip.<br />--Followed instructions to charge with usb connected to computer. Wouldn't charge.  Power button wouldn't work.<br />--Tried charging with two other roughly equivalent Samsung adapters.  Wouldn't charge.<br />--On-off button wouldn't turn on, even when plugged in.<br /><br />Determined that \\""dead on arrival\\"".<br /><br />Was a total waste of time and money."
1599,1,"Purchased these just a few weeks ago, to use for work calls as my iPhone earbuds were uncomfortable for long periods of time (though reliable!). Already the left earbud is malfunctioning. Not working at all. I take great care to store them properly, they aren't thrown in a bag or anything. Cannot believe they already don't work. I have 6-year old iPod buds that have never had this issue.<br />Disappointed and will not buy Altec again."
1600,4,"Got these, can't say I was expecting much out of them but it totally took me by surprise when I was listening to something and I actually heard base. I didn't know that song had base. The sound quality is pretty good, but it doesn't filter out the static very well like some of my other ones do. That's why I only give them 4 stars. But for what I payed they're really good.<br /><br />I think it's worth mentioning that these headphones go lower than my laptop speakers and even my TV monitor."
1601,5,"I've purchased several of these this year and last year, and keep coming back for more. They're simple, inexpensive, and work wonders. The design is thinner than some other cables, which has its own special benefits.<br /><br />With a much thinner design, you can more easily bend the cable, or allow it to fit into tight spaces, without too much worry. For instance, I have other brands of fiber cable, some of them 2-3x thicker, and they were not able to fit behind a TV of a recent install I did, without putting too much stress on the neck of the cable going into the port.<br /><br />These thinner ones were perfect, they fit right in, and don't have any issues with a tighter bend. For anyone curious, the ends of the fiber are not polished.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />* Inexpensive, great value!<br /><br />* Thinner protective insulation than other brands, which can be beneficial<br /><br />* Signal quality is great, as I would expect"
1602,5,"The sound is Bose quality, the fit is fair but I get very comparable sound with my $20.00 deep case ear buds. The speaker wire is too short and with the adaptor it puts a heavy swing in the line when doing cardio. Not worth the price. It is possible if Bose changes the ear piece to be more of a ear bud so it can be inserted into the ear canal for better sound delivery. The arm case is to small for most men I bet.I HAVE FOUND THAT I CAN PUT OTHER BRAND EAR BUDS SO I GET A BETTER FIT AND WOW WHAT A PLEASURE."
1603,3,"I tried them on and first thing I noticed is that they were fairly tight on my head.  I have a slightly larger than average head but still, these would be tight on anyone.  The second was that these are NOT meant for people with glasses.  If you have glasses these are NOT meant for you, do not buy.  The third thing I noticed is that when I tried to use them the red was slightly off.  It's not so bad that they are unusable but it is still noticeable (blue is perfect though).  I only bought these because they were cheap and I wanted to try the 3d features on some game I had so they work for their purpose but if you want 3d glasses that you would wear for long periods of time or need good quality 3d glasses these are NOT for you."
1604,5,"I have tried Bose, Klipsch and other in-ear buds and Etymotic wins HANDS DOWN!!<br /><br />Been a long-time customer and had an issue with the current set.  Sent them back and they truly stand behind their products.  In trying to \\""limp\\"" by without them, purchased BOSE MIE2i and the Klipsch with HORRIBLE results.  Once the ambient noise exceeds the current volume in your ears, you CANNOT hear the music.  With the Etymotic, I can ride a motorcycle and still hear the highs/lows in a Symphony.  I have a pair of the ER4p that I have had for well over 10 years without ANY problems. Net/net, don't waste your time with anything other than the BEST for the $$$."
1605,5,I am in the military and my job requires me to spend hours a day in the water. I attached the ipod to my dive mask and it works great. I have used the product for long ocean fins and even pool workouts. I have not experienced any malfunctions with the product. Great sound under water.<br />I do have a couple recommendations for anyone buying this product.<br /><br />1) organize your music by playlists. Its hard to change tempo of music if it is organized by artist. Maybe use the genius mix.<br /><br />2) use the biggest attachment possible for the waterproof headphones. It may cause slight pressure but it keeps the water out and keeps the sound quality from being muffled.<br /><br />3) take your time setting up the heapdhones. It is important to manage the cord properly otgerwose you end up with too much cord hanging and the earplugs will come out or you make it too tight and the earplugs come out. If you have a hard time getting the excess cord managed just leave extra and tuck it under the goggle/mask strap after you have put the headphones in your ears.
1606,5,I recently added speakers to my patio and quickly found my existing amp didn't have a 2nd set of outputs.  This amp was perfect for the job and the 2nd input makes it easy to use an iPod or other alternate input device.
1607,5,This was exactly the right part we needed to fix our tv. It came in about a week and cost about 1/3 of the price from Mitsubishi
1608,4,I felt this bracket was sturdy and served its purpose. It fit to the TV fine and was fairly easy to install.
1609,5,"I have this little beauty (and I mean that literally) driving a pair of Sonus Faber Concertinos, which are relatively inefficient (86dB/W/m) and should ideally have an amp ten times as powerful. As long as you don't expect more than what 14W can deliver (which, frankly, is more than enough for pleasant listening with most speakers), you will be amazed. The sound is as neutral as anyone could ask in any price range. And in its power range, I would put this up against seriously expensive stuff costing 100 times as much or more. The TI preamp and NXP power amp chips used in this unit are amazing when used in a well-designed system, which, from listening, this appears to be (I haven't seen a circuit diagram).<br /><br />On top of very competent performance, we have a gorgeous package: high quality components, simple, clean lines and markings, and fit-and-finish that's top class. Just looking at it, you'd expect it to cost $200 or more. All of this at $50 is a surprising bargain.<br /><br />At the moment, my source material is a very old (mid-'80s) Dutch-built Philips CD player with remarkable sonic quality, going through a [[ASIN:B00006I5J0 Niles Audio AXP-1]] 5-input selector. My turntable is awaiting a tube phono preamp currently under construction on the shop bench, and if I manage to remember to, I'll post an update on how that sounds with the A1.<br /><br />The one important thing a buyer should be aware of is that 14W will be marginally enough power if you intend to use this to drive low-sensitivity speakers in a large room. That is not a weakness of the product so much as fact of what 14W is capable of. If you need more power, a possible alternative might be [[ASIN:B006K7AT26 MUSE M50 2x50w Tripath Class T Stereo Hifi Amplifier]]. This 50W/ch amp is more expensive and doesn't come with the AC power block (which will add at least another $10), but it appears to be well built."
1610,5,"Sweet headphones at a sweet price! Bass and treble reproduce accurately for crisp highs and deep lows with very little distortion. Not Sennheiser HD650 or better quality but are almost comparable to HD518's and nearly as good as Beats Pro. Very comfortable for short wear durations of 30-45 minutes. Worth it for cheap, worry free, listening; where a need for near disposable in price point headphones are required. The plastic construction is quite sturdy and solid feeling. Should last for some time. Putting the headphones on require some practice as they tend to fold up or have the DJ Style earcups swivel out of position. Overall an outstanding performance and value in the $20-$100 price range. Cheap only in price!"
1611,5,"I bought three of these to go with my TP-Link TL-WR1043ND wireless router, which after re-flashing with dd-wrt I use in \\""client mode\\"" in order to reach our building's Access Point.<br /><br />The AP is a crappy old Netgear thing with maybe, at most, a three-inch antenna. It's located in the landlord's office at the front of the building. I live on the second floor, down the hall. The signal has to travel thru concrete, drywall, stainless-steel sheeting, and glass to reach the AP. With these antennas (and careful aiming) my client WR1043 is receiving the AP's signal at -73dB and a noise floor of -95dB for a signal quality of approx. 24%. I'm amazed!"
1612,4,"I like the Sansa's because I use the FM radio a lot as well as the MP3's.  Even though it is small/compact the menu screen is good size and easy for me to use. Some reviewers have complained that the battery life isn't as long as others, but I have found it more than adequate."
1613,5,"I bought My Laptop Cooling Pad with 3-Fans in United Integral Inc. through  Amazon in August 2012. It works perfect and almost silent. This item is cheap - $4+ (plus free shipping), has blue LED lighting, cools laptop enough, does not need electric supply - works from USB inlet on laptop...What else?"
1614,5,"Mount worked great.  Used it for a 50 inch LCD and it is rock solid.  I really like the design that I can change the tilt with just pushing/pulling on the top and bottom of the set.  I tweeked the tention on that just a bit, but that was also easy.  Was surprised how small a package it came. but not much assembly requried (only 6 screws to dot the assembly, not counting mounting it to the wall).  Again, very easy.  Anyone claiming to have a problem is probably not reading the instructions."
1615,5,"I purchased 2 of these adapters before going to Europe this summer.  I had no issues and can confirm them working just fine in Spain, France, Italy and Czech Republic.  Remember to make sure whatever you plug into this can convert AC 100-240V or you will have to buy a separate adapter.  This just converts the American socket to European socket, not the voltage!"
1616,5,"fast  shipping, have it plugged from my laptop to 42' tv and everything looks great! long enough for me to sit on my bed and use the laptop. for 51cents? yes!"
1617,5,"[[ASIN:B00316263Y BlueRigger High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet 6.6 Feet (2m) - Supports 3D and Audio Return [Latest Version]]]<br /><br />We bought this 2 pack for our new Samsung 55\\"" LED TV.  We used one for the TV to Cable box and the other for DVD to TV.  We are getting an amazing picture which the cables must be contributing to.  We plan on getting additional sets for our other HD tv's."
1618,1,Do not get this for it does not have any response. The one that worked was Ultra ULT40396 USB to eSATA Adapter which works fine for my esata external harddrive from Iomega.
1619,5,"I can't believe the terrible reviews! I had this clock for 6 years before I dropped it on the floor and my cat chewed on it. A few days later I thought the battery died but replacing the battery didn't help. The clock was dead. When it was working, it was easy to set and always reliable. I trusted this clock over the alarm on my cell phone. Maybe I was lucky with a great clock."
1620,5,"This shelf was just perfect for the things we needed to put under our TV. The cable management helps to hide all the cables and makes the whole thing look a lot neater. Overall it worked out great, just make sure to follow the appropriate directions for your type of wall."
1621,5,I was hesitant about this unit before purchasing. I wasn't blown away by it's slightly dated look but I took the chance because so many of the other fancier-looking iPod radios are poorly reviewed. But this item was nice works great sounds good to.<br /><br />thanks!
1622,5,These ear cushions are the same that come with the Motorla S10-HD wireless headphones. They appear to be exact copies.<br />Shipping was very fast.
1623,5,"Since I bought this Mini VGA to HDMI Converter, I am really enjoying it. I used it with my DELL VOSTRO 1500 laptop. It is very easy to set up this device. You just simply plug the device with the VGA output. No power adapter is needed but you need to connect an USB cable as the power supply. Connect the 3.5mm Audio cable between this device and my laptop as audio input. I used a 10ft Media Bridge HDMI cable to connect the device and HDTV.  The results turned out very impressive. I got outstanding picture and quality sound. Everything works well with a simple set up."
1624,5,"good wire, i used it to hook up speakers in my car, bedroom, and hook up an ooga horn and air horns in my car. it goes a long way and is easy to work with. very good price."
1625,5,After researching many bluetooth wireless products I was at a big box store and got to play with this-and took it home. it blew the other systems away sound quality wise as well as with its lower price. Only nit I would pick is that these (all comparable bluetooth systems as well) is that the range should be better. There are bluetooth headsets for motorcycles that operate line of sight-rather than 30 feet. Definitely happy with this purchase. It fits on the kitchen counter for my wife and will travel with us easily.
1626,5,"The adapter is really cheap, but it works well. The only drawback is that it does not have symbols to tell you which RCA is left or right. I need to distinguish them by myself."
1627,5,Hooked it into HDMI port on tv.  Then one for dvd and second for blu-ray players. Worked perfectly.  Soon as selected player loads dvd it kicks in first time and every time since.
1628,5,This cable was exactly what I needed to hook up my DVD player to my new HD television.  It was delivered within just a few days. The hookup took me less than a minute to complete and I am a grandma!!
1629,5,I have no complaints. I  like the materials and it works well and people like the color. I buy again and highly recommended.
1630,2,"I agree with many others that the touch pad is too sensitive.  Don't like that once you reach Z in songs you have to scroll all the way back up to get to A...A doesn't automatically start after Z. If you are scrolling through songs and accidently \\""touch\\"" a song (sensitivity issue again!) it takes you back to the last song you played so you have to scroll back up or down again. PAIN!!  Have had mine since Dec 2011 and had to trash it at Best Buy because the on/off button on top won't work. Charged it all night, played a song then tried to lock the  screen to go walking but the lock wouldn't work.  When it finished the song it was on, the machine turned off and I can't start it again.  While it was under manufacturer warranty and they gave me a new one,have to upload all 900+ songs again.  NOT HAPPY!  I miss the turn wheel but like this size and capacity."
1631,5,"I'm admittedly not a huge bose fan and I consider myself an aspiring audiophile.  I've invested thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours of research into my home theater sound system so, I consider myself knowledgeable on this topic (but not necessarily an expert).  This little speaker sounds amazing... and I'm constantly surprised at the quality of sound it puts out and it's ability to fill the room with sound.  The only thing this speaker is missing is a speakerphone so I can accept an incoming call like the jambox has.  However, I would recommend this speaker over the jambox... i've heard both and this is far superior."
1632,4,"I have no regrets going with this cheaper mount for my 32\\"" LCD TV.  It does everything that I would expect."
1633,4,This item was ordered as a backup for my bulb so i would not miss any of the Olympics. I ordered and received item in a timely item and item was as specified on listing. would order from them again
1634,4,"These headphones are great for what they are orginally made for. No tangling earphones.<br /><br />These aren't what I called, stereo junkies headphones. There no setting to change the sounds coming out of the headphones.<br /><br />The earphones do come with 3 sets of different sized rubber earbuds. I will admit, there are times where the sounds coming from the ear phones sound like echos. But I think that is more dependent on the genre of song being played.<br /><br />90% of the time, the earphones are perfectly fine with any type of music being played.<br /><br />The upsides and downsides to these earphones are that they are actually like ear plugs. You can have a moderate volume level on your IPOD and if you are outside, you can't hear people talking to you/surroundings. Good if you want to focus in on music. So its great on noise cancellation, if you like that. Bad if you actually want to hear other sounds around you in your environment.<br /><br />The rubber earbuds also act like cushions/buffer for your inner ear, so even if you accidently hit the volume too loud, it never comes off as shreiking/screaming your ears off like other traditional earphones.  Perhaps because the rubber ear buds act like cushion = occassional distortion/lack of clarity in some genre of songs.<br /><br />But overall, this is a nice and different product for those who hate tangling their earphones. Plus it looks cool and because it has a zipper which by the way is made very strong, its very adjustable to any type of clothing you wear.  Plus you can zip them up all the way and put it in your pocket and not have to worry that the earphones are all tangled up.<br /><br />It works as intended. Nothing more, nothing less."
1635,5,"Bought new speakers for my computer and was annoyed by the constant background noise during periods of silence.<br />This cable corrected that just fine.  Would love to buy a shorter one also, but I haven't found one yet.<br />10' is a bit long for the second one that I need."
1636,5,We are pleased with our purchase of the RCA 1400R flat TV antenna.  It is for a small TV in our bedroom and it serves our purpose very well.<br />We wanted it primarily to watch network news when we go to bed.
1637,5,"For those who don't know, MoCA is a networking standard that allows ethernet traffic to pass over coaxial cable.  This allows you to extend your home network without running ethernet cable.  Wireless is convenient but is slower and is often subject to interference from other devices.<br /><br />I'm using several of these diplexers in my home network running over MoCA.  These work excellent for separating the high frequency MoCA signal from the CATV signal.  This feature is useful because standard CATV splitters and amplifiers don't allow the high frequency MoCA signal to pass through.  With satellite diplexers you can separate the frequencies and pass the signals to splitters that can pass the MoCA signal to the other devices around your home.<br /><br />I get 100Mbps over the network using these and a Holland GHPNA-4 splitter.<br /><br />I'm definitely going to be using more of these when I expand my network."
1638,2,"I found that these headphones were durable, and the sound was good.  As I think the in-ear headphones are for idiots who want to go deaf, it feels a little odd - and likely unhealthy in the long term - to have the rubber bud shoved right into your ear, though.<br /><br />I have one major complaint, which in itself would make my review a one-star: they STINK after a while. STINK. Why? The rubber bud in your ear collects sweat. It's like a microbiologist designed them to collect gunk from your ear. I thought my t-shirts were poorly laundered, or my napsack shoulder straps had just collected too much sweat over the years. No, it was the headphones. And you can't clean them, lest you want to run the risk of damaging the speakers. So, prepare for months of stale sweat-bacteria to build up to the point where you go to the gym thinking you have a B.O. problem..."
1639,1,"I've owned these headphones for two years and have had them replaced under the warranty exchange program by Logitech. They sound incredible but the problem is that they break extremely easily and the cable is extremely fragile.  They just send me a replacement two months ago which I kept in the box until two weeks ago and it broke yet again.<br /><br />It's just not worth the time and hassle to deal with Logitech over this. The quality has suffered since Logitech acquired Ultimate Ears and I will be looking for another brand as a result of this.<br /><br />In full transparency, I own the TripleFi 10Vi headphones which are the same as these with the exception of the controls on the cable. I will leave this same review there too."
1640,5,Good sound quality. Is very comfortable and durable. Blocks outside sounds out very well. Love the nylon wrapping around the cord.
1641,5,Got these for when I listen to music on my computer - don't want my husband to have to hear if he's not in the mood. Sound quality is excellent and in fact the first thing I did was turn the volumn down! Really great. And pretty too.
1642,5,"I wish I would have gone with the 16GB instead of the 8GB. I have already used all but about 1GB and only have about half the music I want to load on it. Guess I will need to look at up grading at Christmas, purchase the 16GB for my Christmas present."
1643,5,I have purchased many items from GLS and will continue to do so. The build quality is amazing. They are very easy to use and set up. The only thing that would be a knock against them but not enough to take a star is the size of them. They are pretty big. Make sure that you have a good size speaker wire or they will not work well.
1644,4,"I had a 2nd generation Shuffle for years and it finally gave out on me. So I replaced it with the newest version immediately- even though I have an iPhone, I love the way the Shuffle has become the ubiquitous \\""mix tape\\"" for our generation. It's so easy to use, and I actually LIKE not having a screen or information to deal with- it's just music. You load it up using iTunes, snap earbuds on it, and hit play, and you've got music right at your fingertips.<br /><br />While I love the new smaller size, there's a few things I *don't* like about the newest Shuffle.<br /><br />I hate that there's no blinking light when the Shuffle is paused. I didn't realize how much I depended on that until I realized that the only way to tell if the Shuffle was sleeping, playing, or paused was by holding an earbud to my ear. So no more quick battery checks by pressing the play button.<br /><br />I also hate that the battery/play indicator light isn't on BOTH sides of the shuffle anymore. When I have it clipped to my pocket, and it's upside down, I have to unclip it to check battery life, play status, etc.<br /><br />It's funny, but I never realized how much I depended on that little light, but now that it does less and is missing from one side of the unity, I'm missing it.<br /><br />I would always recommend this product, but I wish that they would bring back some of the features that they abandoned along the development process."
1645,5,Couldn't ask for a better wireless speaker. Bose has got this sound that no one can seem to match.  Syncing with my windows phone and iPad 3 was a cinch.  Love it!
1646,5,This product subwoofer cable was just as good or not better than monster cable and the price is great.thank you.
1647,5,"I was one of those iPod Touch users that got fed up with using iTunes to upload music to my device.  It was never an easy process.  The Galaxy 4.0 is an excellent non-phone Android device.  Gingerbread 2.3 is fine but if you want to change the look a bit, I highly recommend downloading the Golauncher app.  Everything looks a lot slicker now. I added a 32gb card and all I do is drag and drop my music and I'm ready to go.  The 4 inch screen is also perfect to surf the web (I recommend Opera browser)and playing games.  The screen is sharp and have no complaints.  The Android market offers more than enough apps for anyone to enjoy.  If there are any negatives it would be that the hardware itself is kind of cheapish when compared to Apple devices.  The plastic back on the Galaxy seems very flimsy but then again I won't be removing it very often.  The last thing I will say is that this device has convinced me to purchase an Android phone over Apple's iPhone next time my contract is up."
1648,2,"Most of the audio extension cables Amazon sells have terrible reviews. I don't remember what this one has since it's been a year since I got it. It worked fine for a while - almost a whole year of normal indoor use - and last week it finally crapped out. So if you only need a cable for one year... or less, if other reviews are to be believed... then I guess this is fine?"
1649,1,"I bought these as a gift for my girlfriend's birthday in January.  She needed a pair of headphones that would stay put while at the gym.  They worked great up until this last weekend, when both earpieces completely stopped working.  I thought it may have been my phone's headphone jack, but an older pair worked perfectly.<br /><br />We did not put a lot of wear and tear on them either.  They were used, on average, once a week for 1-2 hours.  It's unfortunate they only lasted 6 months because we were quite happy with them up until they stopped working."
1650,5,Item was just as described. I finally got the right one for the right price! I recommend this item to all Ipad 2 users.
1651,5,This was a good product with real reasonable price. I was able to convert some of the stuff from compact cassette to digital audio usnig this.
1652,2,had these four months and they went out today. they worked fine up until today so possible one in a million type thing.
1653,1,"What can I say. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. Light lasted 2 Hours. 120 Minutes for $40.00 + $8.00 to shipe it back. That comes out to $24.00 an hour or $0.4 a minute. The co. said they would refund me for the light but I'm out $8.00 for shipping. Luckily I had a back-up philips bulb that continued to work once I received the new wiering harness. If I had to do it again, I would spend the extra money and purchase the Philips bulb with housing instead of the MADE IN CHINA \\""I Think\\"" Bulb & Housing.<br />The man @ philips said thet get back 1 bulb in 500 sold. He said the generic bulbs are 20 bulbs returned out of 500 sold.  Not the worst odds but go figure, I was one of the 20 people who had to send it back."
1654,4,hooked my cellphone up in the kitchen and the speakers worked by the pool. The bass is so so but overall they are fine.
1655,5,"I wanted a white cable to match my baseboards, and this cable was the least expensive option that I could find. In my experience, a white cable generally costs more than a black cable, and this cable was no exception to that rule.  The cable works fine, judging from the low-frequency rumbling that my sub-woofer makes."
1656,5,"I'm no audiophile, but I had some extra $$ to indulge in some really great earbuds to use with my iPod when working out and my hubby told me how thrilled he was with these...(I had been looking in the $25 range).  I read reviews for these and the cheaper ones and found that no product was perfect, but decided to trust the hubby (and feed his ego) and buy this indulgent Klipsch headset.<br /><br />I was BLOWN AWAY by how superior the sound was when I first tried them out...I had read about the 'burn in' period and all of that so wasn't expecting a lot right out of the box, but the sound was way beyond any ear buds I've had in the past and I've had some good ones as gifts. (the only reason I was looking is because my old Bosch ones kept losing one of the ear bud covers...so annoying!)<br /><br />As a woman, I was surprised that I had to use the largest ear buds to make them stay in my ears, so wonder how well these petite looking things will work for someone with huge ears...and, yes, I used the 180 degree insertion method (read other review for the details)...<br /><br />All in all, these are awesome and would be an amazing gift for someone you REALLY like..."
1657,1,"I bought this in March and for the first two months it worked well without a problem. Then the box started to drop the connection after every two or three songs and the only way to get it back was to unplug the box and start it up all over again. Now the buttons respond only about half of the time when I press them. To make matters worse this is the WORST customer service I have dealt with. I have tried calling 4 times,  each time on hold for about an hour. The one time someone did pick up there was silence on their end for about a minute before they hung up. Screw Logitech."
1658,4,"This stereo system produces some amazing sounds. The range of highs and lows is impressive and with some of my CDs, I hear parts of the music that I hadn't even recognized before, something I attribute to the full range of sound that comes from this system. It's modern looking and quite attractive. I'm very pleased with the music that I hear from this unit. However, I have just a few concerns about it. The feature I was most interested in was the ipod connection capability because I wanted a way to listen to my long playlists on a good system. The ipod dock portion is surprisingly flimsy and while it works just fine, it does contrast with the solidity of the base unit.  This is why I keep the system high up and thus minimize the chance of the dock getting accidentally hit. It would not take a very big hit to break. Another quibble is the range of the remote control. You do need to basically stand directly in front of the unit for it to work, so no sharp angles, which for some might negate the usability of the remote. Also, in CD mode, the unit takes several seconds to load an mp3 CD (or any CD for that matter, but particularly, the mp3 burned CDs.). I wish this load speed were a bit faster. Once while listening to a CD, the unit suddenly turned off, which I attribute to its inability to read the CD. Overall, an amazing system with a few minor distractions. Recommended!"
1659,1,Volume doesn't work and/or is broke on it's highest level. It is impossible to listen to because it hurts my ears.<br />Enough said.
1660,1,"Don't waste your money on this item, there's a reason it only costs $2. I tried using it on my new Playstation 3 but it wouldn't work. I went to Walmart & bought one of their cheap models (9.95) & it worked fine."
1661,5,"These headphones are well worth your $7-10. Double flanges for extra noise cancelling (better than Skullcandy), bass response is incredible for this price range, at par if not better sounding than Skullcandy's bass due to a more full sounding high end. The only negative thing is that there is no double flange replacement that comes with, they come with a back up single flange bud if you lose one when pulling it out of your pocket.<br /><br />Bottom line, come for the noise cancelling, stay for the bass."
1662,5,"i got this because i work with several machines humming continuously around me. after getting tired of the headaches, i got this and it really relived my ears. It does pinch my ears a bit if i wear them too long. if i wear them all day, i start hearing my bones creaking and my heel hitting the floor really loudly. i think its because my ears are missing the sound and are amplifying my internal body sounds to compensate."
1663,5,Very sattisfied.  Bought this product for use in the US and can't find any fault with it.  I'd recommend it.
1664,2,"The three-button control does not work - I've tried it on an iPhone 3GS, iPod Shuffle and an iPod classic. No success. I sent an e-mail to the customer care department, but never got an answer. So all in all, it was a bad experience.<br /><br />Still, I think I'll try the Yurbuds without the 3-button control the next time. Just to give it another chance. They fit good in the ear and they do not hurt even after hours of workouts. The sound quality is not that good, though, and in cold weather you easily get feedback into the earphones when touching the cable."
1665,5,"I bought the Dual 3-way because of some of the reviews I have seen. I was willing to spend more on something a lot more higher end, but for out side why? I was very shocked when I wired them up. I play a wide range of music and the out put was good. The speakers put out some lows and the highs are good. The mids are a little over powering, but they are out door speakers and they are not a $200 set of speakers. What was really shocking is no matter where I am in my back yard, I still hear the music and the sound-high, lows, and mids didn't change. I do a lot of car audio and the one thing about car audio is the speaker placement (imigaging)Placing a set of speakers to where you get the full sound range without sound drop-off and not knowing where the sound is coming from. Placing the Dual's somewhat in the middle of my yard high up in the air (over a door way) and spaced apart about 10 to 15 feet. Walking around in my yard and I hear the music, but can't tell where the sound is coming from. Even with the mids being a little over powering and not being a high-end set of speakers. I still give the Dual 3-way 5 stars"
1666,4,"You can plug the cable into a kindle charger and charge it in a plug which I think is useful. Overall I like this product but I wish it organized music better, had a shuffle, and accepted more music formats. I can't even listen to some tracks I get from itunes."
1667,4,"I have one set of Yamaha speakers installed and was looking for a matching pair. The picture looked identical, but they don't match exactly. However, the ease of installation and quality is what we needed. Quick shipment!"
1668,2,"The power adapter works fine and dont run hot, but the conector in the picture is a 90 degree angle and the one they send is straight."
1669,5,"I tried the following items in different combinations and setup each antenna both amplified and non-amplified.<br /><br />Antennas:<br /> Winegard Company FL-5000 FlatWave HDTV Indoor Digital Flat Antenna -<br /> Winegard FV-HD30 FreeVision HDTV Antenna<br /> Mohu Leaf (Non Amplified)<br /> GE HDTV Quantum Antenna - Silver (24775) from target.<br /> RCA Simple antenna from Wal-Mart ANT112R<br /><br />Combiner/Splitter and Amplifier:<br /> 2-Port Bi-Directional Cable TV HDTV Amplifier Splitter Signal Booster with Passive Return Path<br /> CHANNEL PLUS 2512 DC + IR Passing 2-Way Splitter/Combiner<br /><br />I really wanted to ditch DISH network, I felt with Hulu, Netflix and HD OTA TV I'd be set. My main goal was to find something that would get all my local channels plus WTVD 11 ABC which is in VHF. Any other channels where icing on the cake.  I live in Cary, NC near RTP NC.  Antennaweb and TV fool says all my local channels are UHF and 22 miles or less from me with exception to ABC WTVD which is VHF. I am using Hauppauge WinTV-HVR-2250 PCI-E x1 Dual TV Tuner connected to my PC with Windows Media Center. I first tried each antenna individually in the same location and wrote down the channels they achieved and signal strength after rescanning. I then tried them in combination using the combiner and would add the amplifier to see if results were better. I found when I amplified the signal I would get channels from further away but then it distorted the local channels. I found the best setup to be from the Winegard Flatwave alone mounted on the wall in my office about 8 feet high.  The antenna is a little bit bigger than the Mohu Leaf but produces all the local channels except for ABC 11 which is VHF. Not a single setup I tired could get ABC 11.1 on WTVD. I even tried RCA simple antenna with bunny ears (dipoles). I found with the Winegard Flatwave that it reach so far away that I was able to get ABC from Greensboro on channel 45.1 in UHF. TVFool says the signal is 52.3 miles WOW! I was still skeptical and we had thunderstorms the other day. I was able to watch the channel 45.1 in heavy rain no issues,  I was in shock! So now I get all the major channels plus bunch of other channels. Total around 35 channels and some repeat from another region.<br /><br />The Mohu Leaf is comparable to the Winegard in appearance but the Winegard edges it out a bit in performance. I also like that the Winegard is not glossy and has a 15 foot cable to allow more flexibility in placement. Both produce very good results for the design and size.  In conclusion, I highly recommend Winegard Flatwave antenna and I hope this ends up helping someone trying to decide between which antennas to choose.<br /><br />Update: 8/8/2012<br />I still have the Winegard Flatwave and was working great but decide to get an antenna in the attic and run coaxial cabling to all 3 TVs. I choose this option because I had multiple TV's and didn't want to get an antenna for each.<br />Not everyone has this option but if you do I highly recommend this antenna: Winegard HD7694P High Definition VHF/UHF Antenna. I used Antennaweb and my iPhone with free compass app to find best direction to point the antenna.<br />I decided to use 2-Port Bi-Directional Cable TV HDTV Amplifier Splitter Signal Booster with Passive Return Path directly off the antenna. I now get 96-100% signal on 3 different TV's in the house. I have yet to see any freezes or issues with the picture quality. My work has 2 plasma TV's and wanted to show the Olympics but has no satellite or cable. Since I am in IT dept, my manager figured it was something I could handle. Thanks to messing around with stuff at home I was well versed.<br />I headed over to our local big bricks and mortar and purchased two antennas. Both costing $29.99 and both amplified. One by GE 34763 and other by RCA ANT1450BR. I wanted something sleek so it would not startle our employees as would huge rabbit ears. I attempted to get the antenna hooked up on both TV's at work and neither picked up the NBC station we needed. The RCA didn't get any channels at all, no matter how I placed or angled it.<br />The next day I brought in my Winegard Flatewave into work and rescanned for channels. It found over 30. For some reason I just was not surprised, LOL! Moral of the story this still one of the best antennas out there!<br />Good luck to you all and remember to use your resources like Antennaweb to do the research on the best antenna for your needs.p on both TV's at work and neither picked up the NBC station we needed.

1670,5,"The first radio I bought had the high frequency beeping the others had written about in the reviews.  I called Tivoli and the fixed the radio.  I use Tivioli radios with airport express' to wire my whole house for sound.  I have model 1,2 and 3 radios and I love them all but the model 10 seems to sound the best.  I prefer the model one for listening to the radio and I prefer the model 3 as an alarm clock but if you want something that works with a remote, the model 10 is the best."
1671,5,"Check out Dotz at your local office supply or computer store, and then buy it for less here. Nice item, nice colors (translucent). Will only hold put so much cord.  Will shorten a very long Mac cord, or completely wind up a very thin one. Will shorten toaster cords or electric toothbrush cords that are taking up too much space on your counters. Attractive, durable, Around 2 inches in diameter and 3/4 inch in height. Nice design. Helps some with  organization, but not perfect for that purpose - will need to purchase cord identification buttons, too if you have a lot of \\""stuff\\"". The Amazon Prime prices are good if you have free shipping. Check out the Dotz cord identifiers to use along with the cords wrap (winder case).  Less of a mess and falls hazard. Pretty if colors turn you on. A wise idea you want to be able to find what you own.  Still baffles me why people complain."
1672,5,"Great price on the glasses, my dog ate a pair of my glasses, really! Paid $80 for them. These were less than $50, work great. Fast delivery."
1673,3,Its alright. You have to shove it in your ear to get the full benefit out of it and can leave your ear hurting. Doesn't fall out of your ear but you constantly have to keep shoving it in there. It sounds good but you gotta shove it in there.
1674,5,"The switch has been working well for the past month or so; it is sturdy, easy to hook up and easy to use.  Much better than my old one that finally stopped switching."
1675,5,Item exactly as described. Works like a charm. I'll be buying more of these for my other rooms. Please don't waste your money on those expensive cables that do the exact same thing.
1676,4,"These were purchased after returning a pair of B&W MM-1 speakers to a local retail store.  The MM-1 sounded great, but what I had failed to notice in the store was the constant hissing (white noise) that they generated whenever powered on, regardless of source hook-up, even when no audio or USB input was connected.  This was not apparent in the noisier store environment but definitely was when in my quiet home office, where the sound was quite audible from near field listening distance. It was bothersome enough, especially coming from a $500 pair of computer speakers, that I returned them.  Finding plenty of other reviews online that complained of the same white noise issue, it seemed unlikely that my pair was defective or malfunctioning.  They otherwise sounded very good when music was playing at a loud enough volume to overcome the low level hiss.  Since I have owned the MM-1 and they are the closest 2.0 competitors the Focal XS Book speaker have in size, function, and price, there will be some comparisons in the following review.<br /><br />I need to mention:  What really disappointed me was that not a single 'professional' reviewer out there through my internet searches mentioned the audible hissing in the MM-1.  Or as it turned out, the Focal XS Book, though there are not many reviews out at this time, being fairly new.  So I'm putting up this long detailed review as a way of making a small contribution since I have read and benefitted from many great reviews here on Amazon.  Good detailed reviews are invaluable to me when researching a purchase, so I hope this helps anybody here who is thinking about buying these to make a better informed decision.<br /><br />After returning the MM-1, I ordered the Focal XS Book, which offers less in terms of connectivity (no USB / DAC input, no headphone jack, no remote), and figured that the simpler design might result in more emphasis on sound quality and hopefully less or no white noise.  Focal, like Bowers & Wilkins, is ahighly regarded company in the hifi and professional audio community and considered one of the best high-end loudspeaker manufacturers.  These aren't much cheaper than the MM-1 at $400, so I was hopeful.<br /><br />Well, they met my expectations for the most part, but they did have a couple of issues.  My breakdown of impressions:<br /><br />BUILD QUALITY / DESIGN:  4/5<br /><br />Plastic construction all around, but they have good weight for their size and appear from all angles to be very solidly built.  Plastic sides are silver colored (painted?) and the silver finish feels as though it would get scratched/scuffed easily.  Rubber feet underneath provide a nice upward tilt and keep them from sliding easily on a desk.  Removable speaker cover is nicely made and tight fitting, with an elegant silver Focal emblem near the bottom.  A white dot-shaped LED on the front of the right speaker shines dull/bright to show standby/power status.  The light is not annoyingly bright or distracting, at least not through the cloth speaker cover which kind of diffuses the light in a cool-looking way (the LED is located just above the right tweeter), and it is much nicer in my opinion than the annoyingly bright blue LEDs seen on a lot of other electronic devices these days.<br /><br />Power cable and audio input connectors are in a recessed area in the back at the bottom of the speaker, and seem to be solid and well placed.  Inputs include one set of RCA as well as a 3.5mm jack, and both cables types for these are provided in the box which is nice.  The audio cables are decent quality, are sheathed with what appears to be black techflex to give them a more upscale appearance.  Cable to connect the left and right speakers is not terribly long (about 4 feet I believe) and for wider positioning an male/end female end extension cable is also included (at least that is what I think it is for).  Not sure why they didn't just include a longer cable in the first place, but not a big deal.Different power adapters are included for European voltage, etc.  Unusual to find this, but Focal is French (though the XS book is made in China) and they apparently wanted to simplify packaging by adding all the power cable types in each.<br /><br />The power button is a \\""button wheel\\"" located on the top of the right speaker that is pushed in as a button for turning power on/off and it can also be rotated with the fingertips for volume control.  It feels well-made and has a nice rubbery feel, but it doesn't turn that easily because of the 'stepped' rotation, it does not freely spin.  There is enough resistance from the stepped rotation that I find myself having to use 2 fingertips to turn the wheel and it is very easy when adjusting volume to push down too hard and shut off the power.  The location of the button wheel is also not that great, since you have to reach up onto the top of the right speaker to adjust the volume.  Which means either getting up or leaning forward quite a bit in the desk depending on where you put the speakers.<br /><br />Very well made speakers, overall, but the button wheel was a very poor design choice, especially when the unit does not have a remote - while it is not exactly a critical flaw, it is still annoying enough to deduct a point (I'm almost temped to deduct 2), it otherwise would have been a 5/5 in this category.  It's baffling that they got so many things right on this but totally screwed up something as basic as the design of the power button and volume control.<br /><br />AESTHETICS / STYLE:  5/5<br /><br />They look very nice, and manage to look smaller (when seen from sitting at the desk) than they actually are thanks to the curved narrow shape.  Visually, these fit together perfectly with a Mac setup, and it would seem these were deliberately styled this way.  As said before, the elegant Focal emblem on the speaker covers is very classy looking.  The aesthetic elements on these speakers were very nicely executed, they lookclassy and unique and have a Apple/Mac elegance in the silver and black design.  Still, I think that few would probably guess that these are $400 computer speakers based on their looks alone.  To provide a comparison example, the MM-1 has an understated look as well, but being mostly stainless steel / black cloth exterior and almost no visible plastic, it on the other hand definitely looks expensive.<br /><br />SOUND CHARACTERISTICS / SOUND QUALITY:  4/5<br /><br />First thing that has to be mentioned is the white noise (hiss).  Like the MM-1, the Focal XS Book generates constant white noise when they are powered on, regardless of volume level, or whether any audio cables are plugged in or not.  It appears to be coming mostly from the tweeters.  To my ears it might be slightly quieter than the MM-1, but it is still there and from near field listening at the desk it is audible.  I seriously considered returning these also, but I then realized my options for a replacement were becoming limited, and for all I know all active / powered speakers are probably going to do this to some extent.  And I really don't want massive full-sized monitors on my medium sized desk, which is already cluttered with a DAC and several headphone amps.  My way of dealing with the white noise has been to spread the speakers further apart on the desk and create more distance from my ears.  Getting these even a few inches further away made the noise much less apparent.  Let me mention should anybody be wondering, that I do a lot of headphone listening, from the same source components (Mac mini and DAC), and I have never heard any electrical noise, hissing or white noise of any kind in my expensive and very revealing headphones, so I can confidently say that the white noise is not coming from anything but the amplifiers in the speakers themselves.<br /><br />Anyway - once the music is piped in and the sound comes out, these are just marvelous.  Sound improves after a few days of playing and driver break-in, so best to wait until at least 20 hours of play time have elapsed before doing any 'critical listening'.  The quality and texture of the sound, detail retrieval, and especially the low and tight bass for 4\\"" speakers, is really impressive.  I have to comment on the bass response Focal claims these possess:  It should be physically impossible for these to actually hit 50Hz with a 4\\"" driver, but with some kind of wizardry in the port design the Focals seem to do it - they definitely generate very nice bass.  I really like the bass ports being on the front of these also, they are unaffected by how far the wall behind them is, unlike rear ported speakers.  To be clear, these won't fool anybody with decent ears into thinking there's a subwoofer hidden somewhere, but they sound very good, bass is clear and full, and very tight.  I have listened to more than a few good recordings, watched Joe Bonamassa's Beacon Theater Blu-Ray, and you can clearly hear everything the bass player (Carmine Rojas) is doing, every little riff and run he plays is right there, and the sound overall is just great, super clean and no bass muddiness at all.  The MM-1 used DSP (digital sound processing) to do a pretty good job of providing better low-end extension from the tiny drivers those must have, but the bass rendering on the Focals is more natural sounding and superior in my opinion.  The sound quality in almost every respect is noticeably better on the Focals, in my opinion.  I've thrown every genre in my music collection at these, classical/orchestral, blues, instrumental acoustic, extremely fast metal, all sound excellent.<br /><br />For those who care - my rig/setup going into the Focals:  Mostly lossless files on a Mac mini (2.3GHz Core i5, 2011 model) played with Decibel software, run into a AMB Gamma2 DAC using optical, then RCA interconnects from the DAC's analog output into the Focals.<br /><br />Bass - Well, I basically described this already - bass is excellent.  Veryfull-sounding for a 4\\"" driver, is presented clear, tight, detailed.  No muddiness or 'boomy' sound.  Does not extend super low, but it enough to make bass and drums sound great.<br /><br />Midrange - Mids aren't emphasized but they certainly do not disappoint on these.  If I were to really analyze the midrange I would say it is delivered fairly neutral, will sound maybe just a hair recessed depending on the recording.  Vocals and guitars are very clear and have nice texture.  Midrange is transparent and not colored in any noticeable way, which is good.  On the Bonamassa concert I mentioned before, the guitars sounded great, while not being heavily emphasized in the mix during rhythm parts, you can always pick out chords, even when the keyboards are basically playing the same part.<br /><br />Treble - Is excellent as well.  Might be the strongest quality these have, actually.  These seem to have limitless treble extension, extremely clear and detailed with zero harshness or resulting fatigue when listening.  I am very impressed with the treble.<br /><br />Overall SQ impressions - Presentation is fairly balanced/neutral - bass, midrange and treble mesh very well.  The sound from the XS Book creates an immediate impression of being very precise and detailed, when listening it is effortless to separate the individual instruments especially on better recordings as I have already indicated.  By the way, I am assuming that anybody who spends $400 on computer speakers is not listening to 128kbps MP3 files.  :)<br /><br />Low volume listening is good, the L/R balance seems to stay equalized all the way down to the quietest levels, but unfortunately the hiss then starts becoming apparent also.  The MM-1 did a better job than the XS Book at keeping everything together at super low volume, probably thanks to the DSP.  But the Focal still does it pretty well, and the volume control is sensitive, allowing for very subtle 'stepped' volume adjustments which is good.<br /><br />Loudvolume listening is also not a problem, these can get very loud from near-field distance without breaking up, they'd easily fill a good-sized room up with sound and could definitely be used as a 2.0 system for a TV with very nice results, except that the lack of a remote means they'd have to be controlled from the source somehow.  The XS Book is not as limited to near-field listening as I felt the MM-1 was, it was not able to get nearly as loud as these can.<br /><br />Soundstage and imaging is really good, as good as can be expected for a desktop 2.0 system, I think.  Vocals appear to emanate from the 'center channel' between the speakers, even when they are placed fairly wide on the desk, and instruments are nicely spread out.  If you close your eyes and listen your ears do not 'hear' the 2 small speakers on the desk, they hear nicely spread out music.  My listening experience is mostly with a decent headphone system, and I do not feel that I am sacrificing anything when I choose to run my music through these instead.  They're that good.<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br /><br />The sound quality from these is truly outstanding, and I would not hesitate to give these 5 stars if it were not for the poorly implemented button-wheel design and the white noise.  To be fair on the issue of the white noise, all powered / active speaker systems apparently have it to a degree.  I had just hoped that for the pedigree and price of these (as well as the MM-1), that it would have been less audible from the sitting distance they're meant to be used from.  In both cases I can say that it is not an intrusive or bothersome sound, once you get a bit accustomed to it.  After all, some people even play low level white noise to fall asleep.  With more distant positioning from the ears it will likely not bother most people.  Once the music comes on, the white noise is completely forgotten.  I find these to have better overall sound quality than the B&W MM-1, though the onboard DAC and remote might arguably make that a better choice for some people.  But the real problem with the MM-1 was that you really have to be very close to the speakers to get optimal sound, with the Book XS you can mitigate the hissing quite a bit by moving them away without negatively effecting the imaging and sound stage, etc.<br /><br />That I am willing to live with the white noise and terrible power/volume button in a $400 pair of computer speakers should hopefully attest to the incredible sound quality the Focal XS Book delivers.  This is an excellent speaker system for a desktop or small room, and even with the faults I mentioned it is worth the fairly expensive asking price if small size, good looks, and most importantly sound quality are what you are after."
1677,2,"I have only used Creative players since 2004, and I was always very satisfied with their quality and user-friendliness. I needed a new player with at a least 30 gb, so I decided to purchase another Creative, despite the presence of some negative reviews.<br /><br />Well... I can only say that you should pay attention to the complaints described in several reviews because based on my personal experience I can verify that most the cons mentioned in reviews are true. I shall summarize the pros and cons, for this player, though I only used this player for music:<br /><br />pros:<br />-very good sound, just like other Creative players in the past.<br />-the device is light and small, which I liked.<br /><br />cons:<br />-very long startup time especially after the device was connected to the computer: you will have to wait 2-20 min before you can use the device. This was unacceptable for me.<br />-the interface is really clunky. The responsiveness of the touch buttons is really unreliable: 50% will give a respons to your finger tips. I found myself pressing the touch buttons repeatedly without any response.<br />-really slow loading times: every time when you change to another tab like albums or playlists it will take at least 5 seconds or more. It is unacceptable for me, that it could potentially take minutes to find a specific song.<br />-for me it was really a hussle to make my own playlists. It was not possible through Windows Media Player for me. Compared to my original Creative Zen vision M where you could create new playlists in seconds through Wind Media Player or even Creative Central/MediaSource etc.<br />-an ugly interface with a font that is too big, especially when going through tracklist.<br /><br />Overall, I was really disappointed with this player. I do not recommend this player to anyone despite the nice features it may possess because it is a device that is very difficult to use. I will return my player very soon and look for a new version of my previous player or something else."
1678,5,"AudioSource AMP-100 Modification to Prevent \\""Clicking\\""<br /><br />I have had an AudioSource AMP-100 amplifier for a couple of years and really like it. At this age, I no longer have a golden ear and can't testify that the audio is wonderful, but it is good enough for my 70\\"" Sharp TV, Apple Airplay, and Garage Band use. In addition, it is really well built and uses good components; It is a very conservative design both electrically and mechanically. The issue with this low-cost amplifier has been the \\""clicking\\"" that comes from a relay that transfers audio input priority. I have searched for a schematic diagram for years and AudioSource has not provided one and I don't blame them; Nothing good could happen by releasing documentation that allows users to modify the amplifier.<br /><br />Today, I couldn't stand it any longer and decided to modify the amplifier. I traced out the circuit - you don't need a schematic, you don't have to take off any wires, but you have to solder two connections. The modification will take about 30 minutes and you assume all risk. Here is my suggestion for work-flow: Unplug the power and take off the case top. Remove the screws from the rear that hold the printed wiring board with the audio input connectors and mode switches. Fish out the printed wiring board assembly. Place a towel over the amplifier so you don't drop any parts into it. Unsolder or cut off the 22mfd @ 16VDC capacitor C408. This integrates the audio signal into a comparator input made from ½ of a JRC 4558 Dual Amplifier. The voltage from the audio input eventually charges up C408. When there is a quiet section in the music, the voltage starts to fall. When C408 gets to about 0.6 volts, the comparator switches and the GS-HS-212T relay voltage goes from -10 or -11 volts back to zero and the relay de-activates, killing the audio output. I increased C408 from 22mfd to 1,000mfd using Radio Shack 272-1032. I put some heat-shrink tubing on the legs and bent over the capacitor against the printed wiring board so it would fit. Solder the capacitor verifying that the + lead of the capacitor is in the + hole silkscreened on the printed wiring board. The 272-1032 is really about 1/10 of an inch too big in diameter and you should try to use something a little smaller. My 272-1032 was rated at 35VDC and you only really need 16VDC so you should be able to get a smaller capacitor that will fit better. The time delay before music dropped out increased about 15 or 20 times which is working for me. You could increase C408 even further, extending a bigger capacitor into some vacant space near the heat sink or paralleling two smaller capacitors. Don't worry about stray noise, etc.; The circuit is not sensitive to interference. Enjoy"
1679,5,I hate ear buds and had a set like this once before until they broke.  I really like them and they stay tight behind your ears.  I recommend them!
1680,2,These headphones do not fit properly in my ears as a result the music sound very low and I can't even enjoy it properly while working out. The remote never worked with my mac i-shuffle as stated not even the volume controls worked. I think this was a waste of money for the purpose I bought it which was to use with the shuffle and for sports workouts.
1681,5,"going from no filtering to this filtering was perfect for my sub setup. running bridged mono with regular drivers this was a good choice for clearing up the bottom end, much tighter and cleaner bass now."
1682,5,"This item was a high quality cable.  I was expecting the kind of standard cable you get from Apple, but this cable was heavier and of a much better quality.  I'm glad I made this purchase.  It fit perfectly in my iPhone without having to remove the case from the phone.  Also the cable is long enough for me to move my phone around without jerking the cord out of the aux in accidently."
1683,5,No problems very happy and I don't have to br buying batteries all the time know. It arrived within a couple of days.
1684,5,"Amazing to listen to your favorite music, podcasts, audiobooks, etc while your head is completely underwater and 800m into a long swim.  Favorite present I've bought myself in a long while.  The best part is that it's an iPod and is reliable, works with what I already have and is incredibly easy to use."
1685,5,"Great speaker. Just what I wanted. I replaced a Jawbone - whose concept I loved - but the sound from this Bose is phenomenal. We use this speaker out by the pool, on the patio, and on the golf course. It's a little pricey but worth every penny."
1686,5,"Needed it for my Xbox 360. Ordered, plugged in it. Works like a charm. Don't be afraid to spend less."
1687,5,Like all amazon basic products that I've used these work really well. They're hybrid so they have great shelf life too.
1688,5,I would strongly recommend this for a decently priced clean hitting sub. wonderful product and superb quality for the price. The only con: I wish the amplifier had a little more balls.
1689,4,"If you're someone who loses earphones on a weekly basis, this is a pretty good buy. I'm not an audiophile. I really just need earphones when running."
1690,4,"I listen to mostly indie rock, indie pop, and some hip hop.  These earbuds sound pretty good for the price.  The highs are fine, mids are ok, and the bass is great.  I like music with a warmer sound. If you like music on the brighter side, look elsewhere.<br /><br />The only con I can give is that the cord is sorta tacky causing it to tangle more often.  I would have gone with a braided or a less rubbery cord.<br /><br />Overall, the earbuds are great especially at this pricing point."
1691,5,Bought this for my husband for his home office. It sounds good. It's not the $300-$500 iPod docks that are out ther but for the price it is a great product. My husband is VERY picky about his music and he is very happy with it.
1692,4,The product is working as expected.  It is a replacement for my lost Kindle power adapter and attachment. I would buy it again.<br />My only criticism is the amount of time it took to get it.
1693,5,I needed a way to hook up my old 1990's stereo surround (RCA style inputs) to my new HDTV and this item did the job.  I couldn't be happier with it.  Highly recommended.
1694,5,"THIS PRODUCT WORKS EXACTLY AS STATED. CLEANS COMPUTER AND SCREEN, VERY PLEASED WITH MY PURCHASE. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ITEM TO EVERYONE AND THE PRICE WAS A REAL BARGAIN- MAKD YOUR PURCHASE TODAY IF AT ALL.POSSIBLE!!"
1695,4,This is great for the price. The case has good and solid construction. The only complaint i have is the fact that the zippers go too far back when the case open. This makes it a bit hard to easily and quickly open/close the case.
1696,1,"I ended up returning the headphones in less than a month because the earclips regularly came off.  While it is possible to pop the earclips back on, it's frustrating to be stopping every five minutes during a run to make the adjustment.  I also found the headphones to be an uncomfortable fit -- perhaps I have unusually shaped ears.  The sound quality was great."
1697,5,"Bought these because I needed a pair of wirelss 'phones to keep harmony in the household. Easy to hook up to the TV and took about 5 seconds to get the frequency dialed in. The sound is excellent for the money spent, the inevitable RF hiss is quite low and tolerable (with the possible exception of listening to the very soft passages in classical music), and they are quite easy to hang back on their charging stand. Sennheiser is known for its quality products, and this one does not disappoint.<br />  There were a couple of reviews here that made me think twice about this purchase. I'm glad the individuals who wrote them were so completely off base. These headphones, while not audiophile quality, give an AWFUL lot of bang for the bucks.<br />  Range of the RF is perfectly acceptable for my listening environment....I haven't noticed ANY drop-off of signal while moving around the house and listening to them.<br />  About the only advice I'd offer Sennheiser is to make the clamping pressure on the head a TEENSY bit tighter, and alter the orientation of the ear cups to the headband for a better fit on the ears."
1698,5,"Got this for a xmast gift for my hubby, he loves it! I'm not crazy about it, but he is and thats what matters!"
1699,1,"This mount doesn't perform well with heavy TVs. The shipped screws broke and I had to go buy my own replacement hardware. This mount should work fine on smaller TVs. But for larger TVs, you need look for alternatives."
1700,5,"I got these for my birthday,  I really like these.  For the money,  they are a good value.  First off, I was hoping that these would fold up, sort of like the beats,  to where I could store them in a backpack,  But when they say folding, they mean the ear cups fold flat. But ignoring that,  these are great.  They are fairly compfortable,  after a few hours of use, they get a little uncomfortable,  as far as the other people complaining about how they hurt,  just adjust them a little bit. The ear cups are soft and fit over most of my ear. The headband adjusts pretty good (it has lots of notches)  they aren't too heavy,  they certainly aren't too heavy to walk around with.  they are built well.  They seem fairly durable, I haven't had any problems with the durability.  As far as the noise cancelling,  it works really well.  To better explain how it works,  You know that low rumbling noise that you hear in a car, when you \\""turn on\\"" the noise cancelling (by flipping the button) that low rumbling noise goes away. BUT,  the high pitched noises,  like squeaking noises and stuff, don't totally go away.  Basically,  the noise cancelling works by making like a high pitched SSSSSSSSSSSSSSS sound.  But the difference between having it on and having it off is HUGE!  Really,  I use these on the buss 4 days a week, both ways (there and back) and I really like them.  Overall, they cut out a lot of noise.  Let it be known that the noise cancelling works by using 2 AAA batteries.  They in a slot,  on the outside of the right and left earcups.  You can see the battery hatch on the earphones, where there is like a bulge.  To turn them on,  there is a button behind the right earcup.  this spot is really nice because you can find the button and know how to put them on.  As far as the other user saying the button was hard to turn on and off,  its a small matter of reaching behind your right ear and switching on/off a little switch.  There is a little light that glows red when it is on, soyou don't forget to turn it off.  By the way,  the batteries seem to last a long time,  I have used them constantly, and my battery tester says they are still fairly well charged.  I guess if you don't want to buy more batteries than you already do, get some rechargeable ones,  The headphones should be able to just plug into the wall and recharge by themselves.  But for $30,  you are getting a REALLY good buy.  I hardly doubt that you will find better quality noise cancelling headphones for less.  PS, the noise cancelling can be left off if you want, and when switching between on and off,  adjust your volume, because they get a lot louder when you turn them on."
1701,1,"The Sony S-544 falls short. After having purchased it, I discovered (among other things) that you can't delete songs from the player directly. You have to use windows or whatever program you used to copy the files on to the player. Also, you can't create \\""on-the-fly\\"" playlists directly from the player. You must create them using Windows Media Player 11. The real deal breaker is the non-existent podcast support. To this player, podcasts are non-distinguishable from your music files. If your player contains music and podcasts, it will play whatever is next in the rotation. When I'm listening to music, I don't want one of my podcast to play next unless I manually switch to a podcast. It doesn't even mention podcast in the user manual, so I doubt you can bookmark your place in a podcast.  The only good thing I can say about this player is that the sound quality is fantastic. I'm returning this model and dropping down to Sony's E series. On the E series, you can create bookmarked lists (similar to a playlist) directly from the player. Although with the E series you still can't delete music directly from the player, at least it has decent podcast support (and podcast can be deleted directly from the player). The E series players also have the SenseMe feature.  To sum it up, if you've already got a Sony E series player, don't look to the S series as an upgrade because it isn't. The E series has more features."
1702,4,"I like this. Good bass, clear sound. I only compared it with even cheaper options, but it blew those away. I don't know how it compares to the pricier name brands, but I have reason to believe it is comparable. It has a short built-in audio cable for optimal portability but also can take a long separate cable (or, of course, an extension -- but it actually includes a long cable as an option). I like that it has different lights to indicate charge status.<br /><br />Overall, I'm really pleased and surprised with the sound, especially the bass. The price is reasonable. I would recommend this over the cheaper options for people like me looking for the cheapest budget but not wanting crap."
1703,5,"For some time I had been looking for a well designed, solidly constructed and aesthetically appealing AV cabinet to house a large 90 lb Pass Labs stereo amp and associated gear and was about to have a custom cabinet made when I noticed this BDI piece. I took a chance because I have been impressed by BDI designs in the past and I am certainly glad I did. It is very, very solidly built, attractive and features extremely thoughtful and well hidden wire management and ventilation features. Importantly, it was simple to assemble (with help from a second person to lift because it is quite heavy) and it was also packaged to withstand a hurricane with large sheets of particle board underneath the cardboard box and surrounding the furniture to protect it from shipping damage. I rarely write reviews, but this BDI cabinet, though costly, is worth every penny and far cheaper than a comparable furniture grade, functional AV piece from other specialist manufacturers."
1704,5,"I own about 12 different pairs of in ear noise canceling phones, including top performing ones from Sure and Westone, etc and personally still like in ear a great deal for shorter periods and or when I want to block out commuting noise, etc.  However, I have always been a fan of Sennheiser and remember the first pair I owned over 30 years ago. I have had the PX 100-II for just a few days but feel they are an outstanding value for sound and ultimate comfort. The overall design is impressive and they do not stand out like many over the ear headphones.  I purchased the ones with the microphone for my i-phone use and that also works very well. For the price, these are simply terrific!"
1705,4,"Amazon Basics NiMH Low-Discharge Precharged Batteries, AAA and AA<br /><br />These cells are marked as being manufactured in September 2011. I truly appreciate Amazon going into different product venues, and I like their Amazon Basics packaging. It is simple, easy to open, and environmentally friendly. That said, I purchased these batteries based on several reviews raving about these being as good as Eneloops based on what a La Crosse charger told the user about its capacity.<br /><br />I bought a La Crosse BC-700 Alpha charger for this specific purpose, and as an engineer, I find the capacity to be somewhat misleading for most consumers. A high capacity NiMH cell tends to self-discharge at a faster rate (arbitrarily, about 1800 mAH or higher for AAs, and anything over about 600-700 mAH for AAAs). But it will handle the demands of high power devices better, which include flashlights, digital cameras, wireless headsets, etc... A lower capacity NiMH cell tends to self-discharge at a slower rate. I've tested and reviewed the Rayovac precharged batteries from Wal-Mart, and some Sanyo Eneloops I purchased from Amazon in 2010. Both of those brands had excellent quality and slow self-discharge (easily lasts 12 months) but the capacities aren't as high as some people like.<br /><br />The Amazon Basics precharged batteries are rated at 800 mAH for AAAs, and 2000 mAH for AAs. Using my La Crosse BC-700, I found this to be true with little deviation. However, I am here to review the self-discharge rate to better inform potential consumers. I used the BC-700 to fully charge each cell using a 200 mA charge current as recommended by Amazon. I waited until the next day to record the initial voltages.<br /><br />Out of the 16 cells I purchased, only 1 set of 4 AAAs was even close to 1.4 VDC (1.394 VDC) among all 4 cells in the pack. The other 12 cells were around 1.36-1.38 VDC. Over the course of 3 months, I took down voltages at regular intervals. I would later find out that I had 3 cells in particular that discharged at a much faster rate. This usually occurred with no-name inexpensive batteries I used to buy on eBay or other online venues. The Eneloops and Rayovacs all tended to remain uniform in discharge rates. At the end of 3 months, I found each Amazon Basics cell to be at least 0.03 VDC lower than the Rayovacs I was testing at the same time.<br /><br />Using a simple linear fit on the discharge graph I drew, It looks like the batteries will self-discharge, to a low enough voltage to warrant recharging, well before a year is up. Looking at the graph, all of the cells discharged rapidly during the first month, but then stabilized for another month, before discharging at a more rapid pace afterwards. There are 3 or 4 distinct discharge rates whereas the Rayovac only had 2 in  the same period of time.<br /><br />Initial Review: 18 FEB 2012<br /><br />Overall: 4/5 stars, I'd have to say the cell quality is spotty. I have 3 cells that discharging at a much more rapid pace than the other cells, and the battery voltages are never very high to begin with. Only time will tell with the performance of these cells.3 cells in particular that discharged at a much faster rate.

1706,5,the original hdmi cable had a problem. I  tried it on two different tvs and got very poor results. I sent a email to Eforcity and they sent a new cable the next day. the new cable worked fine.
1707,5,These headphones are great! I was a little skeptical bexuase of the reviews saying that they hurt your ears but they really don't. They do have a slightly weird feel and are a little large but not uncomfortable at all<br /><br />I use them at the gym and while studying and they are great! They cut out a lot of noise so you get a really nice crisp sound. The bass boost is awesome. I listen to a lot of dubstep and these headphones are the only ones that do any justice to the intense bass! So good! Highly recommended. I will buy these headphones again!<br /><br />The one issue with them is that the cord tangles easily and the word is a little short but usually it's not a problem since I use an armband at the gym.
1708,5,"This adapter was the exact thing i needed. It replaced my original, which mysteriously burned out, and i'm back up and running."
1709,5,"I had been looking for inner ear buds that didn't fall off while running, and these are perfect!  They sounds amazing look cool and don't hurt my ears."
1710,4,"Got this for my Kindle Fire's screen since I can't stand finger smudges. Works a lot better than the tissues I've been using! One or two swipes and the prints are gone.<br /><br />The only problem I have about this is the little pouch that came with it. Either I'm horrible at folding this thing back up, or the pouch included is a little too small. It's more or less a little plastic baggie. I can't get the cloth to fit in the pouch without folding it over awkwardly in the pouch or bunching it up."
1711,5,This was easy to set up and it works great on my satellite receiver and DVD/VCR player. All of my equipment is now tucked away in a rustico cabinet. Very happy with this purchase from Amazon.
1712,5,Love the vibrant colors and the earbud cord holder is a plus. 3 different sized earbud covers make it easy to customize. Have tried many. This pair seems to very durable.
1713,5,"I have this AC/DC adapter for several weeks now. I use it to power and charge up my Magellan GPS unit in my home. The GPS unit only came with a DC adapter so I had to leave it in the car to charge for many hours. This is not helpful when it is winter time and want to prevent car theft, and the GPS unit needs to be connected to Internet for updates. This AC/DC adapter allows me to keep the GPS unit powered and charged up in the house just fine. Now I don't have to worry about GPS unit dying from running down battery during updates, or running down car battery during Winter, or worry about car theft threat of GPS unit.  The price value for AC/DC adapter is excellent.  When pricing in stores it was easily 3 times more expensive in cost.  It's packaging is excellent - it has a red power LED to show it is working. I am very happy to have purchased this item."
1714,4,I received these headphones yesterday and I was surprise by the bass that came out. The sound is great and clear and the bass again I love it. Good product for the price
1715,2,"I both really love and really hate this product.  I have owned three of these and this review applies to all of them.  Pros.  supports .wma format so you can fit 2X as many songs as .mp3 with the same sound quality.  syncs with Windows media player- I hate Itunes.  I have all my stuff in WMP so I dont have to use another music software to make playlists.  Crazy small- this is probably the best thing about it.  Great for running or the gym- no bulky player strapped to your arm, in you pocket, or carried in hand (hate that).  I frequently clip it to my waistband to T-shirt.  Its so small and light I am always forgetting where I am wearing it- shirt, waistband, or which pocket.  Buttons!- I hate the touchscreen/ touchpad on devices- there are so hard to precisely control.  Affordable- The Ipod nano is about 3x the price.  Cons  Disposable. This is soooo disappointing but I have add endless problems with the 3 I have owned.  They freeze to turnoff suddenly with some frequency (though not all the time)- even after only 2 days of use.  The buttons are cheap. On one player the power button stopped working and then was pushed inside the device.  So I could not turn it on/off or reset it.  another had this happen to both the power and volume buttons.  While another had the screen die.  While I will admit that I use and somewhat abuse mp3 players- the three of these I own have been beyond flimsy- almost to the point of disposable.  Of the 3 I have owned 1 lasted 11 months, one about 6 monthes, and the last one about 2 months (although one of these was a replacement that SanDisk sent me through the warranty program).  All of them were new when I bought/acquired them."
1716,5,"I bought this for my girlfriend who sleeps like the dead!  This alarm clock can wake the dead!! She has not overslept since I bought it for her. The rumbler is great, it fits nicely between her boobs and wakes her every time!  Recommend it highly!!"
1717,5,This was a great cable for the price.  Purchased a Energy Sub and this cable enables it to produce great sound.
1718,5,"ok -- There is not much better than this.. seriously.  Portable, so you can put it where you are.. Smallish, so you can NOT take up a bunch of space which makes it easy for office, patio, kitchen and bedroom.  Good sound as well!  I was looking for this to be a more permanent fixture in the workshop at some point but I found the larger one.. better speakers and the portable one is sooooo nice for office and kitchen.. I think I'll get the larger one down the road.  Does anyone know if you can add speakers to this?"
1719,5,"After reading the reviews I was VERY hesitant to purchase this item. It arrived ontime and like previous reviews said, it arrived a box in a box. I opened it half expecting alot of them to be broken. To my suprise they all came in great condition from what Ive seen. I tried to open most of them to make sure, but none were crammed in the box and none of the plastic covers were misglued or disconnected. Once again I didnt inspect all 100, but thru at least half if not more, all have been in great condition. The actual dvd case isnt amazingly sturdy, but its the same as youd buy in a store, if you were purchasing blank dvd cases. There was no terrible smell that people were talking about. All in all, Im quite pleased to come across this on amazon :)"
1720,5,I needed a twenty-five foot cable and thought I would have to spend a small fortune. To my surprise I found this cable on amazon for a fraction of the cost that big stores want to charge you and the quality is  top notch... if you're in the market for a HDMI cable your search is over.
1721,5,"This is the traditional \\""old man fishing\\"" radio - You know, the kind of radio grandpa used to listen to the ballgames on or take fishing with him.  It gets terrific reception and is easy to use.  Very simple design and decent sound.  Perfect for camping, fishing, etc.  I use it to listen to my morning show on the radio.  I love am talk radio and this is perfect.  I actually ended up buying 4 of these and gave 2 to my kids and left the other 2 in my office and workshop.  I can't see how you can knock a $10 radio that functions this well.  For $10, you can afford to beat it up a little and really get to use it without worrying."
1722,5,What a buy! I have purchased a few things on amazon and i have never been disappointed once. This is an amazing product for the price. This  is a 10 inch sub that kicks like a 12. I have have had this for about 2 weeks now. I am using it with a receiver hooked up to the pre-out with the cable it came with. I am really big on music and movies. How the experience is when i watch or listen is important to me. For the longest time i went without a subwoofer and only had surround sound speakers. I knew something was missing so i got this for the fact that it was cheap and from reviews it sounds like it would be worth it. You get way more than you pay for.   Things you get:  Sony 10 inch subwoofer   100 watt amplifier(for other speakers not subs)  Cable that goes from preout to subwoofer  instructions  The dust cover is removable but not recommended   One feature that is good but can be a little bit irritating is the auto shutoff feature that can be set to auto or off. If your have it set to auto you must have a loud enough signal going into the sub for it to stay active.  If it is sat to off then the subwoofer will be in an always ready state.  If you need a subwoofer i say buy this one  feel free to Let me know what you think about the review.
1723,5,"Got the product within three days. New item, but did not come with any instructions. This was not a problem, just went to Dish.com and found extremely easy programming instrutions. Will use this vendor again."
1724,5,"Received IPOD as estimated by shipper.  Very easy to use, construct playlist.  Very happy with purchase.  I would recommend this to anyone wishing to have plenty of memory to store large music libraries."
1725,5,"For a long time, I have listened to my Sanyo 2033 amplifier. It was made in 1979, and honestly, the sound coming from it was ok, but if I turned it up to any \\""loud\\"" output level, the sound would become horribly distorted. I have never owned higher end equipment, but I am very good at distinguishing between good and bad sound. I would consider myself somewhat of an audiophile.  Eventually, I became so dissatisfied with it that I bought this amplifier. Wow! The sound is amazing. I noticed that the bass was tight and controlled, and the sound was powerful at high levels (without distortion). It was so powerful that the bass knocked a few things off of a shelf that I have mounted on the wall. The stereo imaging/separation was much better as well. I can now stand in front of my speakers and EXPERIENCE the music! I use this amplifier with Cerwin Vega VE-12 speakers, which I recommend. I am very satisfied with the sound quality and the features. There are plenty of inputs to choose from, and I just love having a remote to control it now, since I sometimes use it for \\""home theater\\"" purposes (movies and gaming), and the mute button is convenient sometimes.   The bottom line is that this is an outstanding receiver for an affordable price. The sound quality and features are fantastic. The only thing I'm really concerned with when buying any audio products is sound quality, which is the main purpose of buying a nice receiver. My only complaint about it is that the volume knob and the buttons on the receiver are somewhat flimsy, but that is typical nowadays. (What do you expect?) If you take good care of it, this shouldn't be a problem. If anything does break, there is a 2 year manufacturer warranty, so don't sweat it. If you need a new receiver and don't want to spend hundreds of extra dollars, buy this one. It's great, regardless of the price. I actually took my time to write this review because of how satisfied I am, and because I found the 1 and 2 star reviews to be a bit misleading. You won't regret buying this receiver!"
1726,5,I ordered 3 of these cables to extend my rear speakers on my surround sound setup. I haven't noticed any sound distortion at all. Yes theses aren't shielded however like I said in my setup they work perfectly.
1727,5,"This beats the hell out of best buy prices, it holds my 47\\"" perfectly on the wall. I would recommend this to anyone."
1728,5,"I'm not an audiophile but I just got an RCA 46\\"" TV that had really, really mediocre sound.  I had ordered a soundbar from a Black Friday Amazon deal, but that sound bar didn't have the right input from my TV - the RCA TV didn't have a TOS optical cable, just a coaxial HD sound cable.   This soundbar did have it, and the IR relay seemed to be a great feature so I could just place it in front of my TV.  Prime shipping was as swift as ever, and the setup was ridiculously easy.  True to form, I just left all the HDMI inputs plugged into my TV and connected a coaxial sound cable (also ordered via Prime, only a TOS cable comes with this soundbar, of course so does a power cable).    I'm not sure if I got the IR relay set up properly, as it seems to be working with my Harmony remote since I don't really use the native RCA TV remote.  However, it does respond when configured properly.  The sound quality really, really astounds me.  I know it's not a true 5.1 or 7.1 surround, but for the size, the bass is AMAZING and present without being too boomy.  It does allow you to hook up an external subwoofer if you so desire.  To be honest, though, I feel like this is darn nifty quality.  I don't really think it's a great surround system per se, but it is an amazing enhanced stereo device nonetheless.  My only major complaint is that Logitech's Harmony Remote software does NOT have a native entry for speakers, so it involved setting it up as an A/V receiver.  This is more an issue with Logitech, though, and has no bearing on the soundbar.  I am going to beg my wife to let me buy another for our other TV!"
1729,5,"I purchased this system in December and received between Christmas and New Years. Thus far I've watched several movies using this system and I'm totally satisfied.<br /><br />Movies tested:<br />(Star Trek: First Contact) via Blu-Ray<br />(Tron: Legacy) via Blu-Ray<br />(The Warriors Way) streamed via Netflix<br />(Star Trek Voyager, TV Series) streamed via Netflix<br />(Star Trek: Generations) via Blu-Ray<br />(The Last StarFighter) via Blu-Ray<br /><br />Pro's:<br /><br />*The sound is very full and fills the room!!!

(Recommended)<br /><br />Con's:<br /><br />*Price tag is a bit steep at $599.99. I bought refurbished for $450 from Amazon's seller network.<br />*Voices/dialogue are a bit hard to hear sometimes, so you need to turn up the volume.<br />*Not true surround sound. Although common sense should dictate a 2.1 system won't deliver true surround sound!<br /><br />I needed a sound system for a 42\\"" LED TV I bought for my upstairs bedroom office. The room is only 10' x 17' with the TV mounted on the wall. Lets just say this system is a bit overkill for such a small room...but that's just fine with me!<br /><br />The Bose Cinemate II could easily fill a much larger room with great sound! You also don't have to worry about running wires all over the place...it's only a 2.1 system. The speakers are small, minus the sub-woofer which is fairly large and bulky. You can buy wall mounts or stands for the speakers if needed via Amazon.<br /><br />If you don't mind the price tag....give it a try!"
1730,1,"Let me begin with saying I'm not a pro but I'm generally quite handy when it comes to building things and putting things together. And having diligently checked past reviews I felt very comfortable purchasing this mount.  That said, the mount I received is completely worthless. The instructions were nothing more than a parts list - and some of the printing was (no kidding) upside down AND backward. Not a big deal, but annoying nonetheless.   What IS a big deal is that there were only 3 of the 7 wall anchors that were supposed to be in the package. Of those three, only one was useable - the other two were too large for the bolt to even begin to thread. I found this out AFTER I'd gone to the local hardware store to get replacement and used the packaged ones as well. So it looks like I'm making yet another trip to the store later.  Adding insult to injury, I couldn't help but notice the price for this mount has dropped by $20 in the 5 days since it's been sitting in my living room waiting for me to have time to install - well, TRY to install it.  I am VERY DISAPPOINTED in this purchase.  Quick note... this is basement installation into block / mortar - not a wood installation - so I needed the anchors."
1731,4,"This distribution amp not only works to boost our Comcast CATV signals, but so far has worked flawlessly with our cable modem. Our previous setup had a 1-port signal booster (provided by Comcast) on the main cable drop that had to split to 7 cable outlets in the house (-10.5dB effective signal drop from the splitters which pretty much cancelled out the gain from the booster). The location with our cable modem had to then be shared with an HDTV and TiVo in the same room, so the signal was split even further. With the previous signal booster in the loop it would cause the cable modem to intermittently go off line which would kill both our internet and phone access. The Comcast tech then installed a tap to the main cable drop to give a dedicated unboosted signal going into the modem which then kept the modem consistently online, but the unamplified signal severely degraded the signal going into the HDTV and TiVo (plus the other output from the tap has additional dB loss which provided for a degraded main feed to the 1-port signal booster).  So what we needed was a multi-port signal booster that would be compatible working with our cable modem and so far this appears to have done the trick. This particular model has the bypass amp feature as well (on one dedicated MTA output for a modem), so in case power goes out to the amp the cable modem would still be operational.  Now we have dedicated boosted signals going into all 7 cable outlet as well, which in itself was an improvement in signal quality compared to the old setup. We no longer need the splitter tap for the modem which allows the main cable drop to go straight into the distribution amp.  The only gripe on this amp is that all the F-connector ports are designed to extend straight out from the facing rather than from the bottom side (e.g. like the Electroline EDA-FT08300). This amp was installed inside of a wallmount enclosure (with 3\\"" inside clearance) and the only way to close the enclosure box was to use right-angle F-connector adapters on all the ports. But this amp is reasonably priced and the $60+ differential with the Electroline amp was difficult to justify, plus the Electroline amp does not have the bypass amp feature like this one does. Other than that this product is working perfectly for our home setup."
1732,1,The audio is low and the Super Bass is not even an after thought The only good thing about this product is the additional headset. Don't even waste your time looking at this headset if you want quality sound. If you want ear muffs then consider it. THERE IS NO NYLON CHORD!!!!
1733,4,"I LOVE the sound coming out of my new Yamaha stereo. The sound truly is amazing for such a small system. It is well worth the money. My wife bought me the red, which I think is ok. At least she didn't get the pink! Really though, as long as SHE likes it then I am ok with it too since it is now in our kitchen/dining area and fills the area VERY well with great sound.  The only thing I would change is the ability to play and charge an external source other than apple crap. I have an android phone that this system will not recognize in the USB port, so I have to use the audio-in port. This still works fine and sounds great! But my phone is not charging while it plays. This really is minor, and the only thing I would change. If Yamaha ever does an update to allow me to play my android phone (Pandora) through the USB then I will give this unit 5 stars easily.  Edit: I have been playing with this stereo for 5 days now, and am still totally impressed. I have played pandora through my adroid phone multiple times on my new stereo, and this morning it has been going for 3+ hours. The sound is great and no problems at all! As I mentioned above, it won't charge my phone while it plays, but all other aspects are a complete home run!  Another reviewer said his stereo shuts off after 1 hour of playing through the audio-in port. Either that was a fluke or Yamaha fixed the issue, because I'm at 3 hours now and it is still going strong. Beautiful sound! I am already thinking of ways to save up and buy another for my bedroom."
1734,4,"I purchased these along with a Klipsch HD 500 5.1 system. They were on sale at $10 per pair so really it was a steal.<br />These units are sturdy and extremely easy to put together. They aren't the most beautiful things in the world but they look fine.<br />The speakers of the Klipsch are small so the mounts had no problem with them, I would think it would support any sizeable speaker but cubes or double cube style will work just fine.<br />Take your time to put them together and lock everything down (especially the base) before feeding the wires through and you'll be more than satisfied."
1735,3,"Bought as a replacement for a burnt out bulb in a Hitachi television. Took ten days to ship using the Super Saver, which was outside the stated time frame. When bulb installation was attempted, the housing would not fit properly. After about a half an hour of trying to make it lock in place, I decided to exchange the old, longer screws from the previous bulb since I thought that could be the problem. Sure enough, after a few more attempts, it was secured into place. At least the TV is now operational, hopefully for a long time."
1736,5,I bought 4 of this. works very good. The sound is very hight. I realy love and enjoy it. They have a range of 10 meters with the bluetooth. Very good
1737,5,"The Mediabridge - 16 Gauge Speaker Wire [w/ Sequential Foot Markings] - (100 Feet) delivers good audio quality, the cable has feet counter and it has truly 100ft long. Totally recomended. Thank You..."
1738,5,"Well made product with gold plated ends. The HDMI cable is connected from my EVGA GeForce GTX 560 Superclocked to my Vizio 55\\"" TV Class 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV, E552VL. I adjusted the resolution on my computer which allowed me to use all 55 inches on my TV."
1739,5,The user said that their staff loved them! They were very happy that the product arrived on time as advertised.  They are thinking of ordering more in the future!
1740,2,"dont bother-the cheap price isnt worth it in this case - just buy an industry standard instead - some time it works, and then it doesnt"
1741,5,"I've bought two pairs of these earbuds: one pair to keep by my bed and one pair to keep in my coat or backpack. They're great. I do have some higher-quality headphones that I keep by my computer, but these are definitely good enough for whatever I throw at them; and although they're durable enough to last a long time (e.g., strategically-reinforced sections of the cord), they're also cheap enough to be easy to replace. It's hard for me to imagine a better \\""sweet spot\\"" of price and performance. Also, the earbuds are a behind-the-ears design, which is FAR superior to the alternative. Major points there."
1742,1,"I was supposed to received my gold banana plugs on the 7th.  I called the manufacture to find out what was going on with my order.  He said that he didn't know but he'll find out for me, he put me on  hold for a few minutes, after been on hold for a long time he said  that he would have to check with UPS and that he would give me a call  in the next few hours. I still waiting for the call.  Awful customer service."
1743,3,"I bought this a year ago for the kitchen so we can listen to our pandora stations while cooking.  The setup was really simple - we were up and running in about 10 minutes.  The UI is also pretty simple and intuitive.  It's easy to select and change pandora stations, which we did often, matching the tunes to the mood.  However, the sound quality leaves a lot to be desired.  We're not even audiophiles, and yet the sound is muffled enough that after this one year, we couldn't take it anymore.  So we have retired the livio and replaced it with a Bose sounddock tied to one of our old iphones.  Now we have pandora and all our other programs, and it sounds great."
1744,5,"This product is super easy to install and superior in construction. After reading some of the reviews I thought this could some time to install. From the time I opened the box, it took less than 20 minutes to attach mount to wall and hang my TV. It works very smooth after making minor adjustments on the arms with the allen screws. I highly recommend this mount."
1745,5,"Finally some decent headphones and remote that stay in the ears, sound good and block some outside noise. Not much else to say. I have tries a few other sets and these were significantly better.  Also far better than stock apple buds."
1746,5,Retail stores cell HDMI cables at ridiculously high prices so I was pleasantly surprised to find this on Amazon.  I decided to use it for a few months before writing a review just make sure it holds up.  It is still working flawlessly and I couldn't be happier.  I will definitely buy again when needed.
1747,4,"My criteria for purchase was very simple:  1) a clock radio that had good quality sound and a remote- as I like to lie in bed before sleeping and listen to talk shows. 2) good reception for am as I am a bit far from the city. 3) no need for \\""i\\"" applications or any external devices. 4) an easy to read display.  I first purchased a Cambridge Sound Works i525 and was extremely pleased - that is until it failed 3 months out of warranty. Well, I thought that I would still like to have this radio but this time I bought a refurbished unit - which froze up the moment I tried to adjust the treble- so at this point I no longer wanted the radio and call CSW for a return. They agreed to send me a return shipping label but seem to have changed their mind and want me to pay and now are neglecting my em's and phone calls to date. I do, however, think that this matter will be resolved but I am a bit upset about their lack of follow up.  Next up is the Sangean WR2: of the three this is the best radio - pulling in my favorite am stations with no external antennae and it seems to be built better. Unfortunately, I missed several reviews about the the clock side: the clock side is horrible - being very complicated and the remote was of limited value. The death blow for this radio was the display itself which is almost impossible to read: it is so bright that it looks washed out.  So then, it was back to the drawing board: some units looked attractive but didn't have am - or they lacked a remote - or the price was out of my budget (low $100.00's). Reviews for this iHome 1A91 seemed very positive and the price was the lowest of these three so I ordered one hoping my quest was finally over.  The iA91 seems to be (so far) seems to be a very nice little unit: 1) the sound is quite good - about equal to the CSW but not like the Sangean- but then I didn't buy this to be my home stereo.  2) the large display is not quite as crisp as the i525 but very adequate - plus it gives the month, day which the others did not.  3) the i525 remote is the most fully featured of the three, but the iA91 is adequate. For example, each has 6 presets but the i525 has 6 separate keys whereas the iA91 has only one that must be pressed twice to scroll to the next station and you can't go backwards - an inconvenience but not a big one.  Of the three, the CSW i525 is the most fully featured and does everything well - with the exception of working for long. Maybe I just had bad luck but I did see another reviewer question the quality of the build."
1748,3,"I hate to think that my '3-star' rating might take away from what is an overall great product; however, as an iPod Touch (4G) user, the JVC XS-SR3J can be so darn frustrating that I cannot rate it any higher.  First of all, if you do order the JVC XS-SR3J then prepare yourself when the delivery guy hands you a small box, and obviously, the product's diminutive size.  Also, it's construction seems more on the 'fragile' side -- keep the cords away from pets & kids.  Straight to the point on why I think this product can be so frustrating: the bracket holding the sides of the iPod is not a good fit at all.  The unit comes with 3 individual bracket sizes, with the other 2 fitting my iPod Nano and iPhone just fine.  However, the 3rd bracket has the word 'Touch' printed on it (the other 2 do not need such signage as they are perfect fits) -- yeah, I can read between the lines, JVC... the bracket did not fit in your factory so you printed 'Touch' on it to convince us that the XS-SR3J is indeed also intended for the iPod Touch (4G).  The bracket's terrible fit is brutally evident when I turn to horizontal-mode... so many disconnects that I had to add little 'rubber dots' to the bracket in order to tighten the fit.  Look, if you have to \\""do something\\"" to a product yourself in order for it to work properly, then it is NOT a good product!  The worst consequence of the ill-fitting bracket is when I am relying on my iPod's alarm clock to sound, but the disconnection nullifies it... and yes, I have overslept a couple of times because of it!  Nothing will trouble your sleep more than having an unreliable alarm clock.  The actual product (when I'm not dealing with the bracket) is quite good.  There are a few glitches, but nothing as bad as the bracket -- basically, you'll figure out how to use yours eventually.  I purchased this product because I really wanted a docking speaker set where I can view my iPod vertically or horizontally -- there are not that many units out there that can do this; however, if you plan on using an iPod Touch then I highly recommend finding a different product than the JVC XS-SR3J -- even with my DIY-fix, its docking connection is still a frustrating event... so much so that sometimes I just want to throw the unit against the wall (which is saying a lot as I am considered to be an extremely patient person)!"
1749,4,I was looking for a charger and all the main retail stores wanted $70+ so I looked on Amazon and found this item. It was shipped in a timely manner and so far I have had no problems. The connection to the computer is great-fits like a glove!!
1750,1,"This is my second Archos and will be my last. Archos is a shoddy company that deserves to go out of business. My Internet Tablet 48 would not hold a charge. The touch screen was sluggish to respond. Only 500 of my songs synced from Windows Media Player. When I first called tech support about this very basic, no doubt ongoing problem, the woman put me on hold for five minutes and said I might be trying to sync file formats that can't be played on the Archos (I wasn't, they were all wma and mp3). She also said I had to update the archos media library, although there was nothing in the startup quide about this. (I udpated and it did nothing.) So I called back and got a man with a subtle \\""don't bother me\\"" attitude. He said I had to cut and paste all the songs to the music folder. There was a long pause. I pointed out that page 13 of the startup guide \\""Transfering Media to Your Archos\\"" said to sync using WMP 11 (which I had done) and there was nothing about \\""cut and paste\\"". He offered no more help. I copied the files manually, but none of the album art shows up. After spending several hours hunting through the useless on line help for the sync issue, I shipped the Archos back and will never touch Archos again."
1751,5,"These no-frills, over-the ear, wired headphones offer high-end, audiophile-quality performance at a fraction of the price of its competitors.  They're comfortable, and, more importantly, provide deep bass with no distortion. Sony has really scored with this product!"
1752,5,The actual switch is more glossy black and looks much better than in the picture above. Being able to switch with a remote is an important functionality for me since the devices connected to it are always on.
1753,2,"I was immediately impressed with the sound on these headphones; not only is the balance wonderful for a set of earbuds, they really do function beautifully as noise-cancellation headphones as well, if you use the properly sized ear pieces. However, I quickly discovered some major drawbacks, at least for my use of them: they do not work on my older generation iPod at all, and while they sound great when plugged into my older iMac computer, the inline remote does not work at all. There is no indication in the specs I've looked through as to why this might be the case; if you want to take a chance on them I recommend that you be prepared to have to return them if you don't have the most up-to-date technology to plug them in to."
1754,2,"I am disappointed with the Yuin Pk2 ear buds. Compared to stock iPod ear buds, the Pk2s are more detailed, have more pronounced upper-mids and trebles, but have little bass. I listen at low volumes, so with most earphones I have to amplify the bass. Boosting the bass does little with these. Overall, I find the Pk2s fatiguing, and they are my least favorite pair.    If the price were much lower ($20), I would rate these as slightly above average. They are not worth their current price.    I purchased Klipsch S4 in-ear phones at the same time.  While I find in-ear monitors uncomfortable, I am very happy with the sound quality of the Klipsch. I am still hoping to find a pair of ear buds that sound as good."
1755,5,"I bought this set of headphones back in 2007 from Target, and were by far the best headphones for the price (then $30). I recently lost them, so that eventually led me here, because I wanted the same model of headphones because they were so great.   I truly recommend these, especially for the price. They were great in 2007, and they're still great now!  The only problem would be that if you currently have newer style Sony replacement ear pieces, they will not work with these, these are the older style. You can still find them online, though."
1756,4,"This thing is freaking incredible.  Built like a tank to withstand any and all abuse, I picked this puppy up at an thrift shop in Billings, Montana for a song.  I generally purchase cassettes at truck stop cash registers,  so this Sony Sports WALKMAN AM/FM Cassette player is just the ticket for me.  Prior to owning this Sony Sports WALKMAN AM/FM Cassette player, I often recorded popular songs from the radio onto blank cassettes to listen to later or share with friends.  Now that I have a portable AM/FM radio, I find this practice archaic!  One of the other things that makes this so perfect is the heft.  Have you ever been running and for a split second wondered, \\""Wait, where is my iPod and/or Zune?  Did I lose it?\\""  With the Sony Sports WALKMAN AM/FM Cassette player, you'll NEVER wonder if you have it on you.  I find the clip on the back slightly too obtrusive in my waistband - to the point where it was causing some uncomfortable chaffing, so I've been looping it around my neck on an old pair of shoe laces.  That is also quite painful on a long or short run, but I'm the type that uses pain as a driving force.    Overall, I'd say this is the perfect portable music device."
1757,5,Have not used the ear buds too often as of yet but when used have found then to be as described. I like the fact it comes with different size plugs to choose the best fit. Sound is good. When used recently with my computer I found I had to turn the sound down for these ear-buds versus the ear-buds previously used. Carry case is nice quality and has pocket inside for extra plugs or anything else you might need to carry. I am glad I went with the more expensive product it was worth the price.
1758,5,"i thought when i opened it, it was going to be under powered but man does it make some noise i put in some other sony speakers spliced in for more highs the highs on the stock speakers are not so good but if its just for radio it works i use mine for more tv movies, n games all in all great little radio"
1759,5,"Beats any receiver that I have seen. Had Okyo,HK,Sny,Dnon...Hands down better than any of them straight from the box. I've fooled around with the Dnon AVR-5xx for 2 years and never adapted.  The VSX I honestly plugged in the wires, turned it on and selected the input and it worked all in less than an hour. My kids were playing Wii by the time I had started reading manuals from other units in the past. I questioned the price but when my hours and days worth of time spent with other brands(especially the Dnon, PoS) was considered...a welcomed trade off.  I loaded the Iphne App AV2, launched it, selected Receiver(out of BluRay or Rcvr) and it found the VSX within seconds. Very intuitive. I customized a input label for the Wii in less than a minute. I seen the microphone in the package that is used for the VSX to setup the sound automatically, but after setting back in the recliner with the Iphne App I realized the same could be accomplished through the Iphon Mic..Very Impressive Results. I assumed I would be using the Pioneer remote for mid to advanced programming features but I was able to set resolution(1080p,720) and accomplish the set-up all using the App."
1760,4,"I was looking for a compact AM FM radio alarm because I like to listen to an AM station and get all the news and traffic when I wake up.  This one is perfect.  Small, doesn't take up the whole dresser and easy to set with two alarm settings so I can have one set for the week and a different set for the weekend.  Good purchase."
1761,4,"My purchase experience purchasing from Amazon was excellent.  The item was as promised and delivered as promised.  I do have a problem, though.  I purchased a Seiko printer, batteries, and a battery charger.  They all came from different sources.  I cannot get the printer to work with my handheld Dell computer via infared.  It works with my older printer.  I was assured that the new printer would work with my handheld.  I'm sure that it is just a setting that needs to be changed, but I dont see it.  I have not had any success getting someone to help me.  Any suggestions, the printer and accessories is not doing me any good sitting on the shelf.  Thanks"
1762,5,"it is awesome sounds amazing, my acoustic with the amps, its like i have a hundred guitars doesn't make any noise, just have to change the input to built in input and you are set"
1763,1,I had to tear off the top rubber layer to make it work with an iPhone that has a case on it. Now I see they raised the price to twice as much as it was.
1764,1,"Winegard HD-1080 HDTV High Band VHF Antenna<br /><br />This antenna is go good. I order it and was hoping to have a nice antenna but I got trash. The directions are very hard to understand and once I get it mounted to my house I notice there is no antenna cable which you can connect to the antenna to the TV. This is not a wireless antenna and I think they are just wanting to get them off their stock. I have the wineguard ap-8275 pre-amp but there is no way to connector up to it and to the TV.  Well, I am requesting for a refund and I don't think I will every order here again. I am really piss for spending my time with this junk."
1765,1,"not very happy with purchase, cute clock, but only worked for 2 days, not sure why. Just had no power. nothing. very strange."
1766,3,"Not as comfortable as I want for exercise, but, they are 100% perfect at the desk.  I plug them into my computer and my phone and am hands free all day.  And there is nothing hanging on top of your head like other head sets."
1767,5,Inexpensive and works better than the Samsung ones!! Save your $$!! It's light and holds a charge longer than expected.
1768,2,"I purchased this so I could play xbox360 on my laptop screen. The picture is bad, and there is significant delay. Do not purchase this for playing games on your laptop."
1769,3,"After reading the reviews we hesitantly bought them to try them out. From the very first use we noticed the speakers could not handle any real bass, making the woofer pop constantly when listening to anything like Pop or Funk. We hooked the wireless receiver to everything from Satellite Radio to the TV to IPods, Droids - whatever we wanted in the back yard. Your not going to get Bose sound out of these. Remember, these are wireless, 900mhz speakers. So, every time a neighbors phone rings, it seems to ring in the speaker or block it out. After the first year of use, one of the input jacks for the electric adapter melted in the sun, which is when you find out these speakers are made like a tank. It took us an hour to removed the screws and got off sealant used before we could fix the plug. It eventually broke again. The second speaker, lasted a year longer and started cutting out. It would play for a few minutes, and then turn off. It sounds like another issue with the power, but we've given up.  The Pros - Easy to use - Just turn it on and it finds the signal. They have about a 100 foot range and once connected, stay connected to the source. The battery lasts about 7 hours or so of continuous play. They blend well into the landscape. Two of these will fill a 1/2 acre yard with decent sound and are great for parties.  The Cons - Not good bass response. They cut out with a cordless phone and sometimes require a manual switching of the channel. Speakers seem to die (as many have said) after a few years.  You get what you pay for. We are looking for the next set of speakers for our yard and may go with in the ground Bose speakers, hard wired."
1770,5,This is an incrediable program. I could actually tell a difference in my mood by the third day. By the second week people around me were noticing a difference. I was asked if I won the lottery since I was always walking around with a smile and a happy greeting.
1771,5,Cant be beat for the price.  Upgraded my Pioneer 60 watt subwoofer and as you can guess.....what a difference.  Music and movies pop now.  I have a 30x17 room that it is in and it shakes everything which is great for movies. My neighbors will love me.  I only use at about half power.  Smooth and distortion free.  Twelve inches....300 watts.....Polk Audio......200 bucks.  Nuff said.
1772,4,"Works as advertised.<br />I wish they would allow more room in between plugs, most devices that I want to connect have transformers which overlap the outlets provided so you can not use all the six outlets at the same time."
1773,5,I was having problems with my treadmill interfering with DSL connection. The DSL connection would drop out the second the treadmills motor was turned on. After doing some research I found out that the treadmill was introducing noise onto the power lines of the house and this was interfering with the DSL connection and also the wireless router. I plugged the treadmill into this surge protector and it fixed the problems. I can now use the internet for streaming audio while using the treadmill.
1774,5,"This is an amazing HDMI Cable, it's perfect for me. This cable is another quality built product from Mediabridge company. Highly recommended."
1775,1,Good product.<br />I got a used one.<br />Those *&(*#$<br />There were residues on the earpieces.<br />That's all I want to say.
1776,5,"Had purchased a cheap HDMI cable from monoprice recently but noticed that the highest resolution into my TV from blu-ray was 1080i.  I checked my settings, etc but the only piece of the equipment I could not be sure was my cheap HDMI cable so I decided to spend a little more and take a change with a mediabridge and I have not been disappointed.  Not only is my video now transmitting at 1080p but the sound into my receiver is noticeably crisp.  Overall, get product."
1777,5,"Purchased Dec. 2010, still perfect in Sept. 2011.  I \\""5 starred\\"" the software because: Very important tip:  Download RockBox, a complete replacement of the software and boot loader.  That is, if you find anything about the operation of the e270 lacking.  RockBox is SO full of added functionality!  Big pluses:  Themes, premade that you can easily download and install, to entirely change the look of the player.  Custom equalizers - that is HUGE!! You can tweak the sound to the nth degree, and save each one as your own custom setup.  It takes time to get it all right, but you can get it perfectly right.  RockBox exposes the real functionality of the e270!! Caution, it's not \\""supported\\"" officially by Sansa - but I'm at 9 months and it's great.  You CAN start up with the built in software, by holding down a button.  And RockBox is entirely removable also.  Pay attention to which \\""version\\"" of the e270 you get - I ended up with a version 1 - satisfied anyway, but I've read there's a slight advantage to the version 2 models.  I've had mine lockup a few times over many months.  Other reviews say to remove the battery.  Do not remove the battery, just HOLD DOWN the power button until the device resets.  That has happened so few times I consider it a non-issue.  User replaceable battery!  Yes!  SO many other players don't have that - once the battery can no longer hold a charge, the player is trash, unless you're good at soldering, and can find a compatible battery.  And there ARE accessories available - including a \\""wall wart\\"" recharger - I use mine all of the time.  Another tip:  the silicone cover is fantastic - it's not slippery at all, great for use while exercising.  The e270 interfaces well with a PC, choose the correct mode for USB.  I use MediaMonkey software, it's SO much better than others, and it won't get constantly \\""updated\\"" by Windows Updates.  It works with a e270 very well.  MediaMonkey too takes a bit of setup, but it's time and effort well spent."
1778,3,"I understand this is a portable and fairly cheap speaker, but it just does not sound as amazing as everyone says it is.  What I like about it is that it's convenient, I've actually been hooking up my iPod to the speaker in my car temporarily.  Depending on what type of surface it's put on or near, the sound changes (I have it popped out in \\""bass\\"" mode so it sounds a little better).<br /><br />There is significant loss of quality the louder you play your music.<br /><br />If you play it fairly low, it's okay.  It sounds like \\""cheap standard laptop speakers\\"" okay.  Warning if you listen to music with any high pitch (like a female vocalist who hits high notes) it sounds terrible.<br /><br />I rate this a three only because I like the concept and it's convenient.  However if someone wanted something portable for outdoors, for their laptop, or anything else I would say pick up some other speakers.  This doesn't really cut it for the price."
1779,3,"This is the second wall mount I have bought from Cheetah. I was happy with the first. The assembly is easy and uncomplicated. I spent extra time making sure the mount was level (never use the cheap level provided, use your own). Once I got the mount hung I realized the metal was not consistent across the top. It caused the tv to lean towards the right slightly. It is acceptable but indicative of bad craftsmanship. The second problem is the screws provided are way too long to fit into the LED tv due to the shallow sockets of the thinner tv. I have a Dremel and a nice cutoff wheel to shorten the screws. If you don't have the ability to shorten the screws (for LED tv) don't buy this mount. Lastly, the description states the mount will tilt 15 degrees and 25 degrees. Poor advertizing."
1780,5,"I don't hear the hard drive, just music and audio books ... etc.  Very fast sync, the cover art works great.  I love my IPod.  The only question to you all is black or silver?  I went for the silver and sort of wish I went black.  Enjoy !!!"
1781,5,"Sanyo eneloop is the inventor of the low self discharge rechargeable batteries. It certainly does not disappoint; in fact, it exceeded my expectation. I'm using the batteries for flashlight, mouse, game controllers and DSLR flash. I'm recharged the battery more than 50 times and I see no worn out in the battery life. So basically it is extremely good and will recommended it to everyone!"
1782,5,"I purchased two of these adapters to take with me to Korea and they work great. I love that I have two slots to plug into. Makes life very easy for me in my new apartment.     No issue, great price, quick shipping."
1783,5,"This note nothing about seller's service. I bought this swimmer's mp3 player for my wife. It delivered in good condition in late July. We tried this device during Labor day weekend, it can be charged, but can NOT be detected by PC's (Windows XP and Windows 7), I wrote this message just want a replacement, not refund or return.  (My wife just backed to US from a trip, so we delayed our test and missed the time to return it). I can not give high stars because we can not use this item at all.  Hope seller can read this message.  --------------  Update.  Vendor responded my note very quick and sent a replacement soon. The replacement works fine and sound is good. Thanks."
1784,4,"Bought this to mount an antenna to my roof.  It arrived and I was pleasantly surprised at the weight and strength of the main support.  Note that it does not come with the vertical pole, you'll need to get that separately.  It did come with long screws to mount it to the gable as well as the u-brackets & bolts to fasten your vertical pole to this mount."
1785,5,These headphones are nothing short of amazing! The experience you get is like a being in a night club. The price cannot be beat. You will not be dissappointed with how durable they feel or the sound quality. If you're looking at these headphones with consideration... BUY THEM!!!
1786,1,"I received this large clock for my mother who has Alzheimer's Disease. After plugging it in in her room, I noted that a very short time later, some of the parts of the digital numbers were already either burned out or fading in brightness while other sections remained bright and worked perfectly! I sent it right back. This was a big disappointment."
1787,4,"A bit costly .... but good product,....I used Apple headphone but this one is much better.Sound like you are in movie theater"
1788,5,"I chose these headphones for listening to music and podcasts on my phone (droid x).  Before these, I've just been using inexpensive earbuds and had no idea what I was missing.  I did comparisons of the Creative Aurvana and the ones I was using, San Disk brand, and the difference was really noticable.  The most obvious difference was the level of the volume.  With the Creative headphones,  I was able to listen with the volume turned down several notches from where I had to have it to listen to with my San Disk phones.  I think that's probably much better for our ears.  I listened to both music and a podcast and the sound was extremely good with both using the Creative phones.  I was shocked.<br /><br />I was also really impressed with the noise reduction with these phones.  I was able to hear what I was listening to perfectly fine with the TV on (since that's usually what's happening in my house when I want to listen to my own things.)  I was able to completely tune out the sound of the TV.  I was a little afraid to put the buds too far into my ear, but I'm sure if you put them all the way in, you'll hear absolutely nothing else at all.  They are very comfortable and stayed in even when I walked around.<br /><br />I was also really impressed with the accessories that come with the headphones.  It comes with a medium sized bud attached to the headphones, but there are 5 other sizes so you can have the perfect fit.  It comes with a little cleaning tool, a connector for when you are on an airplane, and the best part is the case you can carry them in.  It's a really nice design where place the buds in a spot just for them, wrap the cord around the center of the case and then velcro it closed.  It's all small enough to fit in your purse or pocket.<br /><br />I have to say I was a little shocked when I saw that they are $99.00.  I've never paid that much for headphones before, but like I said a the beginning of my review - there is definitely a difference from just your standard earbuds.  I did a search of other in ear headphones on Amazon and the price is definitely not out of line for nice headphones, though.  There were many in the $200 to $300 range, so I think the price is probably what you have to pay for something of this quality.search of other in ear headphones on Amazon and the price is definitely not out of line for nice headphones, though.

1789,5,"Buy at a local W-mart store, only $4.88. Why pay more?  Fits on my head. 8 lumen light. Bright enough to go for a walk, look around a dark garage. Hands are free. CR2032 batteries are fairly available. 10hour run time. Small enough to fit in a pocket. Don't have to wear it on your head, you can just hold. BUT it is designed to throw the light DOWNWARD. So the bulb is offset to do that. On/off button goes on right side of your head, or you will have the light shining on the ceiling!! Still, it does point up a little more than I would like. Have to tilt head a tad to be on something lower.    Very impressive for such a cheap light. Get one for camping or fishing, and then if you are caught coming back to camp in the dark, you can carry your gear with both hands and still have good light leading the way...    I recommend it."
1790,5,"I love this headphone for one reason. Working on a assembly line, I can't have any wires in my way. Don't care about not having perfect sound quality, although these are rated a 9.9 by me. Don't care about the weight, although these are very light. I'm just sad that the supply is shrinking. Must buy an extra set now before they run out. Same with the transmitter,Sony tmr-bt10a."
1791,5,"I had plain old rabbit ear antenna for my TV and got 5 channels.  After I bought this it pulled in all the local channels - about 25 in all.  I love how its flat, out of the way, and does not require adjusting.  Very happy with my purchase."
1792,4,The company sent all as it appears in the offer. no complaint about it. I recommend it widely. The only thing it´s a little scratch but its a little one. Very good.
1793,4,"The AA batteries arrived \\""pre-charged\\"" to about 85% of their full-charged capacity, about 1700 mAh.  After being fully charged the batteries measured about 2100 mAh when discharged at a 100 mA rate.  So Amazon's rating of 2000 mAh is accurate.  I used an Optim Engineering CBAIII to make these measurements (a chart is uploaded to user photos).  The batteries are a good value, but there are other AA rechargeable batteries on the market with significantly greater capacity."
1794,5,do you have a PC with bad sound?  Or do you have an iPhone/Mac and are having problems to get good sound quality on your studio headphones?    This product provides a super-clear and clean sound. All your music is suddenly brand new and feels relaxed and dynamic.
1795,5,"Looks are terrific, has all the features you could ask for, and it's priced right.  It's not so intuitive as to not need the instructions the first time you set it up, but it's easier than other clock radios I've used.  What more could you ask for?"
1796,3,I bought this Rhino battery from a different Amazon Marketplace dealer about 3 years ago.  It's a Made in China replacement for the APC RBC6 battery.  It just went bad on me - it was swollen so bad that it could not be removed from the UPS without using something to pry it out. It's also emitting a sulphuric smell.  Fortunately it's not leaking.  It worked well when it worked but I am only giving it 3 stars because it's lifespan is on the low end of it's life expectancy.  I don't think it's ever been fully discharged so I was expecting closer to 5 years.
1797,1,I bought this power supply for my brother as a replacement and it only lasted about 2 months.  Not recommended.
1798,5,"Quick delivery, a synch to set it up, mounted it in my garage attic. It's working great, pick up a lot more stations than the indoor model I purchased, crystal clear stations from the tv towers in Phoenix 40 miles away. You won't be dissatisfied with this antenna."
1799,1,"My husband got me the Kobo for Christmas because I read like crazy. At first I didn't really want an e-reader because I like to hold a book, but I quickly became enamored with the portability that allowed me to carry my books at all times and read anywhere. However, a few weeks ago, the screen started acting up for no reason. I looked online and found that many Kobo owners were having the exact same problem. I went to the Kobo tech support site and filed a claim and get a claim number, which you have to do to get assistance. After completing the request I got a response on the website that says \\""Awaiting assignment to a help desk operator.\\"" That was 11 days ago. I have heard nothing and cannot find a number to call them. That is unacceptable. The e-reader is wonderful but I recommend that you do research before buying one to make sure that, should you have a problem, customer service and support will be there to help you."
1800,3,"These speakers are not suitable for attaching to a tuner since they cause radio interference w/ AM reception.  Even after moving the speakers away from the tuner (and away from the antenna), I was still unable to mitigate the interference.  I did not encounter any problems w/  FM reception.   It's possible that the power supply that came w/ the  speakers is the cause of the interference and that simply replacing the power supply may correct the interference (not sure).      With the limited amount of listening I've done on FM I can say that they provide a good reproduction of music or at least music that doesn't have too much bass."
1801,3,"I would recommend buying another charger if you want this one. The charger worked perfect for about a month and then after that, you have to set the cord in the right position in order for it to work. Sometimes it takes me 5 minutes to jiggle the cord right for the green light on the charger to come on. It's quite annoying. It's good enough for now, but I'll be buying a new one here soon. The cord length is okay. I wish it was a bit longer but it's probably the same length as the orignial charger I once had."
1802,2,"If you know enough about technology to be dangerous, I would not recoend this product. I felt I had illegally rip content to get it onto this unit. Not willing to do that! Bought an iPod Touch...could not be happier. Know anyone who wants the walkman I have collecting dust?"
1803,1,This is the third VGA to RCA/S-Video cable I have gone through from this manufacturer. The first two failed completely and the third one worked for 30 seconds before failing. I would return the cable but it cost only $2USD so I can't justify the cost of shipping it back only to possibly get another non-functioning cable.
1804,5,"I searched the internet for a cover for my 50 inch plasma that I hung outside on my back porch.  This was the best priced Full body cover I found.  It is very well constructed with velcro and zippers which practically enclose the entire television.  Many of the others advertised only covered the front but left the back open to possible water/bug damage.  This cover is thick canvas and fully covers the front back and all sides.  While I use this item on my TV under my back patio, It could very easily be used in the open and protect a TV very well,  there is a velcro flap that closes off the wall mount opening if you are going to use it without the wall mount. GREAT ITEM."
1805,5,"These earphones are about the best I have ever used, great sound really comfort and it blocks out the backroud sound so I can relax!"
1806,4,"My only criticism of this well priced surge protector is that is has a very short cord. That said, it is very good for the cost."
1807,5,"I've had these earbuds for about a mouth now and haven't had any problems with them at all.  The come with 3 different sizes of ear pieces so you can change them depending on your preference or ear size.  They put out a crisp, clear sound and I really can't think of anything bad to write about them.  Maybe a clip to hook to your shirt so that they don't pull on your ears as much?  That would be the only thing I could think of because they're very nice for their price."
1808,4,I found this to be Very easy to set up. There are just a few simple stepsPlug in transmitter and insert batteries into speaker and you're done. Only complaint is possible distortion when you are inside and walking around. Have not experienced similar problem out of doors.
1809,2,"This was a bad purchase. I think they're too big for my ears, as I struggle to keep them on when I'm running, and when I do jam them in to stop them falling out, the big, uncomfortable earbuds really hurt!"
1810,4,"I've heard good things about the Tecsun radios... almost sprung for another brand and I was glad I decided on this one instead.    Pros:  - Excellent reception on AM, FM and shortwave bands, with great sensitivity and selectivity  - Doubles as a portable speaker (handy for MP3 players, CD players, cassette, etc.)  - Can be powered/charged via USB  - Selectable AM bandwidth (6, 4, 3, 2, 1 kHz) for listening to more distant stations and reducing noise  - Manual covers everything well  - Includes earphones and a shortwave antenna, as well as a nice travel case  - Excellent sound    Cons:  - No C-QUAM AM stereo reception  - No single-sideband option for shortwave    Comparing this with my old shortwave radio, I think this one has the better features (I cannot test longwave as there are no longwave stations in North America however)."
1811,5,"It works perfect. I bought two. One for my Samsung Bordeaux 23 with my xbox 360 (720p-1080i) and the image quality is the same as other HDMI cable like monster, belkin or the Microsoft cable which used to come with the xbox 360 elite. Maybe the other cables are a little bit better but actually you don't notice the difference. The other one is with the new Bravia FullHD 55 led 3D and I connected to my BluRay and the quality is awesome. It has nothing to envy to the big brands that charge you 50,60,70.. or even 100 bucks for the same cable that I paid 2.11$ each avoiding tax and shipping. Also I used the free shipping that is suppose  to deliver in 7-10 business day and I got it in 3 from CA to FL! 100% recommended!"
1812,5,I received the item as advertised. It works great. Got it in just a few days after ordering it.  Was really pleased with this purchase.  Would buy from them again. Have told all my friends about it.
1813,5,"Works as advertised. I realize some people have had problems with 3rd party cables with Apple products, but I've used this cable with 6 different TVs and have had no problems whatsoever.    Cable was delivered on-time as promised and packaged to arrive safely."
1814,3,less expensive than could buy locally. as irritating as expected. thats noaa's fault i guess not the radio's. only got this warning radio after being nagged by friend. you are not going to avoid a tornado.
1815,5,"I decided to put a tv outside - and needed a way to keep it covered from the elements.   Though its a 42\\"", and says that it fits 36\\"", 37\\"", and 40\\"", note that the cover will look a bit \\""fat\\"" or weird. I have a 37\\"" and it works, does the job, but thats my only little complaint.    If you don't care about that, and just need a great cover to keep your tv covered, this thing does the job well."
1816,5,This unit works great. Very easy to install and set-up.  I really like the easy menu options that make it easy to adjust the brightness and contrast of the image.  Would totally recommend.
1817,1,"I purchased two Tivoli Model Two Stereos brand new. We were initially thrilled with the purchase. As others have reported, they sound great and they look wonderful in our modern decorating scheme. However, after about two years, both units ceased to produce any sound to the ancillary (stereo) speaker when using the stereo with an external source. I love the look of these stereos, and when they work, they sound great. But I cannot recommend this model given the unreliability that I've experienced. This is very disappointing given the price of these speakers. Reliability should not be an issue."
1818,5,"I've put the Woodees IESW100L BLUES through their paces on rock, blues, grunge, rap, metal, folk, country, classical, and a lot of stuff that resides in-between the genres, and I'm thrilled with the purchase.    They especially shine on acoustic guitar tracks. Listening to Jeff Buckley's Lilac Wine through these headphones blew me away because I could hear more of his acoustic guitar's sound than I realized was captured by the recording.    I blogged my full review at: [...]"
1819,4,"i have the j3 microbuds that i hadnt bought that long ago, so i was kinda psyched that they actually worked so that i didnt have to replace these for working out or just whatever. when you first get them they are a little snug trying to get the cord in, but not that bad. totally worth it, and for the price you cant really go wrong if you need something like this. someone did say something about not working that well on a flat cord, mine is a round cord...fyi."
1820,5,"Im writing this as more of a question and not a review. I see some people have said the cable lasted \\""x\\"" amount of time. HOW does a cable just go out? its not electronic..Its just wires. How does it just go out? Ive never had a cable just quit working. Im thinking of buying this cable but im a tad on the edge with it.."
1821,4,It may have been my own lack of understanding but the cable is not supposed to convert video from your computer (VGA) to RCA out but quite the opposite. You can go from a RCA input and use the VGA as the output and it seemed to work. Not sure if I said it all correctly but i do know when I was trying to push a signal through the VGA from my computer out to the RCA I had some weird things happening to the screen
1822,5,Excellent modulator- I bought it as refurbished and it is better than new. Excellent product from an excellent merchant    Thanks
1823,5,"I purchased this cable to go with the new LG BD 370 blu-ray player that I purchased from Amazon as well. The HDMI cable was a gift to my parents after they purchased a new LCD television. I am not qualified to rate this cable from a technical perspective, but I can say that after I hooked up the cord to the television and blu-ray player the effect was prime! Everything worked without a glitch and the television picture looked great! I could not help but purchase this HDMI cable, as all the reviews on it were great! I believe that you will not be disappointed with this cord in any way!"
1824,5,Harman Kardon makes a great product for the average joe non audio-file. I bought this AVR to upgrade my system along with the new 3D TV and blu-ray. The hook up was very easy as was the set up. Great on screen menu. I have all of my components running through the AVR and one HDMI cable to the TV. The only issues I have with the AVR is that renaming the source is a little tough and you have to have the Bridge adapter to hook up your ipod/iphone to the AVR. Over all this unit performs as expected and sounds great.
1825,5,"This is a really nice product and works well for smaller cell phones, but will not work on an HTC Sprint EVO."
1826,4,"I am happy with this product.  The speakers are pretty good and the player itself is pretty easy to use.  Creative Centrale, the online library to store all your songs, though has a lot to be desired as it kept crashing on me so I ended up using Real Player.  I was surprised how small this player was."
1827,5,"This was a great purchase!!  Excellent sound-from The Clash to Sinatra-everything sounds fantastic! Was worried from other reviews that would need sub-woofer but I just engaged the Super Base feature, adjusted base to +3 and treble to +1 and this stereo rocks-with volume at 28 I worry about the neighbors and the volume goes up to 50...Also, hooked DVD player audio up to it and now movies play in stereo (I turn off Super Base for movies)-way better than TV speakers and no need to have five surround sound speakers all over the place-wonderful!!  Cannot believe how great it sounds and all it does for under $200 & outside seller included free shipping-highly recommend!"
1828,5,"This product has amazing sound for its size! I can't believe how crisp and clear it is. Not a lot of base, but you can't get great base out of something so small.    Amazing product. I highly recommend it!"
1829,5,"I design headphones on etsy, and in the beginning I had a really hard time finding headphones to make because a lot of them would short out for no reason.  I've used these for months now and literally but them through all kinds of abuse, another pair would've shorted but these didn't. They have a amazing sound, and they're cute.  The only possible problem could be that in the beginning, like most headphones, they're a little tight around your head, but once you wear them more they'll start to stretch out more. (I leave them on a box so they stretch out before I design them and sell them.) I would definitely recommend."
1830,2,"Product arrived quickly and is very nice looking, unfortunately, it doesn't seem to do anything.  I cannot see any difference at all since installing.  Had hoped to improve reception on 2 HD cable channels that break-up frequently.  No luck, maybe it is not meant for that."
1831,1,I bought this from Amazon because the Sony Bravia TV I bought recently had very bad sound.  Sound sounded like it was coming from a tin can.  Well this speaker system certainy changed that.  Now the sound is muffled and voices sound like they are spoken into a pillow.  The various settings on the remote offer no help.  Treble & subwoofer controls provide very limited control.  The subwoofer doesn't really provide any bass tones.  It simply muffles the sound - like one is holding a pillow over the speaker.  I am sending this unit back after only 3 hours of ownership.  It's quite literally a piece if junk and worth no where near the $350 I spent on it.
1832,5,"They're nice and soooo stylish, and provide excellent sound!   I used to be bothered by my rommie's phone calls all the time, but these headphones actually do block outside sounds pretty well. So glad I got these. Always catch compliments~"
1833,4,"Purchased to compliment the new HDTV in my bedroom. Ideal for watching movies at night. Wireless is a Godsend. Very clear sound, very happy.     My one complaint: Sennheiser includes a stand with the 170 & 180 models but not this one, the 160. Feels like a cheap move on their part. You will need a stand of some sort in my opinion. Otherwise looks cheap just laying them on a table. I ended up buying a banana stand from a local retailer and they hang from there. I think Sennheiser should have included some sort of stand. Even if it was made of cheap materials.     I also recommend you purchase a set of 4 AAA rechargeable batteries and a charger. You get 2 rechargeable batteries with the headphones. It's a pain to charge the batteries using the headphones and adapter. Just buy stand alone batteries and life will be a lot easier when you run out of juice (keep 2 AAA batteries charged as a backup at all times)."
1834,5,"These HDMI cables are fabulous! They work fantastically!  When I purchased my new 565\\"" TV set I wanted to stream movies from my PC  to the TV.    I priced the same HDMI cables at Best Buy and PC Richards.     HOLY COW - PC Richards charges $168 for their 15 foot cables.  Leaping Lizzards - Best Buy charges almost as much.    These HDMI cables only cost me $15 on Amazon.  Why pay ridiculous prices at retail???    THANK YOU AMAZON!!!"
1835,4,"This item is recommended for a 52\\"" or smaller TV but my 55\\"" Philips fits beautifully on it with about an inch overhang on each side.  The tapered sides make this unit perfect for slipping back into a corner which was one of the selling points for me.  Underneath on the top shelf, I have a full sized home theater receiver, cable box, and center channel surround speaker, and on the bottom shelf, an old-school turntable and DVD/VHS(Yes VHS)combo.  With a slimmer, more modern DVD player, you could easily stack two additional components on this unit.  It must have been easy to put together, as my son had it finished by the time I got home from work.  This stand is reasonably priced, with an uncluttered, contemporary look, that, as other reviewers have described, looks more expensive than it is."
1836,2,"I've had a Sansa clip for almost 2 years now and LOVE the clip feature since I use it while working out and hate using armbands. I can clip it anywhere I want and it stays in place great.     I don't do anything extra with this players, so I can't comment on how good or how bad some of the features are. I simply download MP3's from my collection on WM Player and go to the gym, turn it on and play. That is it. I listen to the volume just short of full volume and it is sufficient and with it up that loud the battery will typically last around 6 hours or a little more without having to charge it up.     My problem is that it is one of the most unreliable pieces of electronic equipment I have ever owned in my entire life. I purchased it from an electronics store with a 2yr protection plan, thank goodness I opted for the 2yr plan. I have literally had to take it in for replacement half a dozen times now. I'm on my 6th one and I just recharged it and now it is completely frozen with the power on and the screen lit up. Will not respond to anything I do including the power button. This is the third unit I have had with this problem. 2 other units would occasionally erase all my files. I would turn on the power and no music would be available even though I had just used it the previous day with over 300 songs on it.     I have no idea why I keep getting duds, but the longest I have had one last so far is 10 months. That was the first one. The rest of them have lasted around 2 months. I do not get them sweaty or wet during a workout, so I have no idea why they do not hold up.     It is really a shame as overall I like the player as it is small, convenient,and does what I need. The problem is total lack of reliability. Will have to look for a new brand now as a replacement as my 2yr protection plan on it is almost expired."
1837,5,"These Skullcandy Skullcrushers headphones are the best that I've found for BASS... I feel the BASS, not just hear it... Skullcrushers specialize in BASS... If your looking for other high end Audiophile frequencies then you might not like them... If your looking for BASS and more BASS on top of BASS then your in for a amplified sub-woofer treat where you feel the lows."
1838,5,"i got a sweet, and this product is much better than i think. go get it for your netbook, 10- 11 inches will do."
1839,5,"I just received my clock radio with CD and IPOD station.  I have to say, \\""I love it so far\\"". The sound quality is pretty good for a bedroom clock radio. I love the way you can awake to the songs on your IPOD or CD. It was very easy to get everything up and running. If I can do it, anyone can, lol... The only downfall is that it doesn't pick up my favorate radio stations. I don't think the availability of the radio is very powerful, but you do get a nice selection with FM or AM. Overall, it is definitely worth the money."
1840,5,"I purchased this 25ft cable to run to a ceiling mounted hd projector. The picture is great. Bluerigger also shipped the next business day after my order. A similar cable would cost me $100 at a retail store. There is no reason to pay more. Hdmi is a digital signal, you will not see a difference between this and a higher end cable. It is a nice solid cable and has very nice terminals and shielding. I will look to blue rigger for my future cable needs for sure , 100% recommend them"
1841,5,"Well, I received the FMJ as a christmas gift. I got the older version - S2FMBZ-BZ. They sounded great, on the other hand I bought skullcandy TiTan, too. They arrived on the same day, I compared them; TiTan has better bass, FMJ has better treble. After 1 day, My FMJ broke, I contacted skullcandy to get a replacement. They sent me a latest FMJ. It sounded good, it's good at isolating sounds. The only problems were.. they changed the wiring, the older version is nylon braided, the new version is rubber and you get shock when it gets cold. It's a good earbuds, the mic/next/previous works fine on iPod touch 2g/4g and iPhone as well."
1842,4,"Nice budget cable for connecting audio devices. Having used dozens of these types of cables, I suspect it won't stand up to heavy use but, at this price, it is painless enough to replace.<br /><br />- Good flexibility<br />- Nice length<br />- Thinner than other typical cables of this type which could impact lengevity<br />- It works<br /><br />P.S. - Still working well after over a year of light use -- adding another star to rating."
1843,5,"This is a sturdy little adapter for going from an F-type (my cable TV connection) to an RCA type (my DVD/VCR).  Simple to install, easy to use, difficult to damage."
1844,3,"This switch works very well for all of it's intended functions.  The Optical and Coax digital out work flawlessy with my DVR, my Xbox and my Bluray player.  One problem I have is that when switching away from my DVR input (dish 922) and then switching back later the TV (LG 65 LCD) loses the connection.  The only way to fix it is to reset the switch and let it renegotiate the connection.  I don't know if this is a problem with the switch or with the DVR.  The other problem is the lights on the front are WAY too bright.  There's really no need to see those lights at all much less from two houses down.  If you plan to take a nap on the couch make sure to bring an extra blanket to cover your switch :)"
1845,5,"I bought a 16Gb Zen Mozaic for listening bible, workshops, books, and music off course. I also play children's music in my sunday school classroom -- better than CD player because I can dance and jump with it, and repeat or pause without leave my circle of children. I really love this player and I use it everyday. Unfortunately, I left my original one at my parent's house far away. I feel like this great little player is an important part of my life and can't live without it. So I decided to purchase this re-furbished 4GB player as a relacement before I can get my original back in 4 months. The quality of this refurbished one is comparable with my original one. Very good sound quality, long lasting battery life, and user friendsly bottons."
1846,5,"I was looking for a replacement subwoofer amplifier for a 12\\"" KLH I've had for several years whose amplifier failed a year or two ago.  I had only paid $120 new for the KLH at Sams Club and had located this replacement amp over a year ago - but at $129 it just didn't seem worth the money to fix the KLH - kind of like throwing good money after bad.  But I had purchased other parts from this vendor in the past and I knew them to be reliable.  So I finally saw a price drop to $99 and, while still higher than I wanted to pay, I really wanted the 12\\"" air movement back.  I was using an older 10\\"" in my home theater and it just didn't have the same oomph!<br /><br />For any of you that have the same KLH 12\\"" subwoofer I can now attest to this being a perfect drop-in replacement - even the mounting screw holes are exactly the same!  But I think this amplifier is more powerful, has more usable features, and is apparently better made generally.  It has functioned perfectly for over a month now.<br /><br />It looks very similar to the amplifier supplied by KLH and is probably made by the same manufacturer based on fit and finish but has more features that actually work.  The old amplifier had problems with its automatic on/off detection, an important function if your subwoofer is buried behind a mountain of video gear.  The old unit would sometimes stay on for hours after the rest of the system was shut down.  This new unit shuts down promptly as soon as the receiver is shut down.  That saves electricity and may keep some of the circuitry from aging too quickly when not in use.<br /><br />The unit is offered in two versions, with and without a boost option.  It's not clear to me what the difference actually is as the pictures are identical and there is no separate control for \\""boost.\\""  I thought I had ordered the \\""no boost\\"" version but my order confirmed by Amazon came through saying the boost version.  Believing that any difference could probably be handled by the sensitivity and rolloff controls I decided to wait and see how it actually performed - if the bass came out muddy because of the boost I'd return it for the other model.  I've dealt with this vendor before and their customer service has been reliable and helpful.<br /><br />The product arrived on time and in perfect condition.  The unit was clearly heavier than the original amplifier it was replacing, raising my hopes for even better performance.  The lip of the mounting surface had the same foam tape sealant that the factory original had, guaranteeing a tight seal and, as I mentioned, the screw holes lined up identically.  If you have a similar setup, a subwoofer amplifier that measures approximately the same as this unit, and were wondering how perfect the fit might be, I can tell you that despite my measurements being different than the published dimensions by as much as .25\\"" the unit fit perfectly!<br /><br />The total installation time was on the order of 15 minutes, including some time spent wrapping the speaker leads with insulation to avoid rattling and verifying the tightness of all exposed screwheads.  Subwoofers vibrate a lot in operation - that's what you buy them for - but you want the vibration to be from the soundtrack and not loose parts!<br /><br />Performance has been excellent.  My fears about the boost option making the sound muddy were not fulfilled.  The subwoofer now sounds full, deep, and crisp - only took about 5 minutes to get a good sensitivity level set using sound samples from a Maxell Blu-Ray Lens Cleaner disk (a very useful product itself! see [[ASIN:B00178HN0O Maxell BR-LC Blu-ray Lens Cleaner]]).  It's clearly a step up from the unit is was replacing.<br /><br />Good Product, Perfect fit - and a reasonable value!cided to wait and see how it actually performed - if the bass came out muddy because of the boost I'd return it for the other model.  I've dealt with this vendor before and their customer service has been reliable and helpful.    The product arrived on time and in perfect condition.

The lip of the mounting surface had the same foam tape sealant that the factory original had, guaranteeing a tight seal and, as I mentioned, the screw holes lined up identically.  If you have a similar setup, a subwoofer amplifier that measures approximately the same as this unit, and were wondering how perfect the fit might be, I can tell you that despite my measurements being different than the published dimensions by as much as .25\\"" the unit fit perfectly!      The total installation time was on the order of 15 minutes, including some time spent wrapping the speaker leads with insulation to avoid rattling and verifying the tightness of all exposed screwheads.  Subwoofers vibrate a lot in operation - that's what you buy them for - but you want the vibration to be from the soundtrack and not loose parts!    Performance has been excellent.  My fears about the boost option making the sound muddy were not fulfilled.  The subwoofer now sounds full, deep, and crisp - only took about 5 minutes to get a good sensitivity level set using sound samples from a Maxell Blu-Ray Lens Cleaner disk (a very useful product itself! see [[ASIN:B00178HN0O Maxell BR-LC Blu-ray Lens Cleaner]]).  It's clearly a step up from the unit is was replacing.    Good Product, Perfect fit - and a reasonable value!"
1847,5,"Great Headphones for TV.  Plug into recharger at end of day, no problem with battery life. (I also have an external charger for two removable AAA). The range is about 50ft if you go into other rooms, but ok for me.  Sound quality good. Volume level adjustment great.  Has volume adjustment on transmitter and on headphones. Very lightweight. I highly recommend these headphones."
1848,1,"I bought this adaptor to connect my Sony PS3 to an LCD computer monitor with an HDMI cable.  Although the monitor will detect a signal nothing shows on the screen.  The adaptor does, however, work if you connect a computer to a monitor."
1849,1,"I purchased this clock radio in 2008, and have loved it for the ease of set up and use and the wonderful wall/ceiling projection feature. The radio, however, was of terrible quality, having cheap, tinny sound and a weak tuner that could hardly pull in any stations in this New  York City suburb. Its pluses outweighed this negative, till 2 days ago, when all features, including the on/off switch, suddenly stopped working. The only way to shut the radio is now by pulling the plug, and ALL other features have failed. I replaced the lithium battery, to no avail. I won't buy this again."
1850,4,"I have 3 of these I got from an Ebay seller in Hong Kong for $4 each with free shipping. They work. The sound quality is not the best, but adequate. There is a slight hiss that can be heard between songs, but it's not bad. The main purpose for these is so I can listen to my favorite tunes on my vintage AM/FM radios. The only issue is they drain the batteries even if turned off(takes about a week to drain batteries in off position). I just remove one battery when not using the unit. But then you lose the time and presets-no big deal for me. A tip for best sound quality-turn volume of source audio device up as high as you can go without distorting, then back off just a little bit. Too much volume will cause distortion. Not enough volume will give low signal to noise ratio."
1851,5,It is hard to find an extension cord especially the power strip surge cord that has a long enough cord itself.  This is perfect.  I have an old house that does not have hardly any outlets.  I use a lot of powerstrip cords.  I feel safe using them with the power surge protector.  The 25 foot cord is an added bonus.  I can put electronics where I want them instead of having to put them close to an outlet.  This is especially great since as I said I do not have many outlets.  The narrow build of it holds the cords and fits nicely behind the cabinet etc without protruding and being in the way.
1852,5,"Just what I expected and a little more. It looks good, works great and has the safety sliders on top of each outlet. It is better than a cheap one you'd buy around [...] bucks. I previously had an earthing issue and two of my laptops were connected to a high end surge protector and it saved the laptops while the bulbs and rest of the things that weren't connected to a surge protector fried including TV ! I think it's a good idea to have a surge protector for electronics."
1853,1,"This product is a waste of money.    The unit can not keep a charge for an iPod.  The USB cable that comes with this kit when plugged to either an AC adapter which I have always been successful with charging with my iPad does not seem to keep it charged up.  I even tried attaching the USB cable to a computer, the charge does not hold.    Also when plugging the video cables to a TV, the colored appear bleached."
1854,1,"Pros: it takes up very little space and it's attractive.  Cons: The FM tuner is horrible. It never stays tuned to the radio signal; I have to adjust the tuner on the remote control up or down, then back every 1/2 hour or so each time the signal goes out.  Next, despite attempts to preset the volume level, every time I turn my system on, it tuns on at the default FULL VOLUME level of 20.  The sound is horrible. Garbled. I had to set the bass ALL THE WAY DOWN and the treble ALL THE WAY UP to get a sound that was barely decent.    I wish I could return it, but I didn't keep the packaging. Big mistake."
1855,2,"The push buttons and presents are very nice and the sound is really good for a shower radio, but it leaks. The plastic covering the push buttons eventually cracks and allows water to leak inside. The tuning is very touchy which is typical for these radios, but the preset buttons mean you only tune it once.     I would not recommend this item. I was very disappointed when I had to through mine away.  I currently have a Jensen JWM-120, but its antenna is weak"
1856,4,"I am not sure where the negative reviews come from regarding the sound quality.  I am extremely picky about my headphones and have bought many different over-the-ear style headphones and these are by far the best for the price.  My only problem with them is that after 8-12 months the left ear goes out on me for whatever reason, probably excessive sweat.      For $30 you can't do better.  The sound quality is actually fantastic, good bass, loud volume.  I've recently tried a $20 pair from JVC and a $40 pair from Sony and both had no bass, and I had to turn my MP3 player volume all the way up just to be able to barely hear it in a crowded gym.  I never had that problem with the Flow."
1857,5,"If you enjoy listing  to music and use you computer, ipod, ipad, phone, mp3 player this box will change your life.  When you use the DAC in this device with even with a ok set of small powered speakers like the [[ASIN:B000OABTPQ Audioengine A5 Powered Multimedia Speaker System (Black)]] the sound quality is markably better compared to any Bose, B&W or compact I-pod sound system.   The DAC is the most important place in the audio chain and[[ASIN:B004H5UYLO HRT iStreamer Outboard DAC for iDevices]] nailed it with the iStreamer.     It's like rediscovering all the music I loved all over again. It even make Lil John sound better.     I want their DAC ship built into my Droid so I hook up my headphones and enjoy this sound when I travel.    I will buy a few more of these for sure."
1858,3,The case is just fine we just needed one that would mount on the back of the headrest and couldn't find one. We were able to make this one work though.
1859,4,I liked everything about this speaker...........except the cord is only about six inches long.  This means it has to be immediately next to your music source.
1860,4,"I bought this stereo speaker for my Nano 5th generation about a month ago. Took it with me to celebrate New Years in Las Vegas. I used it quite a bit the entire weekend. It really cranks out the volume. The only problem that I had with the unit is that it does not hold a charge overnight. I would play it during the evening in my suite before I went out at night and also in the morning when I got up. But whenever I would try to play it the following morning the battery would be dead, I would have to use the AC cord to recharge it. Glad I brought it with me.    I would give it 5 stars, if I didn't have this problem."
1861,1,"Not impressed at all.  Too bad because I always thought Pioneer meant quality but this product is nothing but junk.  After a couple of hours cataloging and inserting all my cds I was looking forward to sitting and listening and learning what my player can do and after only the second cd change the machine jammed, the carousel would not turn, so I was forced to unscrew the case to remove the jammed cd.  That was all I needed if it jammed once it will jam again. I do not need the headache; it gets returned and my search continues for a more reliable product."
1862,4,"This is my fourth pair of earbud style earphones. My first pair was the (now legendary) Sony MDR-EX70, a very tight, bass filled earbud which fit great in my ears. After many years of use, I decided to give the high end a try, and started with the Shure SE530. For some reason I could never get a proper fit, even with the plethora of tips included, and so the bass response, at least for me, was nowhere near as good as the much cheaper Sonys. So I ended up swapping those out and exchanging for Sennheiser IE-8s, and for the last year or so, have been very pleased with their performance - crisp, deep bass, mellow mids and treble, but a richness that the Sonys very clearly lacked.<br /><br />Now I get a chance to try the Ultimate Ears 700s. I realize that these cost roughly half what I paid for the Sennheisers, and as such are not in the same league. But having said that, I have been very impressed with the 700s overall performance. Bass (are you sensing a theme with me yet? :) ), well, it's not as deep as the higher end buds. But then again, the higher end ones are designed to go all the way in your ear... the 700s, by contrast, are only designed to sit at a shallow depth. This definitely reduces their ability to reproduce very low sounds, but at the same time makes them much, much easier to get in and out of your ear. Believe me when I say this - that is a BIG deal if you are constantly on the go, either exercising, walking to / from work, etc. I pretty much use my IE8s sitting at a desk all day, so I have enough time to fiddle with them to get them to sit just right. The 700s don't require any of that magic rain dance - just stick 'em in and you're good!<br /><br />So... back to the sound. The 700s like I said are maybe not as punchy in the lows, but when you get into the mids, and especially the highs, there is actually a very wide soundstage. I am hesitant to say it, but it might even be wider than the high end IE8!<br /><br />I listened to various genres with the 700s, comparing to how they sound against the other three buds I've used, and overall they hold their own at their price point. They are definitely a big step up from the Sony, while not achieving the really punchy and deep sounds of the really high end Sennheisers. In their own space, they give a great soundstage, with maybe one small caveat: I did notice I had to turn the volume up quite a bit more with the 700s than I did with the IE8s. Not a big deal, as I usually have the volume very low, but for those of you with iPhone / iPod / other portable music devices, you're probably going to need to increase the volume a bit to get a good sound out of the 700s. I did not notice any distortion or static when playing at the higher volumes though, so it seems that just a little more power makes these headphones shine.<br /><br />Bottom line - if you're looking for an upgrade from stock or entry level headphones, these will do the trick very nicely. If you are a bass head (like me!), you might not be blown away by the performance, but I believe the mids and highs more than make up for the rolloff in the lows. I believe these headphones are good value for the price, and the inclusion of a nice hard case helps to complete the package.ey sound against the other three buds I've used, and overall they hold their own at their price point.

1863,3,Have not been able to connect to our wireless internet connection at home. In trying to do so I have lost internet access for all our computers. Fun stuff. It does work in free wi-fi establishments.<br />This was a gift for my son and he is grateful but I am hoping he'll be amazed once we get wi-fi working at home and his mom quits messing with internet configurations and passwords she knows nothing about.
1864,5,I buy nothing but Verbatim dvd-r.  These were at such an awesome low price and never had any problems with them.  Highly recommended.
1865,2,"MY HUSBAND IS THE BIGGIST RAIDER'S FAN,     I LOOK ALL OVER FOR THESE EAR BUD AND I WAS HAPPY TO FIND THEM ON AMZON.COM. THET ARE VERY OK, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF THEY CAME WITH EXTRA SIZES OF EAR BUD, JUST NOT ONE SIZE. THESE OAKLAND RAIDER EAR BUDS WHERE VERY HIGH IN PRICED.    BUT MY HUSBAND LOVES THEM SO I GUESS THEY ARE WORTH WHAT I PAID FOR THEM."
1866,2,"I am not a computer geek but do like gadgets and not a big apple fan. I have 4 of the older zens with video capabilities and they work great and only a few quirks but for what all of us put these little dudes through they have worked great and amazon unbox will download videos to them and recognize them but not this new one which i bought the 16gb touch screen one thinking I could watch some of my downloaded shows that I miss when im working which my idea was great in theory but unbox will not recognize it and wont download my shows to it...plus the creative centrale software is a nightmare and it doesnt even work on my older windows xp media center edition computer...it will install but never runs...never, ive been told to uninstall and back date things and roll things back to service pack 2 or windows media player 10 which is a pain and still nothing works. I guess the music sounds ok when I actually use it but for the most part it was a waste of my money and i think if someone else is looking for something they can download music to and the occasional missed tv show then dont buy this product. I have yet to find a place to sell me my missed shows that will recognize my player or download to it, I was even directed to us the apple software to try to download to it, if I had wanted to do that I wouldve bought and ipod....which I have kinda thought they were never ending money pits because it seemed they want you to pay for everything you add. I was very disappointed in this purchase but i think that they put the cart before the horse trying to stay up with the Jones...their older players worked well, I dont think I will buy another creative product for awhile....maybe they need to work on the software or the interphase to make sure their product works and not expect technology to develop around it, yes necessity is the mother of inventions but the average person isnt going to develop the software to make this thing do everything they advertise it to do."
1867,4,"Okay, before I start with my review I would just like to point out that people tend to expect too much from the Archos 5. It's NOT a Laptop it won't work like one (and even laptops mess up), and its not an ipod (which apple has seemed to perfect.)    The Good:  Nice disc space  I can just put all my music and stuff straight on there (I didn't like messing with itunes before)  pretty good size screen  Videos are clear and easy to see  Plays all my videos that were for my ipod classic (pretty good too)  you can put flash 9 games on it  customization     The Bad:  Froze up on me the first day I had it and it took a while to get it to come back on  every so often it tells me that my media isn't available (a simple reboot fixes that)  you have to pay 40 bucks to play high def movies (it only plays avi and mp4/m4v)    I think a lot of personal opinion has to be considered with this product, some people want an absolutely perfect product and some will overlook the flaws. I don't think the problems are too bad because I haven't had too many of them I do hope the firmware updates fix them though."
1868,5,"I wouldn't say that it's the best pair of headphones that I've ever had, but it gets close. It certainly is the best when considering the price. Can't expect noise cancellation but it provides plenty of noise exclusion. What's great is that it's very simple. There aren't any volume controls which is fine since I never use it anyways. You can easily use it while running outside and it doesn't keep falling off as some cheap headphones do. Definitely recommended."
1869,5,"Really tiny, fits into a pocket, and great design - no loose wires!    The sound quality is nice, much better than my laptops built-in speakers, let alone the netbook's speaker.    It is surprisingly loud, but not REALLY loud. Of course you'll need big speakers, not these if you want to throw a dancing party or something."
1870,5,"I purchased the top of the line ipod dock in the store - the Sony RDP-XF100iP    Hands down it was the best sounding out of all 10 that were on display.  I was seriously considering buying it.  The typical \\""poo poo\\""ing of the BOSE system due to cost came from every single store rep.  They didnt even carry it.      I bought the Sony.  And then went and bought the BOSE.    And i sat them next to eachother playing House/Electro House music (extreme highs, midranges, and lows all together).    It was almost laughable how bad the Sony sounded in comparison to the BOSE.  Almost as if I was shocked they could sell it with a clear conscience.  And the Sony was the best out of *ALL* the other ones in that particular store.  The Logitech with all the great reviews - LOL!!!  I had to laugh.    And the best of the best paled in comparison to the sound quality the BOSE puts out.  Spend the money."
1871,5,"These cables by Mediabridge are every bit the equal of the much more expensive cables - as in 3 times as much more - offered by the big names like Monster, etc.  The bottom line to these HDMI performers is that they are certified Category 2, which is the highest current rating by HDMI.org.  It's not about whether they are 'gas injected dielectric' or other techno-speak by the pricier competition.  It's whether they are certified to perform at Category 2 standards for throughput and how well they are made.  These cables are very well made and definitely perform.  A good test for those of you with a PS3 and a 1080P capable HDTV is to go into the Video Output of the PS3 and check the highest quality setting which is 1080p (not 1080i).  I have tried to pass 1080p with lesser rated cables, even very good ones, and the PS3 simply can't pass the signal over those Cat 1 cables.  But, as soon as I connected these Mediabridge cables, the signal passed cleanly, for the best possible picture.  So, you can spend about $10 on these or get the Monster at over 3 times the price - you won't get 3 times the performance, but you will have that wonderful gas injected dielectric feature.  Your call, but I'd go with the Mediabridge and spend the extra $25 on more cables or something else."
1872,5,I like the look and the quality of this mouse pad but it's a bit smaller than the normal mouse pad size. Good thing it wasn't too expensive!
1873,4,This is a solid piece of furniture. Very easy to put together and it looks well made. Not flimsy at all.
1874,4,"I bought this for my father who just wanted to listen to some music while traveling to and from work. It does it's job. Put on the custom firmware from Rockbox, and I was impressed that it offered games! Menu navigation could be better IMO. It did freeze after a month, wouldn't turn on nor charge, but after looking on Sandisk forums I did a reset (hold power button for ~15 seconds) and it worked again.    The only thing that bugs me is that it only comes with a USB cable to charge and transfer. I would've preferred an outlet charger but my Razr phone charger works, though it turns the thing on so I have to remember to turn it off after charging from an outlet. Hopefully someone also fixes the PC charging in Windows 7 that incorrectly displays the battery level, out of convenience.    So, if you're looking for a cheap mp3 player just for music and don't need several billion songs, consider this."
1875,4,"I have always been an infinity speaker man, but these speakers were too hard to pass up. They were easy to install, sound great, and have a lot of bass for their size. The upper frequency is a little off for me ( i like the brightness of a kappa tweeter) but still they are very good. Makes for a great remote location speaker, or for some discrete surround sound. I have them mate to a wall control knob in the kitchen. [[ASIN:B000V52CP0 Pyle Home PVC1 Wall Mount Rotary Volume Control Knob]]"

1877,5,"I ordered this for my wife, who's laptop charger went out (We believe it was faulty when we got it, but that's another story.) She owns a Toshiba Laptop that requires a pa3715u-1aca adapter. I checked local electronics stores, and the cheapest replacement was a universal adapter for about $80 and up to about $120 for a direct replacement. I found this one on here for under $13 including shipping. If it didn't work, then it wouldn't be a real big loss. The item shipped quickly, and was delivered in a box. I checked the specs on the adapter before plugging it in, and everything seemed to match up properly, such as voltage, polarity, and the plug-in itself. After gaining a full charge, my wife said that it actually seemed to work better than the original. She's been using it for the past week and says that her laptop holds a longer charge, and that the charge time is lower. I don't believe that this is some kind of super charger, but in fact a charger that does what the original wasn't doing (possibly faulty original). I can't speak for other models, but if your laptop needs a pa3715u-1aca model adapter, get this one."
1878,5,"Given this is the first review, I will be thorough.    I've owned the Creative D100 Wireless Bluetooth Speaker for two months (paid $78.47).  I'm very pleased.  The sound quality is excellent for this type of speaker.  The volume is loud enough to completely fill a room or a small outdoor area (e.g., patio).  I've enjoyed it on the beach and found quality does not suffer much at high volumes.      Like with any small speaker, if you crank it to max volume, there is some distortion on bass-heavy songs.  But the distortion is slight, and the bass sounds great if you have the volume appropriately set for the type of audio you are streaming.    On that note, there is no remote.  The only way to control the volume is the `volume up' and `volume down' buttons on the front of the speaker or directly from streaming device ONLY IF it allows it.  That is, my iPhone (3G - iOS 3.1.3) CANNOT change the speaker's volume while streaming, but my laptop can.  In my use, I have not needed a remote.  Usually I directly set the speaker's volume for the environment (e.g., bathroom, patio) and forget it.  No remote also means you must control the streaming media from your device.  There are no media control buttons on the speaker.    There is an auxiliary input on the back of the speaker, if you want to hook up a non-bluetooth device, or maybe just to save battery by not using Bluetooth.    Pairing with Bluetooth-capable devices (in my case, iPhone 3G and HP laptop) is simple and quick.    Battery life (four AA) is excellent.  It is so long I cannot even put an estimate in terms of hours.  It also came with an AC adapter, but I have never used it.  The battery compartment is underneath the speaker.    The speaker is fairly small and very light.  I actually carry it from room-to-room to enjoy while I am doing chores.    My only concern with the speaker is the build quality.  The plastic casing is sturdy, but the front face of the speaker (surrounding the name plate and volume controls) ismade of cloth.  The cloth is spongy, but I am worried that it will inevitably tear with my heavy use of the speaker.  There is no travel case included with the speaker.    Looking for a portable Bluetooth wireless speaker, I also considered the Logitech Z515 ($90, smaller and cloth-free).  I've never used that Logitech speaker, but I ultimately chose the Creative D100 based on superior reviews for sound quality and bass quality.  Look into both.  There are good reviews for them and a comparison on CNET, if you want more information.    On the front of the speaker:  Volume up button  Volume down button  Bluetooth connect button    On the back of the speaker:  Power (on/off) switch  Aux input  5V AC adapter input    Underneath the speaker:  Battery compartment (four AA)"
1879,5,"Quick Review  ----------------------  Pro's:  Light, *Extremely* Comfortable, Great Sound, Great Craftsmanship, Amazing Bass, Price (79.99 Average, Shipping Included)    Con's:  Very short headphone cord, Have to Adjust EQ to get optimal sound, Need a quality sound card or a Mobo with great on-board audio to access an EQ for headphone adjustment, loud for nearby people (Not advised for office listening)    4.8 / 5.0 - Overall Rating  ----------------------    Full Review  ----------------------  Right out of the box these headphones feel very squishy and light with *excessive* ear padding and padding on the top bridge of the headphones as well, almost assuring you before you put them on that these will be comfy - and they are, Exceptionally!  I wore these with no discomfort for over 12 hours straight.  After a few minor EQ adjustments with my Creative X-Fi Fatality sound card these headphones come to life and sound better than the $299.00 Bose and Dr. Dre counterparts frequently shown at Best Buy.  High's and Mid's are crystal clear with a little EQ adjusting and the bass does *not* \\""muddy\\"" them up.  The cable connecting the headphones from jack to your head is very very small at only 4ft long I would advise purchasing a cable extender if used other than with an mp3 player or PC right next to you.  The cable is also flat, which is new to me and it seems to avoid tangling that way and works out great.  The sound bleeds out of these when being used so I do advise not using in an office environment, library, or anywhere that low noise is desired although for home use this does not matter.  The advertised low frequency of 4Hz these headphones do attain, though anything over 18kHz is usually not noticed by the general population so I did not test over 17kHz.  Purchase price for me was $38.95 - Free Shipping.  Durability was not rated because I have not owned them long enough.    Value 5/5  Overall 9.7/10    What I paid for this product:  $38.95 - Free Shipping  What I would have paid for this product:  ~$100.00"
1880,4,For $15.00 you can't go wrong with these. I am just about as cheep as person can be and i am happy with them. In fact to get free shipping i bought 2 sets. I use them every day and so far have had no problems. The one thing to note is they have very little or no sound cancelling effect. Although with the music turned up you can't here much else.
1881,5,"Winegard is a very well respected manufacturer of antennae and they have been around for many many years.  I've used different antennas from Winegard for over 40 years all providing high quality VHF, UHF and FM reception. The only reason I changed antennas was due to moving.    Using a good antenna is especially fun now because it allows any of us to pull in for FREE the 1080i or 720p HD TV signals that television stations broadcast now.    I just moved to a location about 18 miles east of Nashville TN and picked up the HD-7015 antenna.  The antenna is located in my attic and is being used with the Winegard AP-8700 preamplifier.  I'm using the preamplifier because the 75 ohm cable from the amp is feeding a 8 way splitter.  The antenna picks up about 30 stations in and around the Nashville area.  Those stations that broadcast in HD show up beautifully on the TV.    The price was great and the operation is great.    The only complaint I have is concerning the Amazon partner called The Price Pros, the company that provides this equipment.  The first antenna I received had a 30 degree bend in the antenna's main frame.  The Price Pro customer service people did handle the replacement of the antenna in a very professional way and provided a UPS sticker for the return.  The new or 2nd antenna was not bent like the first one but the box was torn and battered like it had been used 10 or more times.  There were some small screw pieces missing in this box as well but I had replacements for those so did not contact Price Pros about it."
1882,5,"These earphones were a very good buy.  The sound quality is great, well above average.  Very clear with full range of sound, even on the low end (bass).  Phone calls are clear with no complaints by the person on the other side.  I use them for Skype calls on my computer too and they work great for that as well.  They come with a case and 3 sizes of ear cushions.  The case is really nice.  I've not used one before, but I'm going to start using one now as I'm sure it will extend their life.  The cushions are comfortable and switch out easy.  The wire is same thickness as the ones that came with my phone, but the connector is better quality.  Quite pleased across the board and I'd get them again."
1883,5,"Scenario 1) If you've ever walked into an audio store before, you may feel somewhat intimidated by the looks you get when you tell them your budget of 300 dollars a pair. They'll show you the puniest little bookshelf speaker, and proceed to compare it to maybe a 600 dollar speaker. The 600 dollar speaker will sound fuller, and fill the room better. The small, cheap bookshelf will feel inadequate, especially to the average person accustomed to listening in a tiny little car or something of that sort.    The reasons for this are simple physics and economics. They want you to buy the bigger, pricier speaker so they'll probably make it louder, and the bigger speaker will get louder more smoothly because the speaker driver moves more easily without the stiff air spring of a small box.    Now the dealer suggests using the small speaker as a surround and the bigger one as a front. He gives you a quote and it's virtually double what you expect. It sounds good, but you're not an audiophile who knows what those reviews ever even talk about when they get enchanted by the precision imaging and encompassing soundstage and warm blanketing bass and muddy, dark midrange. If you just read that and thought \\""huh\\"" then you're right. You're just someone who wants it to sound clear, right, and not have to sell your car to do it. So you give up and you're about to buy a Home Theater in a Box because your conclusion after scenario 1 was that a true home theater is too expensive. You don't need to settle for par just because of your budget. There are options out there. This is one of the best ones.    Let's start with WHY:    When you audition a speaker, you're sometimes impressed by things in audio that you think you know. The bass, the treble, the fullness. Can you really say what about those things during an audition impresses you? Most speakers in this price range are made to impress. You'll be shocked to hear what you perceive as great bass out of a little bose satellite, for example.Unfortunately, you're wrong. Exaggerated bass and great bass are totally different things. Movies and music are mixed on $5-15,000 monitor speakers that send out what they get in, not exaggerating or underemphasizing any particular part of a sound. If they want an explosion to bang on their monitor, it should not \\""double bang\\"" on yours. That just ends up sounding unnatural.    Likewise with voices. You can probably tell the difference between a voice in real life and a voice on a speaker in this price range. There's many reasons for this, but coloration is the main one. What is coloration, you ask? It's when a speaker adds its own signature to a sound. 99% of speakers are guilty of coloration, in any price range. The scientific methods to remove colorations are very impractical and weigh a lot. Your goal in buying a speaker should be minimal coloration. You don't want to buy a TV with a green tint, so why buy a speaker with a bass boost around 250hz and treble boost at 4000hz? It's just an injustice to the source material. Real life does not have bass boost and treble boost, nor do recording microphones have bass cuts or treble cuts.    That brings us to this speaker. It excels in its smooth frequency response in the midrange. In doing so, it presents to you the part of most movies and music we actually hear in their similar to how it's intended to be presented. And that in turn brings a new life to audio. What you're hearing is no longer exaggeration common in most speakers, but just the wholesome goods. It's as uncolored a speaker as you'll find in the price range. And that will bring you clarity and realism. At worst, there might be just a slight bit of cabinet resonance adding a hint of warmth to the upper bass, but that's not always a bad thing. It's not my ideal thing, but it won't be nearly as colored as what you'll find in the price range.    That brings us to the question of Timbre. People often wonder if they can pair their x brand speaker pair with y brand center. This is an issue because colorations can cause different voices. In this sense, relatively uncolored is its own timbre. You can match this speaker with other relatively uncolored speakers for a smooth transition. The best choice is the EMP E5Ci of course, as it's designed by the same people, is part of the same line, and uses the same drivers. Another option, if your setup allows, is to place a single E5Bi in the center above or below your TV. Vertical centers, while impractical, can have the best sounding results.    So the mids are uncolored and the treble and bass are level matched to them. How are the treble and bass? The bass is tight up to its tuning, and then falls off dramatically. Paired with a quality subwoofer, this simply won't be an issue. The tweeter used in this speaker is a nicely detailed, easy to listen to tweeter. You can point them directly at your ears and it won't sound harsh. The tradeoff however is that it does roll off the upper treble somewhat. You may find cymbals and triangles to sound a bit quieter than you're used, as most speakers in particular don't just have a flat treble response, but instead a hyped treble response. The highs on this speaker are relaxing. Clear and unhidden, but not completely flat. This can be a good thing, as some recordings have some high frequency information which isn't meant to be heard by anyone but the mixer. IT can be a bad thing, as it's not perfection. I'll take a slightly rolled off treble over an exaggerated treble any day. If you so desire, you can always EQ this to be flat with your receiver.    Next we have to get to this speaker's ability to center an image. This is more important in 2-channel stereo than it is in 5 channel surround, but basically, it's regarding the speaker's ability to place voices at the center between them. And when the voices move, they move smoothly and distinctly. It's tough to describe, but basically a stereo pair of speakers should be able to bounce a sound between and often around them. Many speakers fail to do this, and instead have sound a single \\""field\\"" between them, no matter the signal being fed. I have to give this guy a thumbs up.    Soundstage. Where does it feel the sound is? I'd say it feels like it's in front of me, where the speakers are as well as behind them and well wide of them. These speakers do soundstaging well. They won't bring the sound right to your face though.    Next we have to look at off-axis response. Some speakers sound good if you're listening dead-on, but highs can be lost as you shift seats. Most living rooms aren't dedicated home theaters, and most poeple spending this much money are using their living rooms. I can safely say that the off axis response of the E5Bis is excellent. Luckily this speaker has very nice off axis response, so every seat will sound very similar. Indeed, it's got a very wide \\""listening sweet spot\\"".    Finally we'll consider dynamics. Quite simply, don't expect cinematic dynamics out of ANY bookshelf speaker, especially one with a dome tweeter. Don't expect gunfire to knock you out of your seat out of any bookshelf at any price range. You need huge speakers with compression drivers to get that cinematic experience. Towers will always best bookshelves in this regard too. Bookshelves are a compromise for the most part. They can be great, but don't expect total magic. For its size, this speaker seemed to have quality dynamics. It won't sound nearly as compressed as many of its competitors.    Pros:  Excellent instrument distinction and clarity. Music sounds wonderful and real.  Vocal excellence. Singers and actors will sound very close to the real thing.  8-ohm impedance means you can match it with just about any receiver without any concern.  Extention down to 80hz means you can use the optimal blend to your subwoofer.  Weighs only 7.5 lb  Very beautiful finish.  Excellent detail,  Sharp imaging.    Cons:  It can take 100 watts and get loud, but don't expect cinematic reference levels of loudness. You need bigger, badder speakers like that.. like The DIYSoundGroup SEOS12 Zephyr!  Not a satellite speaker.. it's a proper bookshelf. Satellites are VERY small. HSU and EMP both offer some decent satellites.  Somewhat resonant to the touch. If I could, I would probably open it up and line it with rigid fiberboard so the box vibrates less.  Not perfect with an 80hz crossover, which is reasonable given the price point. It's doable, but it won't be as flawlessly smooth as maybe a 100hz crossover. Audio theory suggests a 60 or 80hz crossover to a sub for the most seamless integration. With an 100hz crossover, you may find the subwoofer to be slightly localizable at times.  Rear Ported makes it somewhat questionable to wall-mount but again, it's very doable.  Low sensitivity means you may have to push your receiver a bit harder than usual to get good volume, but any 60-100 watt receiver will do fine in a moderate sized room.  It's still a bookshelf speaker. Pairing it with a subwoofer is a must.  It's not its big brother, the made-of-stone Status Acoustics Decimo! LOL!

1884,5,"Take off the rubber tip before use!    I was so pissed off at these cables at first, only to realize it was my own stupidity for the cables not fitting right. I plugged in the cable and it just was extremely loose, I thought it was just a poorly made cable because it did not snap in as I was used to. Turned on my ps3 no sound, wtf, I ended up taking another cable I had and compared the two... Only to realize this amazon one had the rubber protective shielding over it still! Took it off plugged it in, snapped in to place, sounds wonderful. People who complain about this cable not fitting well or being loose, check the cable tip.    Cheers!"
1885,1,"IF YOU CANNOT HEAR THE SOUND, THE MP3 PLAYER IS USELESS.    I clearly received a defective unit, and I can't support a company that produces such obviously defective products.      The headphone port on my unit did not securely hold the headphone jack, causing the sound to cut in and out at the slightest jostling.  It is the year 2010!  Are you telling me SanDisk can't build a headphone port that securely holds a headphone jack?      The headphone jack was suspect from the very first second I put the headphones in.  Where was quality control?    I exchanged my SanDisk for a Sony, and wouldn't you know it: the Sony headphone jack works great."
1886,5,"I have also owned these speakers for over 30 years. Paid 1200 for the pair, brand new and unfinished. Still own them. I can easily describe these speakers in one word....incredible.  When you hear them, you will want them. You will do like I did....found a way to get the money together to buy a pair. If I could afford them, I would build an audio room and have a pair of Klipschorns in the corners. Best speakers in the world, in my opinion."
1887,3,"I was excited when this cable arrived, so I could watch content from either my iPad or iPhone 4 on different TV's around the house (Netflix, iPod Videos, and especially the Air Video app) without having to lug my laptop to the TV all the time.  It worked on my big screen HDTV in the living room (though Netflix quality was TERRIBLE, and the Air Video app couldn't output many of my videos - perhaps a resolution limitation with the cable?).  But the video was completely garbled and flickering on my 37\\"" tube TV in the bedroom, even though the same component video inputs work fine with my DVD player.  So I had mixed results.  Not sure if it's the cable or my old TV, but I'm going to return it and see if I have better luck with the official Apple cable (even though it pains me to pay a premium, especially if I suffer the exact same problem).  It's a shame Apple doesn't provide a 30-pin connector to HDMI adapter for HD output - there's a HUGE quality difference between playing content from the iPad or iPhone 4 compared to plugging my Macbook Pro directly into the TV through a Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter. I was hoping to not have to lug my laptop all the time, but I might be stuck doing that if I want good quality and reliable playback."
1888,3,"Pros:<br />Great sound isolation<br />Braided cable<br />assortment of included accessories.<br />Metal construction (sturdy)<br /><br />Cons:<br />Poor sound stage<br />Muddy mid-bass<br />Metal construction (cold, very cold)<br /><br />The Pure 1000 10mm earphone is great for those looking for an sound isolating earphone for occasional use.  (i.e. mowing the lawn, using a table saw)<br />Any situation where critical listening is not really required.<br />I recommend anyone looking to spend this much on earphones to check out the Esures or the highly recommended Klipsch IMAGE S4 instead."
1889,5,"This is a great device for anyone who can't receive decent radio reception, as well as those who just want to have a large variety of listening options.  The sound quality is outstanding!"
1890,5,"I did a lot of reading trying to find a high-quality headphone amp that didn't cost a fortune, and did everything I wanted/needed it to.    USB-input for connection to iPad (via camera kit) or laptop.  Mini-optical input for connection to MacBook Pro.  3.5MM audio out for connection to line-out adapter on iPod.    It also has a co-axial optical in, and RCA line-in, in case you need them.    Sound quality is amazing.  I'm currently using it with Sennheiser HD650 headphones, and have used my iPad, iPod, and laptop as audio sources.  You definitely want to make sure you rip your audio CD's in lossless format.  If you're using a high-quality headphone amp like this, and have a good set of `phones, you will want your source material to be of equal quality.  And since the HDP has a built-in DAC, having a purely digital input is about as good as you're going to get for this.      My HD650's are 300ohm, so they need a good driver, and the HDP drives them perfectly well.  They'll get much louder than I would ever use.  I also tested it with my Grado 60's, and it switches over to low impedance headphones with no problems.      Great headphone amp for the money.  There are better, but they also cost much, much more.  There are cheaper, but they will not have all these features, the build-in DAC, or the quality.    If you want something portable to carry with your iPod, I would probably recommend a battery-operated micro amp, since the HDP with it's external adapter and power cable, can get pretty big to carry around.  For home or office use, though, HIGHLY recommended."
1891,4,I use it for my outdoor bootcamps. I put the radio at one end of the field and perform exercises around the 1/4 track and from any point of the high school football stadium i could hear the music playing.
1892,4,"Just received my new Rockford Fosgate Punch Plugs and I'm very impressed. They have a reasonably comfortable fit, crisp sound (except for a little tinny tone that works its way out after burn-in), and booming bass. I'm completely sold on the flat cord. I wasn't sure if I'd like it, but it's the way I'm going on all future earphones. I can't wait until I get these through the initial burn-in period so I can truly experience the audio quality. I'm told 100 hours is the optimal burn in time.    My only complaint is the lack of variety with the earphone nibs. The set is shipped with a small selection and omits many popular options that less expensive earphones provide. You'd think that for retailing at $100 that Rockford Fosgate could kick in a full variety of nibs since some of the reviews I read before purchasing these hit on comfort being an issue. This could be an easy and cheap way for them to boost the overall value.    Overall, I'm satisfied. If you're looking for a quality set of in-ear earphones with a full bass sound in the range of $65-$100, these are going to be hard to beat."
1893,1,"I ordered the MRI1211US model, but what I received was the MRI1511US model. The model I received has the same dimensions, also provides 120W through the socket, but instead of 1A from the USB port it only provides 500mA. The USB port was to be used to charge an ipod at 1A. I wasn't interested in waiting twice as long to charge it at 500mA.    The other reason I bought this inverter was to charge my HP laptop in the car. The AC adapter for the laptop required only 90W, but when I plugged it into the inverter I noticed the AC adapter was making quite a loud hum. It made me uncomfortable to the point where I didn't want to risk damage to the laptop by having it plugged in. Perhaps its because this inverter delivers power as a modified sine wave, and this 'dirty power' isn't compatible with my AC adapter. When plugged into a house socket the AC adapter is completely quiet.    I returned the inverter as it didn't suit any of my needs."
1894,5,"These are THE best earphones! Especially if you like big full, but clear bass in your music. If you listen to house music these are the only earphones you should consider. I have a pair of the TripleFi and they are great, but lack the full bass sound of these. Unfortunately I don't see these on Ultimateears web site anymore so I am guessing they are no longer being manufactured so get yours today!"
1895,5,"Basically - this wall mount does exactly what it's intended to do: mount a television. I secured it to the studs in my living room, tilted about 6 degrees down. I seriously advise using at least a 3 ft level to mount this. The built-in level may show center and you'll be furious when you get the television mounted.  I bolted on a 52\\"" Samsung LN52B630 and it's still on the wall. No complaints here..."
1896,4,"sound quality is great especially with the sound cancelling feature due to the silicone buds.  i wear them while i work/exercise outside a lot so i occasionally have to adjust the buds to fit in my ears when i am moving around.  other than that, i have no problems and very satisfied with the product since it was a very cheap price."
1897,3,"All right, it's an antenna with an add on signal amplifier included.  It works well, but it takes up LOTS of space, and the base is very tiny, which makes it very top heavy/unstable.  I cannot figure out how any engineer would look at this top heavy thing, which only stands up straight on a level surface, and say it was finished.  It needs some kind of base to be stable, otherwise it flops over.    It does work well, but I don't know if that is because of the design of the antenna, or because it came with a signal amplifier attached."
1898,2,"Very disappointing. I've heard better from less expensive Sony 'phones.     1. Voices have a \\""cupped-hands\\"" sound.     2. Generally sounds as though every instrument is inside a plastic container.    3. Highest frequencies are muddled. No real definition there.    The good points are few. Two of which are:    1. Decent matching between drivers. Very solid middle-of-the-head imaging.    2. Subtle midrange sounds are easily heard.    I don't grade audio by the cost. If it's good, then it's GOOD. The MDR-XD200s in my possession are not."
1899,4,"Quality is good and the sound is well preserved! My only complain is that is really hard to remove the adapter from the cable; other than that it is a really good product for the value, I mean it is just an adapter so it does the job."
1900,5,"got 3 fans and 3 blue led light, one of mine after 3 months or so now strobes but the fans still work so that is why i bought it so, if you dont care for the lights then its a great product"
1901,2,"I just ordered this item and set it up.  I was really disappointed, the sound isn't nearly loud enough and my new Vizio tv speakers sounded better than the sound bar.  I have a small room and didn't want a bunch of speakers and wires to deal with, so I thought this would be perfect.  The sound just isn't good enough to warrant keeping it."
1902,5,"I'm a grad student trying to live a modest life...and so I use my laptop with an HDMI port to watch movies on Netflix and Hulu, etc. I ordered this cable and received it lightning fast! It works JUST as described. There have not been any problems. EXCELLENT length for the price. I would definitely recommend purchasing if you need an off-brand, durable HDMI cable."
1903,5,"This is the best purchase from a value standpoint , that I've made in a long while. Theses headphones are OUTSTANDING. Incredible clarity, detail and are also comfortable. A real winner. For the price they cannot be beat. Sound better than a pair of Sennheiser HD 201's that I just purchased."
1904,2,I have bose ear buds but I wanted a spare pair just in case something happend to my bose and these were recommended highly by someone who's opinion I trust.  I have to disagree with him.  I read several reviews that said these earbuds were great but I hope nothing happens to my bose.  I will keep them but they like that little donut tire that comes as a spare.
1905,5,"This is an excellent product. I had one last year, gave it to a friend and it's still working, bought this one for the office. The best sound quality for such a low price!"
1906,5,"This is the best mousepad you will buy. No, it doesn't have cushions for your wrist, yes, it takes up a lot of space, and for computer virgins it's a soft cloth mousepad, you won't understand it right away. Deal with it. This mousepad has served me outstandingly for more than two years and I can't ever see myself buying another mousepad, when this one finally goes I'm getting another QcK. If you've got a decent laser mouse (1200+ DPI, I'm using a Logitech G9) this mat will make your cursor roll across the screen like butter, and you'll find yourself snapping to exactly where you want to go soon. Whether you're a gamer or you want ease of access to your computer this is the mousepad for you. Buy it. Buy it right now, and buy some for all your friends. People will remember you for buying this mousepad. When you die, they will make statues in your name."
1907,1,"For the price of this lamp you could buy a brand new Sony 46 to 52\\"" LCD HD set.  I think there is about 750 dollars profit on this."
1908,5,This is a high end video server that will take the analog CCTV or webcams and allow you to access them over a network.  If you have some video and computer experience they are a breeze to use.  Not for the beginner but a great product.
1909,5,"I bought this with the intent to use it to encode old VHS so I could render them to DVDs and thus preserve old home movies.  It does so with great ease - no power required if you use a six pin USB cable, and there is absolutely no user input required.  Just plug your VCR or camcorder in on one side, and the firewire out the other side into the Mac, and off you go.    Being a hardware encoder, I simultaneously ingested video while watching a DVD that I had just burned on the Mac, and the Mac didn't even twitch.      The quality is fantastic - looks better than the original VHS.  Also, with iMovie you can edit out all the nonsense that you would end up with if you took an old VHS to a photo or video store to render it.  They're not doing any editing for you for the $30 or so most of them charge."
1910,1,I have had these for one year and the rubber wire covering is cracking in 6 places exposing the copper wire. They are still working but probably not much longer. This casing should not deteriorate this quickly. These also fit awkwardly and constantly rotate out from the ear causing the sound to suck.(the in the ear portion is on a swivel from the ear hook) really annoying.
1911,5,"After reading many positive reviews, and seeing Amazon's low price I decided that this system would be a good fit for my new Panasonic 54\\"" plasma.    The hardest thing about setting up this product is the packaging!  (And I mean that in a good way).  Speakers and receiver are individually wrapped and cradled in Styrofoam with nylon ties.  Unpacking these items, I was impressed with the quality of the speakers and the weight of each.  Heavier magnets in the speaker core usually equates to superior sound reproduction.    The hookup was simple, but I did use Best Buy's \\""Rocketfish\\"" kit for the two surround (rear) speakers.      Out-of-the-box sound was OK, but really spectacular after the menu driven setup/  tuning.  I especially liked the dynamic EQ feature that virtually eliminates the loud commercial syndrome.    I appreciate products that work as advertised, and actually give you more than expected.  The only negative I have is that the owner's manual was not written by an english-speaking writer, and some of the sentences are unintentionally hilarious!"
1912,2,"Was not so difficult to laminate, and you do feel your screen is secured after installation.  But one of the reason I chose this was because it said this is AG,anti glare film which turned out to be completely false.  You still get same amount of reflection/ glare as the bare screen before having film on, so the seller should correct the misleading product description."
1913,5,"Knowing that I was going to upgrade to an hdtv with hdmi, I started shopping for a new receiver to replace my old Yamaha with no hdmi.  I really thought I would just buy another Yamaha, but after researching and reading many reviews from many different sources my brand loyalty was soon to change.  CNET gave very favorable reviews for this Onkyo with no downside at a very good price for what you get. Knowing that the Yamaha, Sony, Denon and others had lukewarm reviews I decided to take the plunge and buy the Onkyo.  I am very pleased with the receiver.  It sounds great!  The audysey sound was easy to follow which allows the receiver to dial the sound right for the sweetspot of where you will be sitting. The onscreen display mades setup very easy. I also like the idea of less cables which means less spaghetti in my audio cabinet. Since I am no techie, I am sure I am only using a small part of its potential.  The remote is easy to use and sync with my cable remote and my wife and kids now have it figured out how to operate it. I put the Onkyo in my cart and noticed after about a week that the price had dropped and without paying taxes I think I saved about 75 bucks and got free shipping."
1914,5,"The Smokin' Black and Chrome earbuds are great and the sound quality exceptional , I would recommend them to everybody !!!"
1915,5,Had purchased cheap imitations of this speaker at a local office supply store at Christmas.  Needed new ones and they turned out to be a special.  So I found these and they were so worth the extra money and don't need to be replace.  They arrived quickly and in excellent condition.  Making happy sounds now!
1916,5,"this thing is about as simple as it gets to install. plug it in and it works.  i have a tv that i bring out on the patio when the weather is nice.  with this receiver, you don't have to bring out all kinds of equipment...just the tv and this box and you are good to go.  great for when we have lots of people over.  we just used it this weekend to watch the fights outside when we had our friends at our house.    it takes about 4 seconds to start working.  if you are on a regular channel and then move to an HD channel, that takes about 3 or 4 seconds too.  but stay on HD or stay on regular channels and ther is no delay when switching channels. super picture and i have no complaints.  can't beat the price either compared to other equipment in its class.  my brother is building a house and wants to put the tv over the fireplace.  so i just bought one for him too.  i recommend it to anyone."
1917,1,This product is great.... for a while.  A short while.  This is one of my favorite sets of headphones but they just don't last.  2-3 months for me.  I've gone through two.  I like it but the price is too steep for the limited durability.
1918,3,"The video quality is great, but it does not support audio because it does not meet VESA standards."
1919,5,The Audio Video cable quickly and easily played a video wmv file to my Bravia HD television.  It is a good way to connect the Sansa View directly to the television or any sound sytem.
1920,5,"This is the second time I bought this wireless TV adapter. This Atlona one was only $129.95 from Electronics-depot. It is the same gadget as one called Warpia except the plastic case is white. It worked great streaming laptop to TV downstairs so I bought it for my second TV upstairs. The video can be choppy if used with Atom based netbook, but it works flawlessly with the core 2 duo based HP notebook. It uses the processor horsepower for the video driver so the comp. must be strong enough to handle it. As long as it is used with the strong computer the video and audio will stream nicely to the TV. Even high def movies."
1921,5,"I bought this mp3 player about 6 years ago and even with continious use it still works like new. the case that came with it is winderful i attatch it to my belt and off i go my only qualm about this mp3 player is the screen, a while back i somehow crushed it and now the screen dosent work this is however my fault and the player continues to work like a dream however no replacement screen is available."
1922,5,"Excellent sound, fit, function, and myriad choices for ear bud tip is absolutely amazing. These people are totally squared-away. Everything I have purchased from them has been on-time (usually ahead of promised delivery date - both via Amazon or direct), and they just deliver excellence.     You cannot go wrong with Etymotic ear buds. Extreme excellence in sound for a very reasonable price.     Bravo Zulu, Etymotic!     Tim"
1923,5,These AAA's are measuring up quite well. They are being used in a MP3 player that usually eats up regular batteries after 3 hours. These last at least 7. I havent let them go completly drained so they may last a little longer than that. Overall they have beaten the duracell accu's I have used in the past.
1924,3,"The general fit is very good, and it feels very good on the iPad.  Some instructions might have helped, as it was a struggle to put on.  None of the openings are in quite the right locations, and as the earlier reviewer wrote, the tether slot is too small for the connector head.  Don't buy one unless you have an X-Acto knife, and some patience.  Making the tether opening large enough to fit on the iPad dock will probably make the front strip quite loose.  I'm not ready to try that just yet."
1925,5,"This is exactly what I was hoping for when I looked for a case - and for the price it can't be beat.  It give the iPad a snug fit and provides enough protection while still looking very sleek.  The logo on front is very discrete and hardly noticeable.   Overall, I would definitely buy this cover again."
1926,4,"This is a really well designed product. It folds up so neatly, it's hard not to want to carry it around. I have it on my desk at work, and my only complaint is that at a very low volume (3 tops) that I have to use in an office setting, the sound sometimes cuts out entirely on some songs. I'm not sure if that's a design problem, or an issue with my set. A couple of times a day, it'll go quiet, and then I have to turn it up for that song. Not a techie, so I'm not sure if it's my music or the speakers. Other than that, it's a lovely solution to the work music problem.<br />BTW, when I took it home and turned it up, the sound was truly wonderful."
1927,4,"Budget *Sony* headphones.    Well, they're not the great sounding quality that you'd expect, but they deliver. And how?    The sound clarity is good, but the sound is not hiked up like in those cheap Chinese-knock offs. End of the day, it's a Sony and it'd atleast last another 6 months. You might get better sounding earphones for far cheaper, but trust me, they wouldn't last as long as branded ones do.    Recommended.    PS: I'm not a hardcore audiophile, but that doesn't mean I don't listen to all kinds of music."
1928,3,"This product really works, but it is not true that it covers the sound. It creates a background noise that induces your brain like a hypnosys... you stay \\""connected\\"" to the sound and if some other sound comes it gets higher so you can still \\""track\\"" the ecotones sound.... but it doesn't cover. It's not a white sound machine!    i bought this with the idea of getting a better sleep. now i have two sources of noise. it is very relaxing, but makes me keep attention on the possibility of having some uncovered noise.     mount is very bad. doesn't look profesional.     anyway... the product does what it promisses. but now im sure that i prefer cover my ears"
1929,4,"I've been using this headset for about a week and so far so good. I like that it has a right-angle plug, makes it better for those of us who don't use an iPhone, like the DROID. Sound quality is good if you can get a good seal. I had trouble with this and read the Klipsch instructions that tell you to point the earplugs upwards when you insert them into your ears, then pull them back a bit. This has helped me get a better seal. Microphone seems to pick my voice up fine. Overall a good headset if you can get it around $35 like I did."
1930,4,"The ipod touch 32gb is almost perfect .The only  complain i have about it is the equalizer , you can not ajust it as u want (can not create your own equalizer).The lack of fm turner and the camera is also a problem otherwise it is a tresor.I'm in love with my ipod touch"
1931,3,"The sound quality is great.  Its a well constructed cable.  However, the head of the cable is too fat.  I have to take my iphone case off in order for the cable to make a connection."
1932,3,Love this product (wife).  If Mama's happy everybody's happy (husband).  We both really do like this product but wish it would work with our HD TV.
1933,3,"We have had a few Clips in our household and they are easy to use for simple paybacks from Audible. The bad news is that battery life is more in the 8 to 10 hour range, rather than the \\""up to 15\\"" mentioned. If you are looking for an all day player, look elsewhere. I am tired of this player cutting out on me."
1934,4,"The system arrived very promptly and well packaged.It was a refurb,so I was concerned of it's condition,but I was like new!The setup was very quick and painless!System sounds great,but I wish the sub was adjustable!That's the only downfall of this unit as I see it."
1935,4,"A very cool looking blue... not as thick as i would have wanted the case to be but its good enough. not rubber band thin like other one i had bought a while back!  so thats good. great placement for the holes n charger n camera, etc. The only bad thing i would say is that on the vertical sides of the case is a tad loose. might be good since it wont touch the screen. Took forever to get to me though...like 9 days. ugh. But was within the last day of delivery estimate. lol. Now for more colors. hope this helps people.  :)"
1936,1,"I wanted to give this item a thorough review, since the two other reviews I read were very brief and not helpful. The cable's appearance is not bad. When you open the package the cable doesn't look like junk. However the cable did not work for the purpose I bought it for. But I wanted to see if the cable worked at all. I tried it out with a number of different televisions, computers, monitors, and dvd players. The cable failed to give a good picture with every combination I tried. My friends were good sports for letting try the cable with their stuff.  The cable sort of worked once with an LG monitor and a dvd player.  But the picture was completely green. I contacted the seller to let them know I will be writing a bad review. Their response was that the cable would work great if I had the correct computer to television combination. Well they should add the names of the devices the cable would work with, since it is obviously very few."
1937,5,This item is great works perfect and the seller responded promptly to my question. This was a pleasant transaction.
1938,5,I bought the Majicjack as an alternative to increasing my cell service which would've cost me $20 more a month. For $20 a year it seemed much more cost effective to buy the Majicjack. It was well worth the investment. The cost is roughly $1.66 a month. Now that in itself is worth the try!    I have the device set up on my PC running XP hardwired to cable internet. I have made and received local and long distance calls on a basestation style wireless phone and have had absolutely no issues with connection or sound quality. The use of the voicemail system is extremely easy to navigate through also.   I have no idea why some of these people have had negative experiences with this device because I haven't had one so far.   You can find the product cheaper at Bestbuy and Walmart (sorry Amazon) so you should purchase it at one of those stores. This way if you do have a bad experience with it you can easily take it back (which I doubt you will have that experience).   I would recommend the Majicjack to everyone.  It truly is worth it. Truly!
1939,4,"I got these speakers yesterday I'M VERY HAPPY, I set them up with my Onkyo receiver they should cost more get them before they are gone!!!"
1940,5,Works very well. Exactly what I was looking for and the unit is built solid. No problems at all.
1941,5,"I received this cover today and it's just perfect for my Nook! The Nook fits in there snuggly but not too tight. The inside liner is nice and soft to prevent scratches and the snap closure is very secure and NOT magnetic which I think might hurt an electronic device like this one. I also like the storage on the inside front cover for business cards and some papers as I like to have a few crossword puzzles with me too! The outside of the cover itself is soft and very pretty. You can access the headphone and charging ports all without removing the Nook from the cover too. All in all, I feel my Nook is very well protected and looking pretty stylish!<br /><br />Shipping was great, I recieved it a day before it was expected. Great seller, I wouldn't hesitate to use them again!"
1942,5,"Got the headphones today and took them out on a 8mi run. The sound was very good, much better then any headphones that I have run in. Excellent fit, and feel, a must have for anyone that listens to music while they run."
1943,5,Item came quickly and works well for what I use it for.  I'm satisfied
1944,4,"This was a pleasant surprise. We wanted to replace a bulky CD player in my daughter's room. We have a couple of old iPods floating around the house and thought it would make sense to have something fun in her room. The speakers turned out to be pretty good for their price. It is no Bose or B&W, but it does not cost as much either. The subwoofer was nice and the speakers produce clear sound. The form factor is very cute, small footprint and keeps it entertaining for the kids .. I think they may have even named it."
1945,4,"These are the nicest disc storage binders I've found.  It's fake leather, but well finished.  It's maybe a bit overpriced for what it is (they seem to have a corner on the market for bookshelf-presentable binders.  The insert pages are high-quality.  Just A few caveats: supposedly these books are expandable with additional insert pages; this is only marginally true, as you can only get a couple of extra pages in before it becomes impossible to close it flat, particularly if you include inserts.  If you store them upright (as on a bookshelf) the pages tend to slump down and if you are not careful you can jam them up when you return the binder to the shelf.  But, overall, no real complaints."
1946,5,"Replaced another HP with this one, only for the wireless function.  We've scanned with it, copied with it and printed with it from multiple wireless laptops on our home network without issue.  Works fine. Print quality is fine. Price was awesome.  Couldnt be happier.  Also, ink cartridges (remanufactured ones) on ebay are really cheap and the quality is great, already tried them."
1947,1,"Hi,<br />I got this product to be used with my ASUS Seashell 1005HA-PU as it is stated to be compatible. Whell... the thing is compatible but after few minutes, got hot, melted and burned. Not the ideal product to be used overnight charging your netbook on your boat, or during a long trip in car, unless you want to burn them...<br /><br />And I am overseas so I cannot even ask for refund now...<br /><br />I do not recommend to waste your money this way."
1948,4,"I've owned this player for many months, and like all but a few things.  Don't get me wrong, I'll never buy any incarnation of iPod.  I'm not a Mac fanatic.  For its' size, I think this unit is a much better choice than anything else on the market.  I just have a few gripes:<br /><br />There is no software for the Mac, and unlike my Panasonic SV-MP020 (simple music-only players, I have several of them), it does not show up as a hard drive when connected to the Mac.  For someone like me who would like to get through the day without turning on my old PC, this is a downer.  I dislike iTunes, and would prefer \\""dragging and dropping\\"" over being locked into software that constantly schemes up new ways to try to drain my wallet, and push their agenda.<br /><br />It does not recognize PNG format images, and pukes on most WMA files (unless created with THEIR software).<br /><br />It CONSTANTLY wants to fade out after 10 seconds (until you change the setting, but won't go over 30 seconds).  It won't loop a directory of images, nor automatically repeat a single video when it gets to the end.  How hard would it be to add these features to the System settings?<br /><br />Lastly, you will find it dead as a stone after just a week of sitting around without being charged.<br /><br />Buy one anyway, because it is still in my \\""top ten\\"" of must-have gadgets.  Load it up with pictures to share and music to entertain - digital entertainment as close as your pocket."
1949,2,"This company does not lose market share because of lack of interested buyers, willing to pay for American products.  They lose it because of lack of quality.  This is the sad conclusion I have reached after having owned and used several Koss headphones:    Pro4AA, my father owned this in the 70s, and they always got the wow!!!s.    SST10 They were just ok, well, the hinges broke within 2 weeks of use.    PRO4XL They were good, until one channel decided to go mute... it was not the wires.  Sent them back to Koss for warranty repair.  They lost them, claiming they never got them, but after they cashed the check with the shipping and handling fee they required.  The check was in the same package as the headphones.    A130 Replaced the lost PRO4XLs.  Amazing clarity, good basses, fantastic imaging, would forget I had them on (very comfortable); they did not have more than 150 hours of use when the sound became all distorted, never used at high volume levels.    Pro4AAT, blah...  I got the PRO4AAT as a warranty replacement for the defective A130s, according to Koss, same class replacement.  They were tight on my head, even with the bands fully extended, had to flex the upper band to get acceptable fit; the head band does not feel right either.  As far as the sound... highs are good, mid range... bland, bass... think about listening to music coming from the other side of a thin wall, terrible...they sound muddy, lack clarity, lack dynamic range, very disappointing.    Called Koss and explained my problem.  They offer to give me $50 towards the purchase of a more expensive set of headphones.  Saw the PRO4AA and thought they would be a good replacement for the PRO4AAT.  Koss offers to replace them as an even exchange.  Then I read the recent PRO4AA reviews.  In a few words, the PRO4AA are not even a shadow of the originals according to the reviewers.  What to do now?    As far as a new buyer... my recommendation is... stay away from the PRO4AATs."
1950,4,"The mount is solid and held 19\\"" LCD securely.  However, make sure you have deep cabinets as this will need >14\\"" for clearance."
1951,5,"I bought a pair of these to replace my 10+ year-old pair from Westclox.  I was looking strickly for an alarm clock, so the AM/FM radio was a bonus for me.  Some reviewers have complained about the green LEDs not being bright enough.  The LEDs are about an inch tall, and easily readable from across the room in a sunshine-lit bedroom, which is what I have certain times of the day.  Another complained about the clock's \\""AM\\"" indicator (this clock has both AM & PM indicators-many alarm clocks only have PM).  My wife is easily confused, and this did not present any problems.  Setting the alarm is a snap.  Each time you turn the alarm on, it provides about a 5-second display of the current alarm setting before defaulting back to the current time.  If you need to adjust the alarm clock, simply toggle the switch one way or the other to set the alarm earlier or later.  We love these clocks!  You won't be disappointed.  One note- it is about twice as big as the alarm clock we got rid of, but again, this is a clock radio."
1952,5,"I have tried another monitor before and have returned it for the lack of sensitivity, it simply was not loud enough to hear the baby. NOT This one, this ONE simply is the BEST. Not to mention the SONY brand, I have tried SONY products before such as laptop, lasted for about 9 yrs, and is still working fine. Great job SONY, keep up a great product and you will continue maintaining consumers."
1953,5,This was a Christmas present for my husband.  He loves listening to old albums he recently has been purchasing.  He absolutely loves this turntable.  It has a great sound and many options.  Would highly recomment this brand.  I was considering another brand until I read the negative reviews and am so glad I chose this one.
1954,2,"Isn't the purpose of burning DVD's is so that you can play them in a DVD player??? I tried the discs in several different players, even a blue ray player, and it didn't work in any of them. They worked on my computer just fine though. Also, I didn't think the images on the disc showed up very well. Overall I'm pretty disappointed."
1955,5,This iPod was a gift for my mother's birthday and she really enjoys using it. It works very well and she's never had any issues with it. It's probably a lot smarter to buy an iPod from Amazon than from the store. I got this for such a good price and low shipping too. Very nice!
1956,4,"These speakers have very high quality sound for the price.  JBL sound is one of the best, and these car speakers are up to the fine JBL audio standard."
1957,5,"This ipod touch is great!  pro: easy to use, portability,lots of storage  con: battery life, some apps can be downloaded but not sync-ed, back of the ipod scratches fast"
1958,2,"I have other Eton crank radios.  I bought this one for the solar charge so it would always be ready, unlike the crank models.  It turns out that in normal daylight coming in a window the radio won't play as the voltage is too low.  I got the unit to work with a 250 watt light bulb directly over the solar cell.  It's winter; perhaps at noon in July with no clouds this radio will play.  The case is rugged and the radio is attractive.  The receiver on these Etons is very cheap.  The rechargeable batteries are small.  The wiring inside is cheaply done.  The crank part works ok, but the solar feature is bad.  I do like some of the new fancy digital alert selection choices and other features in the digital menu.  On the other hand the firmware needs updating: in solar cell mode inadequate light leaves a message of \\""battery low\\"", which isn't what is meant at all.  Instead the voltage from the solar cell is what is actually low and it will operate the menu screen but won't charge the battery or play the radio.  It seems to take a LOT of light to start doing anything.  This thing needs a high efficiency solar cell.  It also needs one of those charge booster circuits that are used in cellphones and newer flashlights so that whatever power is available from the solar cell is boosted up to the needed voltage for the radio.  Ideally the solar mode would work like the crank mode- the radio would work off the battery while the solar cell added whatever power it had.  That way if the solar power was inadequate the batteries would discharge more slowly.  The way it is now the radio cannot use any battery power in solar mode.    The solar cell version isn't worth it.  The crank ones are ok, though I wish the radios and electronic construction were of higher quality.  The solar mode is next to useless outside of bright noon sun.  Good idea but awful execution."
1959,5,"I highly recommend the Rebit Backup Software.  The wife is not the best at backing up her data so I bought this and installed it on a USB external drive.  The only caveat is that the disk you plan to use this on must be completely free of data.  This program does a scan to see if there are any files or documents, and if it finds data, it will not install.  Of course, you could always use a shredder program or reformat the backup drive, then reinstall.  I found it absolutely effortless to  install it on a new drive.    Rebit constantly monitors your main drive and makes almost immediate backups.  With the price of hard drives dropping every week, there's no reason to let you data go unprotected.  Unless of course, there's no baby pictures, or family pictures, tax returns, scanned receipts or nothing else of importance on your computer.  Otherwise, get this program."
1960,5,A great addition to my HiDef video camera.  Allows me to see and share my videos on the big screen.  Quick and easy.
1961,5,GAVE TO WIFE FOR HER IPOD.  SHE IS NOT TECH SAVY BUT FOUND THIS EASY TO SETUP AND USE AND JUST LOVES THE QUALITY OF SOUND.
1962,3,"[[VIDEOID:mo1CR9YCL8HJDTD]]Bose headphones sound great, but they are cheaply made and fall apart in under two years.  So, if you're only interested in using them for a year, go ahead, they sound wonderful.  But, if you are looking for a more long term investment, shop around, because these are not worth the price."
1963,5,I really don't much about speakers....I am not an audiophile.....But I love this speaker system. It does everything and sounds great doing it. It is simple to use and puts out a lot of sound. I would buy it again.
1964,4,"As others have said, it works great for the price. I would have prefered automatic switching as I have in my HDMI switch but can understand for the price this is at it would be hard to do"
1965,4,"I bought this product and got it professionally installed. The mount is very sturdy and holds its own even with the heavier TVs. As long as you are not changing the position of your TV al the time. This will do great. If you are of the habit of adjusting the TV's position too often, the connect plate (where it attaches with the TV) will develop a bit of a horizontal play. This is true for all swing wall mounts. I would absolutely recommend this over the overpriced mounts that retail stores sell. Just as good and much more affordable."
1966,5,My 16 year old son loved it.  Easy to use.  Lots of free apps.
1967,3,"I bought my Zune HD in December and after only about 3 weeks of use, it turned into a black brick.  It wouldn't start up again, even after spending a whole day hooked up to the USB cable.  I tried holding down the button for 10 - 20 seconds and still no response.  After that, the computers in my house wouldn't even recognize that the Zune USB cable had been connected.     I registered my Zune at zune.net and was given directions on how to ship my Zune to Laradeo, Texas for repairs.  I'm not sure if they will try to repair the one I sent back, or just replace the whole unit.    I really think the Zune is a great-looking piece of equipment, but I'm slightly bummed that it didn't last longer.  That's what I get for being an early-adapter!"
1968,4,"I was looking all over for a smaller stereo with big sound and network and internet music features.  I found it with the Logitech Squeezebox Boom.  I bought this as a music player for my dining and living rooms, and although it's small, it has no problem filling the rooms with great sound.    Pros:  - Great sound in a small package  - listen to music on your network, internet stations, mp3 player, and apps like Pandora and Slacker    Cons:  - Quick-access presets work for only radio and internet radio stations, not Pandora and Slacker  - USB slot would be nice for playing from usb drives    This was the only music player I was able to find that could do all of these things.  While there may be small quirks here and there about how you get to things through the UI, it is way ahead of the competition in terms of what it can do.  Being able to set most things up from your PC once you get connected to your network is very useful.  I would not recommend this to somebody who hasn't used internet radio or apps like Pandora & Slacker, because without that part of it you can pay less for a different player without those features."
1969,4,I bought this player to use near my exercise equipment and in the car when traveling.  It works great for both those uses.  I easily strapped it to my elliptical trainer and watch TV shows and movies from my iPod while I exercise. It even charges my iPod when I'm not watching a show!   We have also used it numerous times while traveling and found the ease of installation and picture quality to be great!    My only complaint is that it doesn't remember where I stopped if I don't get all the way through an episode.  But it easily fast forwards.  That is the ONLY reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5.    The picture quality has been great. It's super easy to strap/install and even has a build in stand to place on a shelf if needed.  I love mine and highly recommend.
1970,5,"Got this one for Xmas. Speaker is much louder than previous generations I've seen. Screen resolution is crisp, movies look grrrreat! 64g is plenty of memory for a large library of music and video. I have approximately 7500 songs, 5 full length movies, 1 season of my favorite T.V. series, and 70 apps (with 3g to spare). Apps are a blast to work with (police scanner, maps, live webcams, games, facebook, reference, tons more). All that's missing is a camera. Maybe next year. With wi-fi in your home, you will find yourself using your cpu/laptop 50% less. If you have the $$ laying around, pick this one up."
1971,4,"I am extremely happy with this receiver. I had an older (3 yrs) Yamaha and this blows it away! Set up was simple and took me all of 20 minutes. The 3 HDMI in's made setting up my BluRay, XBox and Cable a breeze. One HDMI to my TV kept things neat. Picture and sound is perfect. One quick push of a button and you can switch between any device you have, along with the change comes the picture and sound accordingly. A nice addition is the iPod cord.     The system comes with a mircrophone and about 25 ft of cord to calibrate the sound. I set it up and let the system do it's thing. The sound was impressive and better than the way my old receiver was set up. NOTE - There is no on-screen guide if you only have the HDMI running to your TV. Not a big deal, just follow the book and the display on the receiver. The system compensates for speaker placement, room size and even phase on your speakers.    For $270 this is a great deal."
1972,4,"I'm very happy with the Sangean WR-1 AM/FM radio I recently purchased. Its metallic silver face and wood grain cabinet give it a high-quality stereo component appearance. which  looks great on the table near my armchair. More importantly this radio brings in my favorite stations with excellent clarity, a clear warm tone and deep rich bass. I didn't need an external antenna at all, and no more signal drift like I experienced with radios I've used before. An excellent buy."
1973,4,"I bought these and the jBuds J2 during the holiday sale. I was very dissatisfied with the j2's. They were lacking the bass and the highs were really distorted. The Skullcandy Ink'd earbuds have the bass the j2's were lacking and for less than $10. The highs and mids are okay on these out of the box but they are getting better as they are being broken in. I am a big fan of all types of music but I needed some buds that had some bass to satisfy my hip-hop moods. These do the trick. You can't beat them for under $10. As far as quality, they are decent. The wires seems a little flimsy but I can't complain for the price. Just be careful not to tug or put stress on the connection ends too much and they should last longer than you would expect for $10."
1974,1,"Tried to use this product to connect my PC's video card to my TV.  Computer would not recognize the HDMI connection, so it didn't work for me.  Tried to get a replacement but was ignored."
1975,5,"This product was just as seller described, excellent price as well.  These boxes are very hard to find so I am very much appreciative."
1976,5,The converter sets up easily and does a better than average of reproducing the surround sound characteristics from a digital format to an analog audio format.
1977,5,"I've bought AKG products since the 80's and love them all, but if you have a problem, don't ask them for help, they don't care. These little headphones are great with full sound in the high and very deep base. You can use them on any device that has a headphone jack and again, they sound fantastic, the best I've heard music through so far for a small set. The silicone sleeves that come with the headphones are the only ones you can use to get the full sound. When they tear, that's it, the aftermarket type don't work well at all. The sound loss is noticeable right away. No low end and no high end, just the mid-range and it's not pleasant at all. I've contacted just about everyone at AKG except for the President of the company for replacement sleeve tips and they all hand me to someone else who hands me to someone else and round and round it goes. Basically I was told to just buy another pair to get the sleeve tips. At $119.00 each pair and only after having them a month or two, that's a bit extreme. What it comes down to is that if you buy from them, it's now your problem and good luck cause they really just don't care. It's a real shame, because they do make great products. I guess they have such a customer base that to lose maybe hundreds, doesn't  even phase them. There's plenty more people out there to sell to, even if it's only once."
1978,4,Wow this speaker can be loud if you crank it up.  It would be great for parties -- I'm amazed that much sound comes out of it.  I bought this and the X-Mini II Capsule Speaker at the same time.  This one is louder than the X-Mini II with a good amount of bass for its size.  It is smaller than the X-Mini II but it has a slight tinny sound when cranked up.  I prefer the X-Mini II for the overall music quality -- it has a better range between high and low tones -- but there's nothing wrong with this one so I gave it four stars.  Works very well with a netbook and is great for videos.
1979,5,Since I don't have cable I needed to combine two antennas to get all the channels.  It worked.  Now I can enjoy the same channels I had before they became digital.
1980,2,"One of the speakers was blown out upon delivery.  Others had warned these didn't ship well.  The one that worked sounded pretty good, seemed to deliver a full range and decent sound.  Considering it seems to be a low end paper speaker (like what comes stock in many cheaper cars), I was impressed.    I'm worried they won't last.  Returning these and going for the Polk sattelites.  Up towards $100 now, but they should stand the test of time."
1981,2,"First off, this review is based on my experience and not scientific tests.  I purchased 8 of these for use with my Nikon SB-900 and SB-600 flashes.  When they are fresh out of the charger (La Crosse BC9009) they will recycle the flash extremely fast and last for about 150 shots.  However, if I charge them and leave them in my camera bag for a 3 days I'll get about 50 shots.  If I charge them and leave them in my bag for a week, they are stone dead.  Overall, the batteries that were included with my La Crosse charger (Lacrosse 2600's) out perform the Sanyo 2700 by about 2 fold (again, not scientific).  I've been testing a set of 4 Eneloops for about a month and I really like them.  The Eneloops give me more overall shots and hold a charge for considerably longer - there is a small hit on the recycle time, but for me the upsides of the Eneloops outweigh this."
1982,5,"I got them for my husband for his \\""hat lights\\"", and he said that they are working great. He put them in a few weeks ago, and uses them every night for coming out of the woods from hunting, after dark for stoking the outdoor stove, and for numerous reasons. Best of all a GREAT value. We will definately buy them again."
1983,3,"Got my Sanyo R227 Internet radio from Amazon within 4 business days and was ready to rock 'n' roll.  Easy set up and no problems finding stations to listen to.  The sound is super for a clock radio, although I would have liked to see a tone control since the radio is a bit heavy on the bass. Build quality is impressive too.  Compact and heavy; not at all cheap looking.      The bad news is that my radio always lost the WiFi signal within 3 minutes of connecting, thus requiring a reboot every time.  I called Sanyo service  and was met by the most droll, uninterested, tech support man on the face of the earth.  He volunteered no helpful info and answered every question that I asked in the most bored, brief, demeanor imaginable. SANYO, find this unhelpful guy and DUMP him!  Concluding on my own that my radio was faulty, I decided to exchange the radio at Amazon and I'm now awaiting the new radio.  Never one to put all my eggs in one basket, though, I also order an Aluratek radio. I'll keep whichever radio works best!     Got the replacement radio today (10/6) and everything works great.  I'm very impressed with the R227 so far.  I'll be returning the Aluratek to Staples tonight.  It's much smaller than the R227 and doesn't have the quality feel, or appearance of the R227. It couldn't beat this Sanyo R227 as a bedside radio since it has only one speaker.  The Aluratek unit also has a cheap plastic smell. The Sanyo has no odors to overcome.        Buyers of this great Sanyo radio need to be aware that the 8 presets are, thankfully, not the only way to save your favorite stations.  To get many more favorites, you'll merely log on to the Reciva site, enter your radio registration number, and their massive list of Internet stations is quickly at your fingertips. At the Reciva web site you'll select your favorite stations and, then, when you turn on your radio you find them all listed under MY STUFF on your radio's menu. In other words, you can have dozens (hundreds?) of favorites. You may have to reboot your radio to see them. At the moment I have two dozen favorites.       My only complaint as of today (10/7) is the searchlight-bright display in the dark bedroom.  I'll need to find some clingy tint film and put it over the screen. You can adjust the radio backlighting, but it doesn't help.  I'll post more when I find a solution to the light problem.     (10/8 Update) - I went to a window tint store and got some free samples of their various tint films.  Then I cut out a display screen-sized piece of the tint film and laid it on the display window.  No need for any glue; the film clings nicely to the display window.  You'll have to experiment with various degrees of tint to find your preferred one.         Oh, I do have one other problem.  I want to carry this radio everywhere I go!!!!!!!! (and I have XM in the car)"
1984,5,"I purchased this item based on other reviews that I have read. They were all correct. This is a great product, instead of 25, I purchased 50. They are great."
1985,5,"I read many of the reviews for HD indoor antennas and although had reservations, chose the Phillips due to excellent reviews.  I am totally blown away by the high quality of the picture with this antenna;it is not an exaggeration to say \\""picture perfect!\\""  The only negative was that the antenna itself looked like it may have been refurbished, but this did not detract from its' excellent performance in drawing many stations with crystal clear reception."
1986,5,This is my tenth Creative digital player.  I believe that this is the best possible  digital player ever that can be built.  Unless they can make one that's 50 GB and  with speaker that has more bass and battery  life that can go for a week. Without changing  the size. with a built in USB plug.  I also have the Zen and Zen x-fi. and lots  of the Zen Nanos.
1987,4,"These speakers perform remarkably well for their size and price.  Brookstone makes a large, flat speaker which is slimmer than this product, but is mono. These speakers put out meaningfully stereo sound, the hinged speakers allowing for surprisingly sensitive adjustments.  I recommend this product and rate it 4.5 stars."
1988,1,"This is NOT an HD radio. The discription is wrong HD in this case does not stand for High Definition and the product was incorrectly catagorized by Amazon, Please correct. It caused me much inconvenience."
1989,5,"Wow!  This alarm clock exceeded my expectations.  It's easy to program and use and has AMAZING sound for its size, plus it looks great.  The snooze/dimmer button is large and right up front- easy to hit in the middle of the night or in the morning when you want that 5 extra minutes.  I like that you can change the brightness of the display and have the option of completely turning off the light all together.  When the alarm goes off in the morning, the display lights up- a little extra help to get you out of bed.  A few people have said the remote doesn't work from more than 5 feet away- I've found that I can use mine from across the room, so I have no complaints there either.    All in all, this is a great alarm clock at a GREAT price- I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for an ipod compatible alarm clock!  2 thumbs up!"
1990,5,"Work at the Post Office and needed a radio to listen to out on the route all day.  Have had several less expensive radios and they all had reception problems with  AM which is what I mostly listen to.  With my other radios every time I would  turn a corner I was in danger of losing the signal and missing part of what was   being talked about.  I have now had this new PR-D5 about a week and the first  thing I noticed was the reception was great.  The stations I listen to come much  clearer and do not fade in and out with each turn.  Also the size of this radio  was just right to take along with me each day.  Several people at work have already  asked about it and I am sure some of them will be ordering one soon.  As far as  what I do not like about it, not a thing so far."
1991,2,"Long story short, everything works fine with the mouse. But pressing the middle button is much easier from the part of the wheel close to the center than the other. When I need to scroll up the result is that sometimes I mistakenly end up pressing the central button. Since I use a UNIX machine, this means I end up pasting the text in the clipboard in random places, sometimes not even noticing it. It has become annoying. I have never had a similar problem with any other mouse. Sorry Lenovo, but you need to fix this.  I got this mouse at work, so I cannot tell from the technical details if it is exactly the same model (I wished there was something like the ISBN for books, but there is not). Although from the picture I can tell that it looks exactly the same."
1992,5,"This thing is wonderful.  It makes the bass sound big, deep, clear, and rich.  It makes the sound stage seem wider and more three-dimensional.  And it makes the high frequencies seem clearer, so that lyrics are more intelligible and the details of percussion instruments are heard with greater accuracy and clarity.<br /><br />I listened to my car stereo with the iWow on my iPod yesterday, and it was amazing how much better it sounded.  I literally felt like dancing.  My car stereo has small speakers in the doors and modest-sized speakers on the deck behind the rear seats.  In the past, it was always difficult to adjust the balance so the sound from the front and rear surrounded me.  But with the iWow, the broader stereo field made it easy to adjust the balance so I was immersed in big, clear sound.  It was amazing how deep the bass notes go -- hard to believe it was coming out of those modest speakers.  Apparently the iWow achieves this by synthesizing bass harmonics rather than merely cranking up the low frequencies.  So it sounds like louder, deeper bass without overloading the amplifier or speakers.  I bought the iWow for my iPod mainly because I liked the broader and more three-dimensional sound produced by the iWow enhancement to Windows Media Player on my PC.  But with my iPod, the bass enhancement is equally attractive.  I listened to the iPod with the iWow engaged on a 200-mile trip yesterday, and the more I listened to it, the better I liked it.<br /><br />I am not one of those people who wants the bass so loud that it overshadows everything else.  I just want to hear the bass properly balanced with the rest of the music, and on most songs, I wish the bass were louder.  This makes the bass seem like part of the music rather than something vague and indistinct in the background.  On perhaps one song out of 50, the bass is excessive.  But on the other 49 out of 50 songs, it's a huge improvement.  And if you think the bass is too much, you could always use the EQ on the iPod to reduce the bass or simply disengage the iWow by pushing the button on it.<br /><br />Although the iWow effect is not adjustable -- you either turn it on or off -- the effect that it produces is so attractive that this is not really a problem.  I don't ever want to listen without the iWow on my iPod.  It's really that great.<br /><br />I only wish Apple would make the iWow available as a software download so that the external iWow adapter would not be required.  They would sell millions of them!  And of course, I wish the price were lower.  It bugs me that the iPod doesn't sound this good when you buy it.  So even though it's not cheap, and even though having the external unit plugged into the iPod is a bit clumsy, it's well worth it!o reduce the bass or simply disengage the iWow by pushing the button on it.

1993,5,"I'm using this mount for a home theater setup in a multi-purpose room in the basement.  I like the low profile of this mount because I didn't want the projector to hang too low from the 9 foot ceiling to where it would be an eye sore.  Since it is white, it blends well against the white ceiling and with my mostly white Epson 6100UB projector.  I was able to easily install the mount on the ceiling using the 2 supplied screws.  Attaching the projector to the mount was also easy.  It can tilt and roll vertically, but I was able to make some adjustments to the way the projector attaches on to the mount's spider legs to get a little horizontal shift.  This combined with the projector's lens shift allowed me to place the mount off center on the available ceiling I-beam.  The mount can also rotate and removing the projector from the mount for maintenance is easy."
1994,2,"These are comfortable (3 diff sizes cover), sound great and a decent price.  However, after receiving these in early June, it's the end of July and the connection to the plug is failing.  The right side bud only works when the connection is in just the right spot.    Over all, a comfortable bud with very good sound and poor quality."
1995,4,"For about $20, my expectations weren't too high, but this product has done everything the description says it will do.  There's three HDMI inputs on the \\""front\\"" and one output on the \\""back\\"" (front and back distinctions are at your discretion).  Simply hook up your devices and then connect to your upstream television or other video display device.  The box takes care of switching back and forth or you can use the included 3-button remote to manually swap.    It all works perfectly.  The device does take about 30 seconds to notice that my Xbox 360 has been shut down, but I don't know if that's the fault of the box or if the 360 doesn't close off the HDMI port until the final moment."
1996,1,"I was disappointed when I received my radio and it was the wrong item. I ordered what I thought was going to be the Sangean AM/FM/TV Band Radio, which is what the description read. It did not have the description which is listed with the image on this review. However, I was shipped the AM/FM Radio minus the TV Band. I returned it and was happy with my decision after reading other reviews which stated that the TV Band no longer worked due to the Analog change over.I thought since this was a digital radio that the TV channels would work, that is why I wanted to purchase it. Also, when you use the customer service option of putting in your phone number and they call you back, this is very frustrating as you are connected to someone in India who has some kind of device on the phone to try to disguise their accent, not very well I might add. These people are of no help at all as they do not understand anything you are asking about. The man on the phone just kept reading what my packing slip said over & over no matter what I asked him. He had no idea how to help me. I finally hung up and called the 1-866 customer service number and got someone in the U.S. that was friendly and very helpful. Answered all my questions and helped with my return procedures."
1997,4,"Pros: It doesn't make that annoying humming noise when my iPhone (first generation) is connected.  The sound quality is impressive.  The display is large and brightness adjusts.    Cons:  To avoid taking the iPhone out of the case I have to not use any of the included inserts.  I don't know a product that doesn't have this problem but maybe someone will make one soon.  Sometimes the iPhone is connected but I still wake up to the beeping instead of the iPhone music.  To set the alarm/time, you have to use a wheel similar to the wheel on an iPod, unfortunately you have to go minute by minute which makes changes of more that 4 hours a little bit of a chore."
1998,5,"I have a Bose Sound-dock and this Altec-Lansing system. The Bose cost almost three times as much and the box stated that it would work with the iPhone. Guest what? It doesn't, except in \\""airplane\\"" mode (when you insert the iPhone, a warning on the screen states the device is NOT compatible with iPhone and asks if you want to switch to \\""airplane\\"" mode to reduce audio RF interference). Not so for the A-L - it works flawlessly with my iPhone - even my new 3GS.<br /><br />As for sound quality, Bose makes a big deal out of not allowing you to adjust anything but volume, claiming that it most accurately reproduces the sound of the recording. Well, apparently a lot of rap and hip-hop recordings were intended to be \\""light\\"" on the bass, if that is true.<br /><br />The Altec-Lansing has very adjustable bass and treble settings to allow you to customize the sound for the particular type of music being played - and, to my discerning ear, does a better job than the much more expensive Bose.<br /><br />This is a super compact speaker system for your iPod or iPhone and produces surprising sound quality (rather like that promised - but not delivered - by all of those Bose ads on TV). Even better, it truly is compatible with your iPhone.<br /><br />A great price for a great product. You can't go wrong!"
1999,5,"I got this product because my hearing isn't what it used to be and I wanted better sound than I could get from TV speakers.  The product is outstanding on both counts.  A DVD I couldn't understand was crystal clear.  The sound quality is awesome on movies with \\""big\\"" soundtracks.  The range is much farther than specified."
2000,4,"Very pleased with this DVD player. Set up fast and easy.  Only thing I'd like to add would be fast forward and reverse.  You can skip ahead by preset stops - acts if you will - but not frame by frame.  Otherwise, great picture clarity, wonderful sound, easy to use."
2001,2,"I owned them for six months, then they broke.  the portion that you place the eartips on just sheered off.  I'm glad they weren't in my ear when they broke.    the fitment is TERRIBLE.  they will fall out of your ears.  I tried all the buds to no avail.    however, the sound is excellent, the bass is quite rich.  the red cord is pretty unique and sturdy.    I replaced these with the apple in-ear earphones.  these had better bass than the apple's, but the apple has better highs.      if you're looking at these, make sure to take a look at the apple in-ear earphones as well, they're a better value and probably more sturdy."
2002,4,These are pretty good.  I got them to replace some Shure E2C's I left on a plane.  The sound is great.  The carrying case isn't as nice as the Shure's and I'd ideally want a single cord instead of a cord with an extension cord.  But they work well and the price makes them very attractive.
2003,4,[[ASIN:B0013ZAB1Y iLive 2.1-Channel Speaker Bar with iPod Dock (Black)]]    I am extremely happy with this purchase. It has amazing sound for such a low price. It also has nice lines and can be easily mounted to the wall. I prefer it on top of my TV so that I can hear quality  sound when watching a movie. You will be pleased.
2004,5,"This device records audio to a cd. Input may include radio broadcasts , audio cassette tapes or other CD's. You need to be able to hookup these devices to this TEAC recorder.It is easy enough. You may record to a CD-R  (one time) or a CD-RW many times. I record about 1500 hours per year and this purchase replaces the one that lasted about 2 years. All of my original CD_RW's are still functioning after use of 100 to 200 times each. Remarkable!!  My only complaint is the technical help line. They have no idea what they are talking about. They blamed the CD-RW's when the first recorder was breaking. I bought a second set of 10 CD-RW's based on their insistance that I do so. As each new one was unwrapped and lasted 2 or three times, the help line said all you could hope for was five times. They could not accept the possibility that their recorder had worn out.     In spite of that total customer service failure, I purchased a replacement that again works great and still have no CD-RW failures. My entire collection of CD-RW's have come back to life with the replacement. This is a good machine. I recommend it highly"
2005,5,"I am completely satisfied with this prodect.  The price was resonable and the performance is flawless.  I was using a Recoton remote extender and, for some reason, it just wouldn't work in my master bedroom.  This unit works great in my master bedroom.  With the transmitter replacing one of the batteries in the remote controller, it's also easier to use than my Recoton unit.    Also, I don't have to have the receiver directly in front of my DriecTV DVR.  I just have it off to the side and it still works every time."
2006,1,"My Background: University degreed in electonics    (1) Problems:  Excessive popping sounds. Many reasons and theories on the Internet about popping sounds in wireless headphones. After a great deal of trouble shooting, I found that the power on/off switch in the headband was the culprit. The switch and assembly are as designed and manufactured properly HOWEVER, the switch is 'cheap' and momentary, i.e., when a small plunger in the switch is depressed the power goes on; off when the plunger is released. The switch is activated when the headset is put on causing a small slide to depress the plunger when the headband is set onto the head. Yes I did take it apart. I replaced the switch with an external manual operated on/off switch and the popping is gone. The problem is two-fold the provided switch is 'cheap' and the whole headset mechanism must have been designed and tested by a people with large heads full of hair. I wear hat size 7 1/4 and am bald. When the headset is positioned over my ears, the provided momentaty switch barely closes and any motion on my part causes it to turn off/on and pop. REALLY BAD DESIGN.    (2) A tingling shock whenever I picked up the base unit. Plastic case and pretty much DC so why a tingling shock? Yes I took it apart. I found that the component pigtails of the printed wiring board contacted the outer case and that the grounds associated with the RCA jacks connecting the base unit to the TV set were also touching the case. The plastic case is an insulator but is quite prone to electrostatic build up which in turn acts as a conductor between the TV set and itself. Trimming all of the 'long' pigtails solved the shocking problem. Really BAD MANUFACTURE.    I DEFINITELY DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS PRODUCT."
2007,5,"Just purchased this item to serve as an entertainment system for our new vacation home. The stereo is excellent, is easy to use, and has a powerful deep sound that works very nicely for what we needed. The remote control and the fact that it can hold three cds makes it especially convenient as well. I would definitely reccomend this system given it was just under $100. A very good product."
2008,5,"As the Blu Ray / HDTV bug bit me, I had to upgrade to a receiver with HDMI switching. I upgraded from a Rotel receiver which did not support HDMI.    I did quite a bit of research and auditioning before I chose this Denon. The important features for me were HDMI switching (with full support for Dolby TrueHD and the rest of the Blu Ray sound formats) and Audissey room calibration. Since many of us watch movies and listen to music in our regular living rooms which are not specially acoustically treated, room calibration is very useful, and it only became available in receivers a couple of years ago.    Other brands / receivers considered: Integra, Onkyo, Marantz, Pioneer Elite, Yamaha, NAD, Arcam, Rotel, Sony. Of these, Arcam and Rotel do not offer room calibration and yet are expensive, so they were ruled out. Sony, Yamaha, and Pioneer have some proprietary room correction which may or may not be good. I liked the sound of the Pioneer Elite for what is worth. Integra, Onkyo, Marantz and NAD have Audissey RoomEQ, which is the most advanced tried-and-true room correction available in home theater receivers today. The NAD and Marantz feature more limited versions of RoomEQ. Marantz sounds kind of dull and smears high resolution detail; some call this sound \\""sweet\\"" but it really is just dull :) Integra and Onkyo are pretty feature rich and their highest end models are in the same league as this Denon. Integra and Onkyo (which are the same company really) sound detailed and somewhat bright.    Denon won because it has the fullest set of features (you can even listen to web radio or stream your music files over WiFi!), it is network upgradeable unlike most of the other brands (kind of like your PC which gets software updates), has enough power (140 Watts/channel) to drive most speakers, and it sounds fantastic.    This summer Denon is introducing the successor to this and a few other receivers, so prices for this receiver are lower now -- it must be one of the better dealson the market right now in this price range."
2009,3,this product we had purchased 2x due to wires sometimes get tangled    up and knotted. otherwise it is the tops you can get. sony should make    a faster retractor mech. in their tech dept.
2010,1,"Bought this in Nov'08 directly from Creative over the Internet and I was very pleased it initially. However on the 12th Jan it stopped working - the CD player just stopped.  They agreed to replace the unit so I returned it and they sent a 'new' one to me. This didn't work out of the box, it turns out that it was a 'reconditioned' unit that was faulty too.  So i returned that and after much arm twisting they agreed to refund me money.  It is now the 7th May and after 4 months, 20 emails, 2 broken units, several telephone calls, many broken promises and apologizes, I've not yet received my refund.  Forget Sky and NTL, these guys top the poll and are the poster boy of bad customer service.  NEVER EVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM  (I'd give them zero stars but I can't on this website)"
2011,3,Purchased the Onkyo TX-SR606 7.1 end of Oct. 2008.  Shipping from Amazon was great.  Set-up was a little confusing and required a phone call to Onkyo to finish.  Everyone's comments about this receiver being hot were totally accurate.  We have to leave the door open on the cabinet to keep the heat levels down.      Receiver worked great until 5/1/09 when the HDMI output quit working.  Onkyo customer service walked us thru several tests and resets without success.  Our greatest complaint is there are very few authorized Onkyo service centers.  We had to box up the receiver and mail it to NY for repair.  It was mailed (3 day service $45.00) on 5/4/09.  Now the real test is how long it will take to be repaired and returned.    Bottom line...I wouldn't buy this model again.  Until now I've never had a received break or quit working.  I've always replaced an older model with a newer model with more bells and whistles.  I'm curious if anyone else has experienced a problem with the HDMI output.
2012,5,This works great.  I have yet to have a problem with is and use it in every car I travel in.
2013,5,Works very well
2014,4,"Its not for the faint of heart...but if you put in the time, this thing is BRILLIANT.  Here's my thoughts:    - The device takes time to set up.  You have to connect it to your PC, install software, select the devices you have, and synchronize all of the information to both the remote control and the wireless infrared receiver.  Some devices, despite being available in their online database, pull down settings for buttons that don't work quite right or are associated to the wrong buttons (my only disappointment with the Harmony).  It will take some time, but you can basically change any of the buttons to do anything your other remotes can do.  In some cases you have to point an old remote at the Harmony and \\""train\\"" the harmony to perform a specific function.  It's not hard, but it can be time consuming.  In my case I had to train and configure the Harmony and then take it all back upstairs and test my changes and then bring it all back down and change what I didn't like over and over until I got everything the way I wanted it.  Think of it as an investment.  I'm not sure how they could make it better, so I don't count the work as a problem with the device.    - After all the setup is done.  This thing is SWEET.      - No more 5 remote juggling and searching.      - We can now keep our cabinet doors closed (because this thing talks wirelessly, like your laptop to your wireless router, to an infrared transmitter which sends signals to the entertainment system components which no longer have to be \\""in sight\\"" of the remote) so the family room looks nicer.    - The kids can use the Harmony and always get what they want.  If they want to play Wii, they just press \\""Play a Game\\"" and it turns everything on, changes the video source, changes the audio sources...the only thing it won't do is put their favorite game in the Wii console.  If, when they push \\""Play a Game\\"", something doesn't turn on or switch to the right source the kids can press HELP and the device will fix the problem...ALWAYS!...and its friendly enough to ask if everything is OK now.  They love it!  No more do they yell through the house for me to come change everything so they can play a game or watch a cartoon.    - It was expensive, but the sheer brilliance of it made it worth every penny (make sure you order it online you can save over $100 as compared to a brick and morter store).  If you have a lot of components and are always frustrated by remotes or if you really, really want to hide those components so they aren't always seen this is the device for you."
2015,3,"Good at low volume, battery life is ok. feels kinda cheap. good for a small office or when traveling."
2016,5,"These are excellent earplugs for those situations where you want to hear well - but softer.  I've been wearing them for several years playing in symphonic ensembles - I can hear myself better with than without them - and I can hear everything around me well without any distortion (no changes in pitch, etc.)  I also wear them in noisy auditoriums and at the movies (they are too loud these days also!).  I bought a pair for my wife (not a musician) and she loves them also-"
2017,1,"They sell identical items under different names! They have same one for 3.95 under different name. I ordered both for a friend and didn't pay attention. When my order arrived, items were identical and they charged me 3.95 for one and 19.95 for exactly same one. After closer look at amazon web site, I noticed they DO sell identical items under different names! So it wasn't a mistake. That's why I didn't pay attention. I have contacted them twice and offered  to return me price difference and forget about it. All I got was standard answers offering to return both. Makes a LOT of business sense. :) I don't think this company does any good to Amazon's reputation. STAY AWAY."
2018,4,"The item works well.  I needed to purchase adapters for the antenna connections because GM uses a different size.  I got the adapter at a local auto store for ~$15.    The sound quality is on par with radio reception (which is what it is) and it is much better than a cassette adapter.  It works best when the iPod volume is turned up to almost the maximum so that noise is not amplified.    The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the AM reception for normal radio listening seems to have more static with the device installed.    FYI, it can be a challenge to install in some cars.  I put mine in the glove box and ran the wires for antenna and power through a hole that I drilled in the back of the glove box.  But it is a fun DIY project if you have a few hours and are handy with tools."
2019,1,"The speaker are Cr-p. They say they work at 150 feet. They don't work 15 feet. POOR SOUND, FADE, BREAK UP. SOMEBODY MUST HAVE PAID SOMEONE TO WRITE POSSITIVE ABOUT THESE. I MADE THE MISTAKE OF BELEIVING WHAT WAS WRITTEN AND BOUGHT A THIRD SPEAKER AT THE SAME TIME. IT'S GOING BACK ALSO. I HAVE NEVER WRITTEN A BAD REPORT, BUT THESE ARE THE WORST! TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!"
2020,5,"We just got back from Ireland.  This Garmind UK and Ireland City Navigator SD card turned out to be essential to the enjoyment of our trip.  It is more difficult than you can imagine, to sit in the right side of the car, driving on the left side of extremely narrow and twisting roads, including round-abouts (like a rotary, but going in the opposite direction) with multiple exits, and few street name signs.  If we had been using paper maps, it would have been very difficult, as there were few shoulders on the roads, so there would have been no place to pull over to look at a map.  A few times I did pick a wrong road, when the Garmin was running just a hair behind on the map, from where we physically were, but it immediately corrected the error.  We never got lost, whether we were driving in a larger city, or on almost a cow path in the country side.  This probably saved us some arguments about getting lost, and certainly reduced the stress in navigating.    At times the Garmin was slower than normal to load maps and find satellites, but no matter that the sky was normally cloudy, it did work.  However, we did find that the POI's were severely lacking, and even some of the towns did not exist on the Garmin.  Even so, just for the ease in navigating, it was worth it.  So order one of these SD cards and take your trip in confidence.      PS. the Guinness Beer is much better than any Guinness you can get on tap in the United States.  Also, the pubs are the place to do your eating.  The atmosphere is quaint, and the food is hardy and reasonably priced.  Have a great trip."
2021,1,"While this unit looks pretty nice, the kind of performance one would expect from a three thousand dollar system just is not there.  A system that sounds better then this can be had at a fraction of the cost.    Ended up returning this for a Denon AVR-3808CI and Polk Audio Speakers at about half the cost and could not be happier."
2022,4,"This was a great deal. It fits my Sansa Fuze perfectly and the sound quality is pretty good. The bass becomes a little distorted a the highest volume and the wire atenna on the back is annoying, but those would be the only two negatives. The device also charges the Sansa which is great. Good product!"
2023,5,"This is the 2nd pair of these headphones that I have owned.  I bought my first pair 3 years ago.  I've tried others, but these are the most comfortable for my ears.  Great for running!"
2024,4,"Despite the other 1 and 2 star reviews, I bought one. I'm pretty happy with it and recommend it to someone who wants a little more than the standard portable sw radio and doesn't want to spend a lot more money for an expensive table top. I get stations from all over the world with just the provided telescopic antenna. When I hook up a homemade (piece of copper wire!)antenna, it performs closer to an expensive tt than a portable sw. It's got some great tuning features that portables don't have. If you have one and have trouble, get a better antenna. If that doesn't work, return it, you may have a bad unit. Grundig's pretty cool about that. Also, get the 2009 \\""Passport To Worldband Radio\\"" book to help find more stations and get some good tips. I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if possible.  P.S., Amazon, it's called the \\""Satellit\\"", not a satellite."
2025,5,The pods fit perfectly into my daughters ears.  She was unable to use traditional earbuds.  The noise protection is a wonderful feature to protect little ones ears.
2026,1,"You get what you pay for.  The unit was shipped in a non-padded envelope and arrived slightly damaged.  The docking pin was bent.  After adjusting it to where I thought it was aligned properly (straight) and docking the shuffle, the pin snapped off and became lodged in the shuffle.  Only after many attempts with a paper clip was I able to dislodge the broken pin from the unit.    Never again."
2027,4,"Let's get this straight:  these are the best ear buds in the marketplace in terms of sound quality. Deep, clear bass, great tonal quality, and the latest revisions are compatible with 1st gen iphone's recessed jack.  But they are ear buds nonetheless.  It's close to impossible to design buds that will fit snuggly and comfortably in 100% of the potential buyers.  On top of that, I've never had earphones last more than a year of constant use. They're just too fragile (I'm now on my third pair)(d'oh). That's where Bose's price point becomes the damning factor, if you can justify paying $100 for these once will you then be willing to buy replacements at a regular interval?"
2028,5,"I bought the Polk Audio Surroundbar 360 theater system to work with my 50\\"" Panasonic 1080 Plasma. The bar by itself sounds good but doesn't have very good sounding bass so I also purchased a Polk PSW-111 powered subwoofer to go with the system to give it that rich deep bass it was lacking. Now I have an amazing system in a small package without a bunch of speakers mounted to the walls and cables running everywhere. The hookup took about 1/2 an hour including taking my time to mount my soundbar on the wall above the plasma tv and routing my cables."
2029,4,"Ink came on time, good thus far for regular printing. Have no complains. Good price also."
2030,5,This small very sleek box is the best thing that has come out for HD TV. It extends your HDMI port to 3 additional. It will blow away any other HDMI Switcher currently even XtremeMac which was a good product but I ordered one from Amazon and it was a piece of garbage and didnt power on and then they sent me another and that one didnt power on. I exchanged it for this item and it works great with all my components. You wont go wrong with this one!
2031,5,Earth shattering sound and dynamic bass that makes the bose systems out there sound like kazoos. Why spend more than the price of dinner at ruby tuesday on a surround sound system? My colon is still bleeding.
2032,5,"I use this on a shelf in my office.  It is a great space saver, very good sound, plays CD's that my old boom box would not play.  (My only wish is that it had a remote so I could adjust volume control without getting up but the exercise is good for me, I suppose.)  I can highly recommend this product!"
2033,5,"A friend has a docking station with speakers for his Sansa but this one is much better sound and quality. I bought it so that when I visit friends, I can share listening to music with them without having to split the earpiece or download to their system. It performs nice background music and the sound output and quality I think are very good.<br /><br />It really serves its purpose."
2034,4,"I recently bought this system [ASIN:B001EWEXOC Sony BDVIS1000 5.1Ch Blu-ray Disc/DVD Home Theater System] to replace a very old first generation system I put together about 10 years ago which included a Marantz SR4000 AV Surround Receiver, a Panasonic S52 DVD/CD player, JBL J2060 series front speakers, a Technics SB-C22 series center speaker, Infinity Sterling Series 2001 rear speakers, and a JBL PSW1000 series subwoofer.<br /><br />I liked the idea of a Receiver/Blu-ray player all-in-one system.  I<br />was also intrigued with (and a bit wary of) the wireless S-AIR rear speaker technology.  I ordered the system on line and when it arrived I was very pleased at how quick and easy it was to set up and connect.  But as feared, I had no luck in getting the wireless rear speakers to work.  (By the way, they're not totally wireless.  Although no wires need to be run from the main receiver, each rear speaker must be connected via speaker wire to the S-AIR surround amplifier, which itself must be placed near the rear speakers, be plugged into an electrical outlet, and have an unobstructed signal view line to the main receiver unit.  That was OK with me since I could place the small amplifier on a lamp table next to my sofa and hide the rear speaker wires connected to the amplifier behind my sofa located in the back of my living room.)<br /><br />The \\""paring operation\\"" that must be performed in order to wirelessly connect the rear speakers with the main unit via a radio signal transmission was very frustrating and failed every time I attempted it.  I ended up calling Sony's Customer Service and spent about an hour and a half on the phone with a representative trying to get the speakers to sucessfully \\""pair\\"" and work properly - to no avail.  By the way, there's no way to \\""hard wire' the rear speakers to the main unit.  After trying everything possible the representative said that he was going to send me a \\""signal booster\\"" cable (Sony part #: EZW-EC10) that I could attach via the wireless transceiver slot on the back of the main unit.  To say the least, if this booster cable didn't work I was ready to pack the system up, ship it back, and look around for a different system!  I received it in a couple of days, hooked it up (very easy) and presto!, I was able to sucessfully perform the \\""paring operation\\"" and receive a strong signal between the speakers and the main unit.  The speakers now work fine and sound great!  I don't know why Sony doesn't include the signal booster cable in the box with the system!  It would save alot of time and frustration for someone who is having trouble getting the rear speakers to work.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very pleased with the performance of this system.  I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for the frustrating rear speaker problem.  But after being corrected, the resulting sound from the 5 tiny speakers and subwoofer is awesome and powerful!  I believe wireless technology in surround sound systems needs further refinements.nsceiver slot on the back of the main unit.

2035,5,"Once you figure this player out, it is actually very easy to use. People get stuck because you have to do things like hit pause before you push the menu key. They need a good MP4 for dummies to show people how to use the unit. Once you figure it out, I think it is a LOT of fun for the money. My wife and son are all excited. I download the video with a one click downloader. Public domain of course :) Then the program comes with a very easy to use converter. After that you just move the file from your computer to the player and your good to go. My wife got stuck because she tried to play the \\""music\\"" but I explained to her she had to go to video and play the video. Soon she began to understand how easy they are to use. But they are small. They only hold 520 MB, that is around 50 3 min videos. Or around 100 MP's. Also Sony is not that much more and you get a lot more battery and a lot more GB's with Sony. They say that the unit is 4 MB but that is Mega BITS not Bytes. I think it is a great toy, a lot of fun and fairly decent quality. But be careful, don't leave it pluged into your computer or you may start to have problems with your USB. Better to unplug it after you download the files and use the wall outlet to charge the battery. The conversion software is great. Very easy to use and will do a bunch of files at once. There is a lot of Christian and worship music in the public domain that is free and you can distribute and share it all you want. This could be a great missionary tool to distribute sermons and worship videos. Of course they will be a lot better when they put in a memory card slot, to get over the memory problem of only 3 hours of video and 6 hours of music. Some of them are already putting a memory card reader on them."
2036,5,"Quick and simple - the Zune 8 GB player is amazing and trouble-free.  I understand there were rough spots with the earlier software etc but Zune 3.0 is clean, easy to fire up and has a wonderful interface.  My son bought this with collected holiday money (lucky guy) and couldn't be more pleased.  I'm jealous of course - he (13 yr old) figured out the software quickly and is delighted with all the features.  (While I sit over at my computer trying to get media to sync correctly with my other-brand player...)    My son made his own choice after comparing with the Nano 8 GB and the similar Sansa and Sony products, and I think he made the right call.  Music & video quality are wonderful and all the on-screen tools easy to manage.  Battery life seems very good.  I would recommend getting a hard shell/case for the device just as with all these smaller players."
2037,4,I bought this for my 11 year old daughter and she hasn't taken it off since we received it.  Downloading songs is a sinch and she has no problem navigating through the screens to get to where she wants to go.  All I had to do was show her how to turn it on.  I want one myself!
2038,5,This was recommended option for a radio with Aux option.  Has exceeded our expectations (delivery by Computer Brain as well).  Purchased second unit as a result of positive  experience.  Biggest drawback has been too many stations rec'd (even without antenna extended)!
2039,5,Good experience.  Product was exactly what I thought I was ordering and the service was very good.  Will use them again.
2040,5,I bought my ZEN Stone 2GB MP3 about a month ago. It's nothing fancy but it works great. The head phones are made for LARGE ears.It loads music and plays.That what I wanted and that what it does....
2041,3,"I purchased the Sonic Boom alarm to wake my teenage son who can usually sleep through any other alarm.  This usually wakes him up, but then he turns off the alarm and goes back to sleep. I'm thinking of moving it to where he can't reach it from the bed."
2042,5,"I bought this turntable for my partner and she just loves it.  She already has over 50 of her vinyls transferred to cds.  She says, it's one of the best gifts, I have ever bought her."
2043,4,"I got an ipod nano 3rd gen. as a gift a few weeks ago, and was wanting to find a good clock radio/dock at a good price.  Well, this IS a good value for the price, if you don't have the problems I had (&still have) with it. First though, It's got great sound -- I've heard more expensive speaker systems that don't deliver nearly the sound quality of this one.  I like the little adjustable back brace for the ipod, I don't have to worry with getting it into the dock right.  It seems to charge the ipod fairly rapidly, although I do leave it on the dock overnight anyway.  I love the remote.  Even though I'm not sitting that far away from it when using it, it's still nice to be able to point and click.  The remote gives you full access to all the ipod functions, and is easy to figure out how to use (even for someone like me who isn't very electronics friendly.    The big downside -- this thing is very particular about the order you do things to set the alarm.  I've had this thing for 2 or 3 weeks and I still set another clock as a back up, 'cause half the time the alarm doesn't go off on this thing.  The ipod has to be on the dock before you set the alarm, and you have to go through steps in a particular order or the alarm won't go off at all.    Value for the price, ignoring the alarm problems, I'd give it an A.  Sound quality I'd give it an A+, as this unit really delivers.  But sony really needs to re-think how you set the alarm and make that a little more workable for those of us that aren't electronics genuises!"
2044,5,"While there is nothing exciting about audio extension cables, this one comes close.  It has a great feel to it, and what seems like heavy duty metal ends.  The cable has a soft, flexible feel to it. It also seems imposable to tangle, which is great.  Great buy!"
2045,4,"I bought the JBL On Tour just before leaving on a cruise.  The product worked great.  Its \\""clam shell\\"" design makes it easy to pack and keeps the speakers protected from damage.  One feature I like a lot is that it can be powered using the supplied power cord, or by four double-A batteries.  My wife and I plugged our iPods into the On Tour and had a great time listening in our cabin aboard ship.  The sound quality is quite good, but definitely not great.  If you are looking for something with really great bass response, this isn't going to do it, but if you aren't an audiophile and just want to listen to music and other audio casually, you'll be happy with the JBL On Tour."
2046,1,I purchased this player to be able to take it with me on the bicycle.  It works fine if it is perfectly still on a table.  As soon as it is moved it begins to skip.  Even moving it from table to table will cause it to skip. It surely won't work while riding the bike.
2047,1,"The item pictured is the original Discwasher system. The item you get is the new one from RCA with a different handle and completely different material on the business side. And the new item is vastly inferior to the original. This used to be one of the best products out there, now I'm looking for other, better record cleaning solutions."
2048,4,"good sound, handy item if you have a hard of hearing person in the house."
2049,5,"The product performed exactly as claimed.  The included batteries and various adapters can appear confusing in pictures and descriptions, but once you have everything in front of you it all makes perfect sense.  The base station includes a built-in charger for the mini-batteries, which is very convenient.  I used mine to allow me to locate a small LCD TV on my patio, but leave the bulky Verizon cable box in place in the kitchen (I use a coax extension cable for the TV signal).  Using this device allowed me to change channels from 30' with an exterior wall between the TV and the box.  Great bargain, highly recommended."
2050,3,"I gave this a 3 because of my use of it. I love the remote control function, but it does not fit if the iPod is inside a case and since I don't like  to remove my iPod from it's case, this doesn't get much use. but the product does work like it's supposed to. I also have a laptop with iTunes so I just use the cable from my stereo to my laptop and play it like that. For people who don't have a computer or a laptop, and have just an iPOd, this is a great product to own."
2051,2,"I just received my V-Moda ear plugs.  I purchased them based on the rave reviews but I guess you get what you pay for.  I tried them immediately and first noticed how comfortable they were.  Then I plugged them into my iPod Classic.  First, I had to crank up the volume all the way.  Then, I couldn't believe how cheap and tinny the sound was.  I listened to Wasis Diop's 'Everything is Never Quite Enough' a good tune for rich textures, overlays and, of course, bass.  I couldn't believe my ears. Plugged my old earplugs back in, the ones that came with the iPod, and had to lower the volume.  Sure enough, it wasn't my imagination.  The difference is unbelievable.  A transistor radio compared to a symphony hall.  Save $20.  Find something else."
2052,5,"I use my tape recorder to Play Learning Tapes for my Sweet Adelines Group, and I also use it to record Homeowners Association Meetings.  It is so easy to use, play, replay, change the speed and volume, it is the best cassette recorder I've owned.  I have recommended this product to friends that were in the market for a recorder."
2053,4,"So, my dell Jukebox finally gave up after almost five years of excellent service.  This time I have decided to go with Microsoft's Zune 80GB.  I have read some pretty good things about this player.    First, what I don't like:  To be honest, I'm disappointed with sound quality.  I knew they gave up equalizer, but even my old dell with equalizer Off sounded much better. The sound is so flat, no depth at all. High tones don't exist, bass sucks. I can't believe there is no way to fix this. Even with expensive earphones you can't compare Zune's sound quality to five year old Dell. (?!)  Shame on you Microsoft. Why don't you update firmware and give us a nice four band equalizer.    There is not much in the box.  Everything must be purchased extra, including protecting or caring case and travel charger.    Battery Indicator is very inaccurate-after calibration seems to work fine though-but why do I have to recalibrate a brand new unit?    Now, what I like about Zune 80GB.  Nice crisp screen, good quality video (if you need it), easy to operate pad and FM radio option (how about AM Radio in next Zune?), 80GB storage for nice price.    Would I recommend this player?  For $250-Yes, but if you expect high quality sound-you'll be disappointed like me!"
2054,5,"Absoltely excellent product, does exactly what it's supposed to, and does it very well. It carries my 32-inch LCD HDTV easily, holds it in front of the cabinet/shelf that my old CRT Standard TV used to occupy. It's mounted on the side panel of the cabinet, and allows the entire TV to swing out like a door, so I can store DVD's and other miscellany in that immense cabinet behind the new TV.  Appears to be very strong, could probably carry twice the weight of that 32-incher with little problem."
2055,4,"I purchased the Zen 16GB player to replace my hard-drive based Cowon iAudio (30GB).  The iAudio has great sound and a decent video screen, but twice in 2 years the headphone jack became disconnected from the circuit board, so instead of spending another $75 for repairs it was time to replace.    LOOKS: The Zen is tiny!  Easily a smaller footprint than a credit card, but thicker - as you would expect of something with electronics and a battery.  The screen takes up the bulk the the face, there is only room for the buttons on the right edge.  The finish is a very nice, shiny black plastic that has a nice feel to it.    PERFORMANCE: You need to load the software that comes with the Zen to manage transfers from the desktop to the Zen.  I prefer to drag-and-drop files, but the Zen was not recognized without the software.  Transfers seemed slower than with my iAudio, but acceptable.  Once on the Zen, data cannot be accessed as if using the desktop file explorer.  It is very itunes-like - choose by album, artist, play list, etc.  My work-around was to make all my non-album collections into Zen play lists via the Creative software on the desktop.  Battery life is good, I haven't run any stress-test to determine range, but so far so good.    The sound is good, with a number of preset equalizer settings as well as a customizable one and bass boost.  The volume has a range higher than I'll ever need, and is easily controlled by the 4 way buttons on the face.  Video is created by running the Creative converter and runs smoothly on the vibrant screen.      SUMMARY: This is a nice little mp3/video player at a good price.  I've enjoyed it for the month I've had it.  Immediately buy a screen protector and a case to protect the gloss finish of the Zen.  I got a 3rd party silicone case with a belt clip and it does the job nicely."
2056,5,For the money you will not find any thing that sounds like these things do. Great bass. GET THEM!
2057,1,"Unless you are a firewall expert, you will need support from Logitech to install the unit and get it running.  Unfortunately, their support hours make it very difficult for someone on the west coast to get support.  At 9 AM to 7 PM, a normal working person would have less than one hour a day of coverage.     I wouldn't buy the unit with Logitech's current commitment to customer support."
2058,4,"The mount itself is well made, good finish, nice end caps, good variety of hardware, pretty good instructions in the 'for dummies' format, and a helpful template for levelling the bracket and drilling holes.  My biggest problem was my old house and finding studs around the fireplace area through the plaster. However, finally got the mount bolted down, and got a friend to help lift Samsung 52\\"" onto the bracket ... checked things out, no problems, put retention bar into locked position, put a padlock on one end, Done. Now that I've done this, I'd feel comfortable mounting a TV again.     The included CD would not play. I suspect a whole bunch of these were thought to have 'burned' but didn't.  Too bad, was looking forward to viewing it, and I bought the Bell'O specifically to learn.  It's a good product."
2059,1,"Did not like this product. ear buds are big, no cushions and hard to keep in your ears. Would not buy this again."
2060,4,"Pros: High and mid-range sounds from the cubes are very crisp, especially during gaming. System has a good all-round sound for the xbox 360, dvds and for music but fall short of excellent. The cubes deliver an amazing sound volume for their size and look great on the top of the piano.     Cons: Bose should make it clear that the bass module is not a powered sub-woofer. It does not deliver any where near the lows of a powered sub. This did not matter to me because I planned to add a sub anyway. Bass module is not all that easy to hide.     Other Thoughts: I've read many negative reviews about these (positive as well). I would rate them an 8.5 to 9 on a scale of 10. I played with these quite a while during set-up. Wiring, placement and amp quality are huge variables with this system. If the buyer expects subwoofer lows from the bass module, it won't happen. The bass module is not easily driven, a weak, low current amp won't adequately drive it. I replaced inferior speaker wire with high quality Monster Cable and it made a significant improvement. Lastly, the bass module provides PLENTY of (non-sub) bass when wired and placed correctly."
2061,4,I like this mp3 player I can shuffle all the songs or just a gengre and it will down load a ton of pictures.  Not to hard to understand to work.  I had a Zen 2GB before it went though the wash but I could not shuffle any songs.  The head phones that came with the Zune were hard to stay in my ears when I worked so I used my old head phones which still worked after going though the wash.  My 15 year old son set up the whole system which was nice of him so I had to do was play the music.
2062,5,works like it's supposed to and at a price that beats down the local retailers inflated junk.
2063,1,"No MP3, No USB, the name of the baddiest company lot of money for poor features, hate it!"
2064,1,It worked well for the first few months but then the left channel started getting static in it and soon went dead. It shouldn't have gone bad so quickly. I'm using a Pioneer receiver that is pushing 10 years in age and it still works beautifully. I don't know if I just got a lemon or not but I won't be buying another.
2065,1,I actually like the design but the software is giving me problems and the Samsung troubleshooting support is almost non-existent.  My current problems include not being able to transfer video to it (or finding any sort of video conversion to work as the help and user's guide show)  and actually scrambling the titles for tracks when ripping CDs.     Also the subscription service is unavailable in the US and at least for me I had no indication of that until I started trying to use it.    I really wish I bought another player.
2066,4,"[[VIDEOID:20189191]][[ASIN:B000C1Z0HA Next Generation Remote Control Extender]]<br /><br />I had a need to remote control my TiVo HD and DVD player that are located inside a closed cabinet. I tried to use an inexpensive RF remote control but I hated the remote and there is a significant amount of lag when I push the button on the remote.  Sometimes the component didn't register the command at all.  Very frustrating.<br /><br />I did a little more research on how to control my components that were hidden inside this cabinet and I ran across this Next Generation Remote Control Extender.  At first I thought this was the same thing as those stupid X-10 Pyramid remote extenders or IR repeaters, but as I read more about it I realized this was something different.  In short, this system will allow you to convert your standard remote into a powerful RF remote.  This is a very unique solution.<br /><br />I used this system to convert my favorite Logitech/Harmony 676 universal remote into a RF remote that can control my TiVo HD and DVD player  while hidden out of sight in my cabinet.  It totally works and there no lag from when I push a button to the action on the screen.  Love it!!!"
2067,2,"I was very disappointed in the company.  They advertise it as compatible with Ipods and that it will charge them while in use.  They don't tell you that it will not charge the latest Ipod models and that to even use it with them you have to purchase an additional item (which turned out to be a small piece of foam tape).  Since I needed to use the boom box and Ipod where I did not have access to a computer, I had to purchase a separate Ipod charger."
2068,5,I really enjoy using the clear lightsphere. it provides a great lighting for my photography.  This is a very good price for the product that i'm getting.  It also came with an instructional dvd that was nice as well.  most of the items i already knew but it was nice.
2069,1,"The product was described as accomodating Sony video cameras.  Well, I couldn't begin to pack my Model DCR-TRV480 into the opening.  I'll be returning the item for full refund.  Caveat emptor when buying a supposedly compatible accessory without SPECIFICations!"
2070,3,Overall this is a pretty good antenna with the exception that is will not clear up VHF channels 3 & 9 other than that it is a decent item. It might be because they are about 65 miles away.
2071,5,Words cannot describe this sub woofer! It is by far the best sub money can buy. It is truly amazing to hear and feel the output of this sub. I do not know why Yamaha stopped making it but it is just truly amazing. The power that this baby puts out even with volume up only 30 percent is incredible! All I can say is that if you get your hands on one of these you will have to consider yourself lucky as can be. There is no way you can go wrong with this sub. Truly a masterpiece of Yamaha and an extreme asset to any home theater!
2072,5,This product was priced low and shipped fast.  It works well to replace the one that I lost that came with my Zen W.
2073,1,"These disks are not worth your time.  Every one i've used from the spindle so far has given me trouble.  The first one wouldn't format properly and couldn't rewrite, the second formatted but the recording quality was almost unwatchable since the rewrite, and on and on.  I don't know why they suck, i just know that they do."
2074,4,"This is a truly plug and play solution.  No drivers, no software, no special media players, nothing.  Plugged them in - one to my laptop via USB and one to my old Bose 501 system via 3.5mm stereo jack.  Boom - everything works, everything sounds OK.  Played my Yahoo Launchcast, played my Windows Media Player, no problems.  My only complaint is why aren't the remotes RF?  Why would you use IR remotes on something that you should be able to tuck away and never see again?  That said, the RF remote on my Bose stereo is all we really need.  After playing with it a while, I broke out the instructions to make sure I wasn't missing anything cool.  Nope, nothing to miss, the whole process took me about 5 minutes and 4.5 of them were to unpack the thing.  I use this system for the Muzak in our showroom, and to rock out when we are closed.  I'd highly recommend this system to anyone wanting to broadcast your computer music to your stereo remotely."
2075,5,"Comparing the price of this cable with the official one, I almost didn't believe it was going to work perfectly. But, the first time i booted my Wii with it, the image was perfect: great video quality with no interference (there are 5 tv antennas around my apartment, so the problem with interference here is huge).<br />It is really reinforced, the plug is golden, the white color gives a nice touch, and it came without any scratch (the box is quite resistent).<br /><br />I really recommmend it."
2076,5,"OK, I am not rich, but I have tried most of the different earbuds for my iPod that cost less than 100 dollars:  Sony Fontopia, Sennheiser, Smoking Buds, Shures, etc.  These are different and I love them in a number of ways:    1. They are comfortable (but a little weird).  The actual IN EAR earbuds were starting to chafe my ear canals and give me an unpleasant burning sensation.  Not good.  These Bose phones sit outside the ear canal, possibly similar to the old, lousy iPod phones, but they have a nice plastic tube that extends slightly into your ear to project the sound.  They are very comfortable, although I strangely am using the Small sleeves after using the Large sleeves on all the other earbuds.  They do take some getting used to, as they frequently FEEL like they are about to fall out, but when you check them to adjust, they are in pretty tightly.    2.  They have excellent sound.  I am not at all a sound expert, but the richness of the tones of Norah Jones using these phones almost moves me to tears.  However...  These phones do not blast sound, I had to turn up my iPod volume limit and in crowded areas, I need to pretty much crank up the sound to hear clearly.  But, in a quieter area, these yield incredible sound.    3.  These phones are NOT noise canceling.  As the buds are not completely lodged into your eardrum, you can still hear sounds around you, making these a little safer for running, exercising, etc.  In addition, you can actually hear yourself talk with these phones on, so you aren't constantly yelling at people because the only thing you can hear is your music.    4.  The package came carefully packed with lots of goodies, which I appreciate.  There is a really nice and useful zipper carrying case that exactly fits my iPod, emblazoned with the BOSE logo on the face.  They include a rather handy little clip for attaching your cord to your shirt, so that your buds don't get yanked out of your ears if you bend too far in the wrong direction.  Thereis also a small lanyard for attacking to the cords to keep them in place in the event of strenuous exercise.  In short, lots of little things that Bose could easily have left out, but didn't.    All in all, I could not be happier with my new headphones.  They are the perfect pair for me, and maybe you too!"
2077,4,"We bought a different brand of speakers that had great reviews but they were quite tinny and didn't have a well rounded sound, so we went to a brick and mortar store and tried some JBLs.  These here were the same price as the cheaper model at the other store, so we bought these.  Because they have more of a bass range, they have a better, more well rounded sound than the ones we tried in the store.  We have only one set of speakers for our tv/stereo system and these are working quite well for us.  I think they are the best you'll find for the size and work well as a stand alone set.  If you want better sound, I feel you would need to buy a surround sound system or huge floor speakers."
2078,4,"I read most of the reviews posted here before my purchase and I learned a lot, so will focus on points not made before. I was also disappointed that there weren't more inputs, but solved the problem using an external input selector (4 channels) for seldom used inputs from obsolete media (audio cassettes, record turntable, CD jukebox, etc). I was even more disappointed that there is no switched AC outlet, but i am an engineer so designed and built a device that senses current and turns on an outlet to power the subwoofer amp, etc. Customer service is not the best. I submitted several questions through their website and they answered 1 of 4 adequately. Then a different person wrote that I need to talk to them in person. After a long wait, I got through and he could answer two more questions, but said he can tell me neither whether or not it should nor why my DVD player's HDMI works directly to the TV, but not through the JVC amp. I would need to take it to an authorized JVC shop to be checked out. Dreading disconnecting the rats nest of input and output cables, I worked around the problem using component video. I'll likely get blue-ray soon anyhow. It does not downconvert, so if you use a higher-level input like HDMI, nothing comes out of the conventional output jacks that you would expect to connect to a VCR or DVD recorder.    That's it for the negatives. It's performance has been superlative. It's low height was a major advantage because my cabinet only has 6.25\\""height. I added a small, quiet DC muffin fan to draw air from the left side and top towards the rear and it runs cool. The auto calibration works very well. The USB input does work from a Mac, though they said it's not supported. The wireless USB also works, but I have some interference issues with 2 airports in the same room. I am still optimizing the channel selections to minimize interference. You can select any of 13 channels using a button on the transmitter, but there is no way to tell which channel it is on. It works well with a logitech universal remote. The manual is OK once you learn it's structure and add a few tabs. Overall, I am very pleased and only the negatives mentioned in the first paragraph kept it from getting all 5 stars."
2079,5,The color (Screen) is stunning and better than the previous iPod nano. Also the thin design is a plus. I would recommend getting a case for it because the back tends to scratch.
2080,5,Works great extended watch time for my portable dvd player so I can watch at least 3 movies now
2081,4,"They sound great for 20 bucks including s&h ( Amazon ). Very light weight for full coverage. In the past I've owned Koss Pro4s, Sennheisers, other Sonys. Now I don't have a golden ear, but these measure up to those well enough. Especially for 20 bucks.    One negative though.  Stupid music/movie control. Accurate audio reproduction shouldn't need gimmicks like this. I can tweak it the way I want it with an EQ."
2082,5,"I have always preferred Sony's headphone presentation and sonic signature so I guess you can say this will bias my opinion. But it is only bias if your prejudice favors one manufacturer compared with another in a way considered to be unfair. Well Sony needs to be arrested for not playing fair. I don't know what went into building these headphones but they are amazing. I have been listening to the SA5K for 6 months. I regularly rotate back and forth between my AKG 701 and Beyer 880 but only the Sony makes me part of the music.  These are headphones that rely on a quality source, strong amp to deliver the gourmet sounds. The fit is very comfortable which is important for extended listening. I also own it's big brother, Sony Qualia 010, which is the only headphone I found more comfortable and transparent than the SA5K. If you have never owned a Sony headphone, go out and get this pair...these are among their best and will reach legendary status like the Sony R-10, CD-3000 and the Q010 when they are no longer available."
2083,4,"The Harmon Kardon AVR 247 has been nothing short of fantastic.  Easy to setup, and even more easy to understand.  I love this product, and would certainly recommend."
2084,5,I purchased this for my wife to consolidate half a dozen other remotes each of which only controlled some units of out stereo/TV system.  We bought this instead of the more capable looking but more poorly reviewed 1000 model. It took our computer savvy GenX son about 30-40 minutes to get everything going (he thinks it would take 15 min a 2nd time).  The Harmony 880 works great and flawlessly - controls everything smoothly and simply.  No problems with the charger as others have commented on.  Excellent product.
2085,5,"Sound Quality:  It is significantly better than the several 2.1 systems (for pc) I used before. The sound is warm, crisp, deep and calm. It does not create a dramatic sound field as I expected, but it is still good enough for a five star.    USB input:  Pros: It can play pictures, musics and even avi,DivX files on usb drive. The music files can be played promptly. And you can play musics and pictures at the same time.  Cons: It is kind of slow when loading the pictures.     FM radio:  The hole in the FM antenna is a square while the pin on the receiver is round. I finally connected them together the third time I tried. The Radio did not work until I connected the antenna.       In all, it is a pretty good system for the money."
2086,4,"This mount comes with every single possible set of bolts and spacers that you could possibly need to mount your TV.  This mount is very sturdy and more than enough to hold my 52\\"" LCD screen.  As a structural engineer my opinion is that this is a very well designed product.  The only thing I might do a little differently change the design of two small screws that lock in the tilt of the screen when you have settled on the proper angle. It would be nice if they would just loosen and not be totally removable because they are a little hard to get back in if completely removed.  Really, to avoid this little issue all that needs to be done is simply loosen just enough to let it tilt.      I was tempted to buy the \\""Heavy Duty\\"" mount which comes out to the same price after it's rebate, but why go through the rebate thing when this mount costs the same without waiting for a rebate?  I recommend this item and would buy it again."
2087,5,Plenty of protection for my home theater. Great aluminum construction and long reaching cord. Unbeatable price.
2088,4,This was a gift to my granddaughter and I really can't say how it is working just that she likes it a lot.    Pamela Hedstrom
2089,4,I bought this item for a peice of mind. I really cant tell what it does other than being a high priced surge protecter. But it was better me buying it here than for twice the price at BB.    Thanks  Brandon
2090,4,Our reliable Laserjet 4L was running out of toner and I hadn't realized how much HP toner cost.  I figured I'd try something cheaper like MIPO and see if it worked.  So far I've printed out ~300 pages and there hasn't been any trouble.
2091,3,"JBL...  I have like JBL products for about 20 years now.. so when i got these speakers from amazon, at a great price, I expected JBL. Well you can read the other reviews as far as the sound goes. I have mine in a 3 car garage not the best place to evaluate a pair of speakers. On the back of the speakers you will see a tag MADE IN CHINA.  I just thought you all deserved to know before you buy. If you say you dont care, I understand. But dont let you kid chew on the speaker cabinet, it probably has lead in it."
2092,2,"I think that any time you use a converter, you usually lose some quality.  I was not expecting to lose this much though.  I only used this for a couple of days and gave up because the quality of the image was so bad.  I think it's just the nature of the product.  A composite cable does not carry the same quality signal as s-video and trying to down-convert the signal is futile."
2093,1,"I saw this recommended for use with the Panasonic Technics SLBD20D Semi Automatic Turntable, but it cannot be used with that turntable due to a pronounced hum, even with the ground wire attached. This may be a good cartridge with a different turntable, one with a shielded or distant motor, but not with the SLBD20D. In fact, a brief Google search after I tried to use this cartridge with this turntable produced many references to \\""the infamous Grado hum\\"" - so perhaps it has this problem with other turntables as well. This problem should surely be mentioned."
2094,5,"Everyone is impressed with my camera and the skin cover.  The cover fits perfectly, at the same time protecting the camera and making it easier to handle."
2095,5,"Elegant look, easy set-up, outstanding performance.  Hooked up a Bose speaker system, ran the automatic speaker set-up and it sounds great.  Hooked up a DS-A2X iPod Dock, inserted my iPod and the sound is unbelieveable.  Played a DVD and both the picture and sound was outstanding.  Combining the new reduced price along with free shipping, you can't ask for a better buy for the money or quality.  2 thumbs-up!"
2096,4,"This is a great remote. It actually does simplfy your home theater. Once set up, it is easy to control everything.<br /><br />The software that comes with the remote is pretty good, although it didn't run on my mac the way the documentation suggested it would. It did easily install. Just use your instincts.<br /><br />Once installed, it is pretty simple to get it talking properly with your tv and player and such. I have it set up with an LCD tv, a dvd player, and my gamecube.<br /><br />I have had some problems getting it to \\""learn\\"" functions from my old remote but to be honest I haven't spent enough time on it. I tried for about half an hour to get the harmony model to learn the \\""go back to the previous channel I was viewing\\"" function from my old remote. Unsuccessful but I need to try again and then call customer support.<br /><br />Batter usage so far is great, I've had the remote working for probably about 3 weeks now and so far no battery problems.<br /><br />Of course it is a bit overpriced for a remote control but it does work well with a little effort from the user."
2097,5,Midland Product is good as expected.  Just what i need for instant weather alerts plus radio and other features. <br />We really like it.
2098,5,This product was just what I needed to connect my new home theater to my Hi Def TV.  Just the right lenght and picture quality and sound is excellent with this cable.
2099,5,"I can say that I received my product on time and the people that I had contact with was very nice and also my product was packaged very well and I am pleased with my Turn Table, I would reccomment anyone to try this product, are any other product. <br />"
2100,5,"I used (and broke) several headphone sets before purchasing this one. I kept  attempting to go lightweight and behind the head, but I'm just too active in my chair, spinning back and forth between computers, and the poor lightweight sets didn't hold up (I had problems with connectors and cords, and lost function). This set is not heavy, it's comfortable, the sound is excellent, and it's sturdy and has kept up with me very nicely. Love the on-cord mute and volume control."
2101,5,"Chossing a MP3 player shouldn't have been as difficult as it was. Ipod, Zune, Sansa etc etc. My experience with MP3 players was a Creative flash drive player 512MB that simply played music. What is didn't do was afford me storage for CD's and other media types.  Ipod was a very expensive alternative and it wasn't until I stumbled onto the Sandisk Sansa that I was tempted. I purchased the Sansa with a 2GB micro SD chip last week. After charging the unit overnight, I proceeded to load up my favorite CD's ad naseum. I've put over 20 so far and still have 7GB available. The controls require a little patience but I'm getting better with them each time I use it. There are plenty of accessories available and the docking station may be the best Idea for charging and permanent access to your computer. I purchased a better paid of earbuds from Creative labs and the Unit sounds incredible. I am real jazzed about this unit. I primarily use it when I work out 4-6 times a week at the gym. Get a protective shield to protect the unit from scratches and whatever.<br /><br />Remember though one man's floor is another man's ceiling. Listen to each unit at a electronics store before you buy online. Do some homework before you plunk down 200 or more to be disappointed."
2102,4,"If you are looking for a cost effective replacement for your original white earbuds, this is it.  The different size rubber earpieces offer an excellent choice of giving you comfort over a long period.  I have slept with these earbuds and have not noticed them.  The sound is very pleasant and for the average person will be very acceptable.  Let us face it, most of us cannot hear the entire extreme high and low frequencies any way, so why pay more for something that cannot be used.  These earbuds are the way to go for comfortable, cost effective, pleasurable listening to your device.  Whether it be an MP3 player, radio of CD player, these earbuds will make your music a most enjoyable experience."
2103,1,This MP3/MP4 doesn't work in less than 1 month! <br /> <br />This software has not passed Windows Logo testing to verify its compatibility with Windows.  Installing this software may impair or destabilize the correct operation of your system either immediately or in the future.  Microsoft strongly recommends that you do not use this device with your windows software. <br />
2104,4,Being in computer hardware engineering:  anyone who suggests to you that a digital signal is a digital signal is a digital signal clearly has _no_ clue what on earth they are talking about.   Im not suggesting that monster cables are the best thing since sliced bread - afterall you will be paying for their marketing budget with your purchase.   Subpar cords WILL indeed have reduction in DIGITAL signal bandwidth through various transmission line effects; this is why a fair number of people arent getting 1080p performance through the 5 dollar cords.   It is the bandwidth (the amount of information sent per given period of time) which determines how well these cords perform.
2105,1,"Unfortunately,my Creative Zen V2 did not worked with my system. I even bought a new pc to see if the Creative would work at all, but it didn't happened! PLEASE DON'T BOTHER TO BUY THIS PRODUCT, BUY A SANSA E200 IT MUCH SIMPLER AND EASY TO USE! I end up returning the product back to Amazon because it was obviously very defective!!! <br /> <br />I hope my review was helpful to you. <br />-Milly"
2106,1,"This is no better than the old fashion rabbit ears. The \\""powered\\"" portion of this antenna does NOTHING to boost the signal. I found this item to be almost useless since it does not pick up any analog signals very well at all. As for the digital signals, you will have to adjust the antenna whenever you change the channel. <br /> <br />If you spent your hard earned money on a HDTV, why are you going to buy a junkie antenna?"
2107,5,I love my iPod and rarely leave home without it.  I purchased the av dock and tv connection as well.  Great picture and sound.
2108,5,"I was in the market for a universal remote control to replace 6 of my controllers (TV, AV Receiver, DVD Player, Satellite Receiver, MP3 player and XM Radio).  Most of the universal remote controls I found were only capable of controlling popular brands which wouldn't serve my needs.  So I expanded my search to a learning, macro type controller and found several brands including Sony and Phillips.  I already own many Logitech computer peripherals and accessories and have been very impressed with them so needless to say, Logitech already had the advantage.  After much research, I decided to order one from Amazon which I got in 2 days!  The actual item packaging was the typical Logitech metallic green and silver box with a clear molded plastic showcasing the product. Once I got it out of the box, I immediately noticed the high quality material it employs and the weight and ergonomics were just right for a medium sized hand.      The basic set up and macro programming was easy as advertised but it gets a bit tedious when you start customizing the buttons to your liking.  The web based programming works well and the \\""plug and sync\\"" feature is very smart and convenient.  Basically, you make all the changes on your PC either by using the remote's software or going to the Logitech website to upload your changes.  Once you're finished making all the changes, plug in your remote via USB and click \\""Update Remote\\"" on the user interface on your PC and your done!  I love the fact that Logitech has given the consumers complete freedom to customize the remote control.  Almost all of the buttons plus pages and pages of the LCD buttons are programmable which makes it the only \\""true\\"" universal remote control out there.    Be patient as you explore all the features of the remote.  It'll take a couple of weeks of programming and a lot testing to get the remote to behave exactly how you want it.  But once you're done, you'll be rewarded with extreme convenience, not to mention all the praises from your better half.    The only non programmable buttons are:   Main Power, Activities, Help, Page Left, Glow, Page Right, Devices and Media.    Also, the rechargeable battery is a huge bonus!  I charge mine at an average of once per week which can easily be stretched to 10 days if needed. I try to avoid constant charging as much as possible to extend the battery life.    The Verdict: The Logitech Harmony 880 is highly recommended to electronic enthusiasts looking for ways to enhance their media entertainment experience.  You're probably thinking: \\""I'm not going to spend $150 for a freakin' remote control\\"" I know I did, but the more I use it the more I'm glad I got one.  This one is worth every penny folks!"
2109,2,"Alright, first off this piece of crap will randomly stop playing. It started off when I'd just walk around that it would turn off, but now sometimes I barely TOUCH IT and tilt it to the side to look at the song and it turns off.  It is NOT easy to use if you're a HOLD button person... if you have it on hold while plugged into your computer, it will not let you delete or add music, which made me panick at first and fear for a permanant playlist. <br />Also, the headphones that come with it are REALLY not worth it, they are really really bad, so go buy some nice Sony ones. <br />AND, the song switcher thinger is a little defective... it's neat, but you can push it down and it'll hit something inside of the MP3 player that makes the songs skip and be all crazy... so it gives me a fear of damaging the insides of my MP3 player whenever its in my pocket or something. <br />I think thats about it... I wouldn't recommend it, unless you want a cheap piece of s***."
2110,5,"This product works great. I've done a lot of research on what humidifier to buy and I am very pleased with this model. It's very quiet,easy to clean and pumps a lot of moisture into the air. More exspensive, but you get what you pay for in most cases. I think the claim of 600 sq feet is a stretch, but still a very good unit for most situations"
2111,3,"I have found my Cowan A2 to be an excellent portable video device, but I'm disappointed with some significant deficiencies it has when it comes to playing music.  First, the A2 does not recognize playlists in the .M3U or .PLS format (or any other)-- the playlist functionality is limited to creating an \\""on the go\\"" playlist on the device, which cannot be saved after a power off.  Second, the A2 \\""reads\\"" ID3 tags, but does not allow the user to browse music on the device based on the tags-- e.g., you cannot search or play songs based on \\""artist\\""  or \\""genre\\"" etc.  Music on the device is organized strictly on a folder-tree system.   <br /> <br />I recommend the Cowan A2 if you are primarily looking for a video device.  However, if music-playback functionality is an equally important factor for you in choosing a media player, the Cowan A2's lack of these key features probably makes it the wrong choice."
2112,4,"Awesome, completely scratch proof (they dissapear), slightly bulky, don't like the wmv only video capability"
2113,4,"I listen to mostly books and podcasts, so these little do dads work just great for me. The cheap iPod ear buds are very uncomfortable and tend to fall out of your ears, so these little converters do help in keeping the earbuds in place if you're exercising. The sound quality is adequate for my needs; I have some sony ear buds that work better for music and also fit better, but these at least make the apple ear buds usable as a backup pair. The sony ear buds do cancel out noise (like in a fitness center) better, but there may be times when you don't want to be deaf to the world. The cute little case and the extra sized buds are a nice addition."
2114,2,"For anyone considering this product it is a great idea, but if you are the owner of an iPod shuffle that is a year or more old, it doesn't work with the iLuv system.  I am a little disappointed that there was no mention of this issue until I looked in the troubleshooting section of the manual.  Obviously, after I bought it."
2115,5,"I can't say anything bad about it! Excellent sound, very long cord, nice volume control. Mostly is using this thing for skype - will never switch to another headset."
2116,4,"The sound quality of the headphones is pretty good. Bought these with the intention to use of flights to watch movies on a dvd player...while they do eliminate some of the noise on the plane they do not block all.  For the money, these headphones are a pretty decent deal...I would recommend getting a volume booster to go along with these headphones (or any headphones for that matter) if planning to use on flights.  One huge benefit to these headphones is unlike the plug-in ear type, after a couple hours of use my ears did not hurt."
2117,5,"I got these speakers because I've never had any good speakers in my room.  So for $50 these things are awesome!  I was amazed at the quality of sound you get with these.  They sound fine by themselves, but paired up with the sony subwoofer (sa wm250 vary awesome too!) they sound great."
2118,5,"I bought this player on impulse last week at Circuit City because it was on sale and was going to return it but I'm glad I changed my mind.  It feels nice in my hand and the sound is great.  I didn't like the earbuds that came with the player but I bought a pair of $20 Phillips earphones that are much more comfortable.  <br /> <br />This Sansa is loaded with features, it has an FM radio tuner and it comes in really clear.  You can also record voice messages to yourself or record from the radio.  It's so easy to transfer music to the player I just drag and drop the songs from my computer to the Sansa.  I like having the freedom of using whatever music downloading system I want or none at all. <br /> <br />I'm very happy with this purchase, much cheaper and more features than the iPod Nano.  I highly recommend the Sansa."
2119,5,"I bought this product because I thought I could cut the clutter under my desk. Instead of using 2-seven socket surge protectors(neither with all plugs fully occupied), I now use this 11 outlet. It is good because now everything is in one central location. It also comes with cables needed for your phone,a DSL slot and a cable slot if you need those.Unfortunately it really does nothing to cut your cord clutter. Featured in Dell's catalog this is a very good addition to any computer area. It's black accent matches darker computers(virtually all PC's). If you have an Apple Computer, I'd recommend something in white instead."
2120,2,Several factors make this Radio a little disappointing.  The various settings such as timer clock frequency etc.are very difficult and time consuming to program. I am still unable to get the timer on timer off working 100%. A call to C Crane was no help. The reception is not as good as my 40 year old GE. I have tried the suggestion on the outside antenna which caused a better signal however with noise and interferance with other stations. All in all to me it is very over rated.
2121,1,"Recently we have tried 3 different RCA products and had problems with all 3. When you call RCA Customer service, you will end up talking to someone in India or the Philippines who barely speaks English and doesn't really care about your problems.  <br />We bought one of these RCA MP3 players and contrary to what it says, they will not reliably play WMA and MP3 songs mixed together. We had been unable to get an answer from RCA as to why and whether there is a fix. We were lucky enough to be able to return the unit for a refund."
2122,2,"Very Low power in these NiCd's.....only 350mAh.  Unless you need to use NiCd's, I recommend you get some NiMh's, they have power ratings over 1000mAh's."
2123,5,"The purchase was easy, delivery as as expected.  Very satisfied with the merchandise and the service."
2124,1,Most of the 8.5GB 8X double layer discs failed during burning process. I had to purchase a pack at Sams to complete the task at hand. I do not know if RIDATA/RITEK discs are compatible. Thank you for asking. This is the first product purchased at AMAZON that was unsatisfactory. Sorry for this bad review.      miguel quezada  customer PS    (The shipping and timeliness of arriving in a speedy manner is to be commended. to bad about the prodict itself.)
2125,4,"I had owned a pair of these previously, but broke the cord. Took me a while to find them again, and only did so online. I use these to work out in the gym. They provide excellent external noise reduction and decent bass response. They get a bit overdriven when you really turn up the volume, but really, that doesn't happen too often.  <br /> <br />My wife can't use them, claiming her ear canals are too small, so ladies take note that these might not be your best option.  <br />"
2126,3,"I tend to have the smallest and most 'workout compatible' players available.  This is the GREATEST WORKOUT player I have ever owned.  It is perfect for working out, clips on anything, light and has all the features needed... but it claims to be playsforsure enabled, but after sending this unit back to be fixed 3 times it has come back to me 3 times and has not worked!  FRUSTRATION is an understatement.  Not only have I gone without a player when I workout, I have had to sit on the phone and pay shipping back to Samsung. <br /> <br />Again, GREAT player for MP3s only... BAD player if you are interested in playsforsure.  If you have not heard or do not use playsforsure... this is the best EVER... basically netflix for music, but unlimited rentals!!!"
2127,1,"Uploading songs to the iPod is a pain, you cannot place DVD movies onto the iPod with ripping assistance that takes hours... It is just a waste."
2128,2,"The reason i found that the speakers sound really heavy and boomy in the low end is directly due to the fact that they're 12\\"" speakers especially if the amplifier that's running them isn't of good quality. I have set up quite a few systems for people and have had nothing but bad reviews for 12\\"" woofers (subwoofers excluded) versus Excellent reviews for 10\\"" woofers. They seem to throw a punch like none other."
2129,5,"I bought this so that I could hook up my DVD Player to my television that has no place to hook it up. Not only was I able to hook up the DVD Player and VCR through this to the television, but it actually improved the picture on the screen. The picture is much clearer and the colors are more vibrant! I wholeheartedly recommend this item!"
2130,5,"I had some Polk Rti4 bookshelf speakers in need of amplification and a CD player.  Based on a review I read here, I bought one of these at Circuit City for $85.  The Sony main unit plays the Polk speakers just fine.  In fact, it sounds just as good as when I had a separate JVC receiver and a TEAC Cd player hooked up to the Polks.  I also really like Sony's DSGX feature, which gives the music more dynamics and brings out more detail. There is an input on the back, so I am using it for computer sound too. <br /> <br />I cannot comment on the speakers that came with it because I never took them out of the box. I bought the Polks for $200 a few years ago, so for $285 I have a very good bedroom system."
2131,5,"Despite the fact that no AC power cord comes attached, I was stunned by the sound output of these tiny speakers.  They're superb.  My only quibble would be that I'd prefer them in black, but that matters very little once you hear these titans.  I've bought other mini-speakers within this price range and basically junked them... but Phillips comes through again and exceeds expectations.  Don't judge them by their size."
2132,5,"I have been enjoying the Gigabeat during my air travel. Viewing movies and listening to music drowns out the screaming kid in 10A. Just think, Toshiba is saving rug-rat lives wherever business travelers go."
2133,4,"Pros: <br />-cheap <br />-carrying case <br />-lightweight, not bulky <br />-pretty good bass for small in-ears <br />-different size ear tips included <br /> <br />Cons: <br />-cord just a little too short; I can't even set my iPod in my lap without using the included extension <br />-I have to use the largest tips to get a good enough seal, and then I really have to shove them in there <br />-the average user may not be able to achieve a good seal. you have to lift up the outer ear with your hand, put in the plug and give it a slight twist to seat it in there, and then let go of your outer ear to lock it in there <br />-if you need to take them in and out frequently, these would be a pain to use <br />"
2134,4,"I have had my Rio Forge Sport, 512 MB player for over a year now.  I take it to the gym everyday.  Even after throwing it around the car, gym bags, and generally just being rough with it, it still works great.  I had one problem with it, but fixed it and it works like new. <br />I would definitely buy another one."
2135,4,"1st off, don't bother with their software, it's outdated, go to their site and then downloads to get latest software. DON'T use Firefox, they claim it's not supported. For the life of me, I couldn't make it work on my main computer, I never figured out why, I suspect because I have 1.1 USB and not USB2 so I went to my backup computer, spend much more time and deep into the install I get a message won't work on Windows98 so on to the laptop. This time, everything went very smoothly,no install glitches at all but I'm 6 hours into this frustrating install. Now on to configuring the remote, what a breeze. I did half RF and half infrared. Everything runs perfectly with minor tweeking and I have a fairly complicated setup. After all the aggrivation, the bottom line is once installed, this is a great remote. It really deserves 5 stars, but it has to loose because of so many difficulties. This remote will make anyone in my family easily run all the equipment, up until now, noone but me could run everything. I must note that the support is very good, I started at 8:30, after a fairly long hold, I got support.  They were very patient but didn't solve the problem, they passed it to problems with my Verizon router which turned out not to be the case, but they didn't rush me and if it didn't get so late, they probably would have fixed my problems but they had to go to close, they are there until 10PM.  I was anxious so I was up until the wee hours to get it going.  As I said, I never figured out why my main computer wouldn't work, if I do I will update but if I would have started with the laptop, it would have been smooth. Both my main machine and laptop are running XP pro."
2136,5,"Normal bias audio cassettes are easy enough to find. It seems the high quality audio tapes are mostly found right now in 'you name it, we got it' places. (Such as F.Y.E.) People have gotten into the habit of bringing cds everywhere, despite the recently found danger of cd rot. But it does seem that the 'unseen hand' is keeping audio cassettes alive. Most cd players have a cassette deck in them, and even dual cassette decks are not hard to find. In addition, car stereos with both the cd AND cassette are becoming more popular. I suspect that the reason high quality cassettes are harder to find right now is because music does not really have the fidelity it used to. (It would make sense seeing that normal bias audio tapes are still quite easy to find. Even Shoprite and other supermarkets have them. And if the cd is not so intese, it will actually transfer well onto a normal bias audio tape.) Well, if you follow my reviews, you know that I think it is much safer for one to make copies of cds. (Heat and moisture rot the cd and render it unusable.) As far as these tapes go, even if you are using them to record intense cds such as King Diamond's, these tapes are superb. Think about it. Doesn't it make more sense to make an extra copy of the cd and use it, rather than risk losing the original copy to cd rot?"
2137,2,"Apple quality is terrible, and they don't stand behind their products. My iPod Photo started malfunctioning almost immediately after the warranty expired. I have spent more time resetting it and reloading it than listening to it. The battery gives no where near the advertised power. If you don't pay for an Apple Care policy for an extra year, Apple will not provide any service or refer to third party service for an iPod, even if you wish to pay for it. <br /> <br />According to the Apple Store technician, the iPod's hard drive is defective, probably was from the staryt, resulting in intermittent crashes (sad iPod face in display), inability to power on or freezing of device. Another Apple technician told me he believed the logic board is bad. They suggested replacement of the device, which cost $499, at my cost as the one-year manufacturer's warranty expired nine months ago."
2138,5,"I searched for quite a while for a wall mount for my 42\\"" flat screen.  I looked at Omnimount's single and double cantilever mounts in addition to this Sanus, but eventually decided on the Sanus due to lower cost and issues about Omnimount's instruction clarity that were raised in other reviews written here.      I had some hesitation about trusting myself with this install, but Sanus' instructions really make the process quite simple.  The hardest part of the install was just finding the studs in the wall.  The instructions were clear, well written and included a page where all screws/bolts were represented in real-life size, which made identifying them extremely easy.  Check out the Sanus website - it contains pdf links for their assembly instructions and you'll see what I mean.  The install can be done by one person except for the step in which you have to lift the TV onto the wall to attach the arm to the wall plate.    The mount itself seems well made, and is quite heavy.  Everything fits as it should, there was no forcing parts or screws/bolts to go together... the manufacturing tolerances must be pretty tight.  Also, Sanus included eight sets of different sized mounting screws - increases the possibility of finding a match for your tv.  I'd highly recommend this mount for anyone looking for a relatively easy install of a full-motion wall mount.      Notes:    (1) The TV moves away from the wall and swings side to side just by grabbing it and moving it around.  However, if you want to tilt the screen, there are two hand turned knobs behind the tv that first have to be loosened, tv tilted to your preference, then knobs retightened.  It can be done by one person but easier if you have another set of hands.  Something to consider if you plan on tilting and untilting the TV often.    (2) The mount has two metal bars that run horizontally across the back of the TV.  One of the bars may cross directly over where your connections go (for me, it blocked the HDMI and component video connectors) so pay attention to that - you will have to connect the wires before installing the bar to the monitor brackets.  If you wait until after the bar is mounted, there's no way you can connect the cables."
2139,3,"I think these are the earphones that come standard with the ZEN MicroPhoto. I think they sound pretty good for earphones; however, the foam on one of them fell off and I have to go look for it... I agree with Smith ^^ in that the foam thingies come off frequently... <br /> <br />Other than that, its a good set of headphones."
2140,1,"This is the worst piece of software that I have ever owned (including shareware/freeware).  This is the 2nd product I have purchased by Griffin Technology (the other was the microphone for iPods).

2142,4,Great gadget. Decent price. Lots of options. <br />What else do you need?
2143,4,Great product. Easy to load and use. Very small size a real plus. Ability to select exactly what song(s) or alblum(s) is crucial to this MP3 player's enjoyability. Recommend to anyone who wants the capacity that 1GB provides.
2144,4,"Great sound from a light-weight, comfortable headphone with a wide frequency range. These are more comfortable than earbuds and also result in less fatigue than wearing heavier headphones with wider frequency response. Especially effective reproduction at low volumes. I am glad I purchased."
2145,5,"Got my order in just before they sold out....gotta say, I was surprised at the great quality (durablity) and sound coming from the flat panel speakers. For the price I paid (a third of MSRP), it is an unbeatable gadget. Haven't had any problems with the speaker connections either. All in all, a great buy!"
2146,2,"nah, these earphones dont fit in your ears too well. they have three sizes but they dont quite stay in your ear. also, if your the athletic type. there is no way in hell you should consider these. try sony's 'hook around the ear' type. way better."
2147,4,"I am very impressed by the sound quality of this device when used with skype. The build quality is also high. <br />Unfortunately it is not large enough and does not fit my head well. If you are concerned that you have low set ears, or a particularly large brain then you should try this device before you buy."
2148,5,The best money can buy for a small room.  For a big room I'd go with a bigger subwoffer.
2149,4,"This is a good radio. Period.  It is simple with only three knobs. The reception is excellent. The sound is good and loud enough for for a large room. There are two minor shortcomings: 1. To turn off the radio from FM, I need to pass AM selection first. It is minor annoyance. 2. Another problem I find is that after turn it on and adjust for the FM reception, the FM tuner will loose the station after the radio is warmed up. I need to go back to adjust the tuner again. Personally I think these problems are minor. I recommend this radio highly."
2150,3,"Amazon lists this product as compatible with iPod Nano.  Technically it does work with Nano, and the sound is quite good.  But beware - Logic3 does not provide a cradle adapter for iPod Nano.  You have to plug your Nano directly into the docking port with no cradle to hold it firmly in place.  This means you'll have to be extremely careful not to press too hard on your iPod's buttons while it's docked, or you could damage the I-Station."
2151,3,"The radio reception is OK, not great. The Sound is great for the size and price. The CD mechanism quit after three days and would not eject a CD. That's when I found out that Cambridge won't honor warranty for items bought from Amazon. They had me send it in for repair with a fifty dollar payment. It hasn't been returned yet."
2152,5,"I had this player before I got a Nano as a gift, and it worked very well for me.  I didn't have any mechanical problems with it (as I had with the first couple players I had).  It holds a decent amount of music and runs for a good amount of time on one battery.  I would use it commuting and working out."
2153,1,"I bought this for my daughter at Christmas and she just came to me asking why it sounds so bad.  The automatic bass causes the bass output to be distorted & sound terrible.  I tried my professional quality headphones & the same distortion.  Tried new batteries, different CD's all with the same lousy sound quality.  If you could turn off the DBBS, maybe it would sound better, but is always on.  Don't buy this player."
2154,5,"i bought this for myself. I have an archos 6 gig mp3 player that needs to be fixed it stopped charging after awhile, well  i decided on a whim i wanted another mp3 player. so i looked at a few online at walmart's site. I was all set to get the 4 gig archos one, but i decided that i wanted a radio in it also. I loved the look of the philips one.<br /><br />well i ended up going the next day to get it. (that was this past thursday)<br /><br />It is now sunday and i love this thing. I have decided that in a few months when i can save up i am going to save up for the  30 gig version. I listen to alot of music, and have alot of it on my computer.<br /><br />If you do have this mp3 player don't use the earbuds that come with it they sound like crap. I bought a pair of sony ones awhile back that i just adore that i use with this player.<br /><br />I haven't really had any problems with this player so far. i like the touch scrolling and the touch controls but as previously stated they do take some getting used to. I just use a light touch to get where i want to go.  i do really love having the option to listen to the radio, after years of using my other mp3 player i was just so out of touch with the radio since whenever i went anywhere i'd use my mp3 player. Now i can at least have the option to turn the radio on and have my presets at my finger tips. and i do love the little recording feature i havent really used that yet but i am sure if i have something important enough to remember i will.<br /><br />I also really love equalizer and the different presets i have kept it on the srs wow setting but i think i will have to customize it :), i like that you get a custom option.<br /><br />most of my music isn't in wma format so i have just over 1500 songs on it at the moment, and since i have over 3000 songs on my computer i have to rotate my music quite a bit but i have to say that syncing with the windows media player doesn't take all that long.<br /><br />I am so glad that this player is so much smaller and lighter than my archos that thing was just a pain to lug around but since it's been a few years it makes sense that they've gotten so much smaller lighter and more portable.<br /><br />I would recommend this player to anyone with a moderate music collection, who doesn't have as many songs as i do (but then when i can i am upgrading to the 30 gig gogear lol).<br /><br />great player for the price, if u are looking for multitasking in your devices this is a good one don't go for an overpriced over-rated ipod, the gogear can also store data files for transfering to other computers another thing i was looking for in my mp3 player.lighter than my archos that thing was just a pain to lug around but since it's been a few years it makes sense that they've gotten so much smaller lighter and more portable. <br /> <br />I would recommend this player to anyone with a moderate music collection, who doesn't have as many songs as i do (but then when i can i am upgrading to the 30 gig gogear lol). <br /> <br />great player for the price, if u are looking for multitasking in your devices this is a good one don't go for an overpriced over-rated ipod, the gogear can also store data files for transfering to other computers another thing i was looking for in my mp3 player."
2155,5,"I've always used full sized 'cans' when listening to music and I never thought that earbuds would ever come close to replicating the sound of full size cans.  A friend of mine bought these a couple of months ago and went on and on about how good they sound.  <br /> <br />Eventually, I began looking into these - I researched the E4Cs, E3Cs, and Ultimate Ears.  In the end, I settled on these because I couldn't justify spending 300 dollars on a pair when I would be listening to MP3s.    <br /> <br />They arrived today via UPS and I put them in - with the plastics cones - and I was shocked - they sounded good, but not that good.  I couldn't understand why people were saying these sounded so good. <br /> <br />I got home from work tonight and did some more reading - one thing I read over and over again were the constant reminders to make sure you had a good fit and I thought I did.  I then went to Shure's website and watched the instructions on how to insert them properly.   I also switched from the plastic cones to the foam.  Once I did this and followed Shure's instructions, I was completely blown away by the quality - Just amazing.  I am hearing things I've never heard before in my music.  I cannot stress this enough - make sure you get the proper fit - I had the best luck with yellow foam.  Just make sure you take the time and you won't be sorry. <br /> <br />"
2156,4,"When I first purchased Altec Lansing inMotion speakers for my iPod near a couple years ago, I immediately fell in love with them. They were the kind of things you took in public and people would say \\""That's coming from those little speakers!?!\\"" While treasuring them on every road trip and day outdoors, I had one question in my mind: \\""When is a product going to top this one?\\"" Although all kinds of iPod speakers followed in their footsteps, this is the first time one in the same league has topped the inMotion speakers.  <br /> <br />Yes.. In my opinion, these are the best travel speakers you could possibly buy for the iPod. Below I will review why these are the best choice over Altec Lansing's inMotion speakers, JBL's OnStage speakers, and larger systems such as the Bose SoundDock. I will also review the pros and cons of the mm50s as a stand-alone product.  <br /> <br />Why buy these over JBL OnStage speakers? - These not only sound better, but can be played without plugging into an electric outlet. The OnStage set is popular because they look cool and sound good. When such a compact system has no option to run off batteries, the size seems to be in vain.  <br /> <br />Why buy these over the Bose SoundDock? - The sound quality is near the same league of that produced by the SoundDock while selling for a fraction of the cost. The Bose SoundDock is essentially not even a travel system because you need to plug it in an outlet whenever you use it. Beyond that it is really too large to comfortably fit in any kind of suit case while leaving room for anything beyond a single pair of socks. The Logitech MM50s are convenient for packing with your luggage and could be played for 7 or more hours at a time without needing a plug.  <br /> <br />Why buy these over larger boom-box style systems?  - With sound quality touching near the same goal post as those that require their own duffle bag, there is no question about it if you plan on using your speakers for travel... And isn't that the point of getting a one-piece unit over a regular stereo or 2.1 system? The MM50s are small enough to stuff in a suitcase without sacrificing much space yet unpack with the power to rock out a good-sized room.  <br /> <br />Most important ...Why these over the Altec Lansing inMotion speakers? - Altec Lansing's inMotion speakers really remained the king of the travel-sized iPod speakers since they were released. It doesn't matter if they had the travel remote or how they folded up. They continue to be compact, sound great for the size, and charge up the iPod when you plug them in the wall. Since the release of the mm50s, they are no longer the best in their league, however. This comes at a single cost.  <br /> <br />Unlike the 8 inch wide inMotion speakers, the mm50s stretch near 13 inches in width. The actual body is slightly thicker as well, but remains shorter in height. Add it all up and the mm50 is slightly larger in overall mass. After selling my inMotions before receiving my mm50s, I wondered if I made the correct decision in upgrading due to the size difference. Now I can comfortably say the larger body is definitely worth it. In most cases, the mm50s can pack in your luggage just as easily as the inMotions.  <br /> <br />The physical size difference is more than paid for in sound quality, which is considerably better in terms of bass and presence. The surround feature also adds a touch of depth to certain songs that cannot be matched by the inMotion speakers by any means. Beyond that, they could actually pump out bass, something the inMotion speakers could never do regardless of the sound depth they produced. This is not thumping bass, yet a significant improvement resulting from the larger drivers. They are no louder in volume than the inMotions, however.  <br /> <br />The mm50s top inMotion, yet they are still far from being a perfect travel system. From a physical standpoint, the speakers are solid and perfectly match the design of the iPod. They actually feel more like a brick than the inMotion speakers, which are a bit on the flimsy side in comparison. The buttons on the speakers and the remote are solid as well, which really make the system friendly to the wear and tear of travel. The grill in front of the drivers is also more than enough to protect them. <br /> <br />The sound quality, while exceeding that of the inMotion speakers can still distort at high levels, but this greatly depends on the kind of music being played. I was surprisingly able to play Daft Punk with the bass pumping yet hardly any distortion. <br /> <br />The remote does a fine job at flipping between songs, pausing, and adjusting the volume. It even lets you skip forward and backward through slide shows. Being that this functionality was included, it is surprising that there is no AV out cable hook-ups on the back of the unit for TV use. This could have easily saved the need to buy a $20 AV cable for the video iPod, but is by no means a deal breaker.  <br /> <br />The three most significant kinks in the operation of the mm50s lie in the remote, volume controls, and internal battery. The remote is the least forgiving of these, because it seems like something that could have easily been avoided. As stated in other reviews, the remote only works when it is pointed in a relatively straight direction toward the sensor on the speakers. Pointing the controller any higher or lower will simply not work. This appears to be due to the fact that the sensor is sunken so deep into the speaker unit itself, a mistake which shows a major lack of consideration in design. Another kink lies in the fact that the volume controls on the speakers effect the setting on the iPod itself, but changing the volume on the iPod does not effect the volume of the speakers. This can result in the iPod displaying low volume while the speakers themselves are cranked to the max. This is a small detail, but remains a confusing aspect I believe could have been avoided.  <br/> <br />The internal rechargeable battery, while sparing the expense of disposable ones, leaves no easy option for replacement. This greatly limits the possibility for extended cordless use beyond 7 or so hours. The option to swap rechargeable batteries would have added enough flexibility to comfortably use the speakers over camping trips, but was sadly left out from the design, causing the battery to be a trade-off instead of a gain (Inexcusable, Logitech).  <br /> <br />Other reviews have noted how the flip out legs do not work on uneven surfaces, but this is something that can be remedied with a little imagination and leg adjustments. The speakers also have the tendency to move while playing at high volumes. This is another thing that could be remedied with a bit of imagination. Neither of these I would consider to be design flaws simply because they are a direct result of the decision to make the speakers as compact as possible. <br /> <br />As I have listed all the flaws of these speakers, the mm50s are still the nearest you can get to a perfect travel speaker set for the iPod. The flaws of this product are more aggravating in the sense that they could have been avoided than in actual use. Any iPod is really incomplete without them."
2157,5,My wife bought these headphones for me last Christmas (2004).  I was thrilled and surprised.  At first I did not think I would use them that much but I use them all the time.  I use them at least 3 hours everyday.  They have held up extremely well.  The batteries are still holding a charge.  Sometime the reception is not what it could be.  You can certainly walk around the house freely but you will experience static in certain spots.  Duh....it's wireless so you will have some sometimes.  But 10 feet from the movie or ballgame is perfect always.
2158,5,"Oh my! This is a very sharp lens! High-quality, weighty, well-made! I use this with my Canon EOS 20D and 350D cameras. Great performance! I do not think that I have had a picture come out anything less than sharp using this lens! This is the only Sigma brand lens I own; all my others are Canon brand. I get the feeling that Sigma must be a worthy Canon competitor in regard to the quality of their lenses, but I can't base that on having owned only one Sigma lens. Anyway, I certainly recommend this 20mm as a GREAT wide-angle lens!"
2159,1,"I read the reviews about how bad these were but, because they were cheap I thought I would try them. I bought nine of which four actually worked and five are coasters... I strongly suggest buying another brand. My dvd drive was up to date with latest firmware, using dvd shrink with Nero burn engine. Success was hit or miss."
2160,5,Very Good Radio: I use it for Walk and get all the stations I want.
2161,2,"Our iPod failed twice within the first week of purchase. Apple said the first call for assistance to their tech support line was free. But the second time we called, they said that a fee would be charged. They ultimately agreed to help us for free. We sent the iPod back after the second failure and are now waiting for a replacement. We cannot recommend an iPod."
2162,5,I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. He loves the IPOD. Delivery was prompt. Didn't have any problems.
2163,5,Verbatim Makes quality DVD-R's.  They need to go on sale more often.
2164,4,Great product but comes without a cartridge! Make sure you order a cartdrige at the same time ...
2165,1,"I made the mistake of selling my old Net MD devices and buying several of these MZ-NH600D units to replace the old ones.  At first, it seemed like they were a great replacement to the old models.  Greater storage.  Can connect to PC and use as a drive.  It is now 3 months later and 2 of the ones I bought have broken.  One, broke a month and a half after I bought it, was serviced, returned and broke again.  Sony should be ashamed of putting their names on this junk.  They were obviously trying to squeeze out profit on these units at the expense of quality and customer satisfaction."
2166,5,"I had a 15GB iPod and also sold it to get this (green version). I have to say, even though it holds less songs, that this is alot better. I erased ALOT of songs i dont listen too, but i dont regret it because they were there for no reason.  <br /> <br />The new minis are darker than the older ones. The old mini green was lime green, this ones darker and looks alot better. The case is hard, and doesn't get scratched easy like the big ipod. The click wheel is great, and i like it alot better than the old one. When its in my pant pocket, I can just click the button inside of my pocket without taking it out,(I had the touch 15Gb iPod). The only problem is that the scroll whell isnt as sensative as the other iPod. <br /> <br />The sound seems to be improved alittle. I can turn the volume half way up and it will be as loud as my old iPod at three forths the volume. The battery is also great. I have the backlight on for 2 seconds, and use nice Sennheiser headphones, (Different headphones drain more battery), and listen to the volume at about three fourth, and the battery last about 12 hours. Not bad sinch the last ipod with light and better headphones lasted for about an hour and a half.. <br /> <br />The iPod doesn't have that many extras. It has games, nots, clock, calander, and contacts. Other Mp3 players have voice recorders, fm radio, ect. Thats o.k though because they don't have the innovation. <br /> <br />All in all, I suggest you buy this. You won't regret it."
2167,2,"The player itself was OK (when it was working); buttons are a bit small, sound quality is pretty good but software isn't all that great with glitches that require you to take the battery out to reset it from time to time.  Just recently, I started encountering problems (as did someone else I knew who purchased the same player) with the head phone jack and unfortunately, it was after 90 days.  They wanted me to pay a $40 labor fee to fix their rather inferior product!  Plus, the technical support isn't very good.  I'll never waste my money on a Creative product again."
2168,5,These DVD-R's work great 0 costers out of 50.. I dont what kind of dvd burners these people are using but if they have a good dvd burner they would not have any trouble burning with these dvd-r's. Oh yea Plextor drives rock!
2169,5,"I didn't order my PX100 from amazon. I order my PX100 Limited Edition Retro from warehouse123.com, and this limited edition fitted with retro looking yellow pads that imitate the old HD414 from the 1970s. Sennheiser has gotten into the \\""retro\\"" game with their most popular portable headphones. It looks reminiscent of the old HD414, with yellow instead of black foam.  <br /> <br />It sounds absolutely amazing, at least compared to the stock sound. Slightly dark but very rich and no distortion. You can't be impressed with the px100 sound, but for being portable, closed and durable, its a great headphone. <br /> <br />The bottom line: The PX100 is a good choice for travelers seeking a compact headphone design"
2170,5,I dont know how this even has one bad review the verbatim movie discs work every single time on every burner.....if your really into dvd burning there are many forums you can look to help you....one afterdawn.com.....i havent tried other discs yet except a tdk dvd+rw which burned fine but wouldnt play in my dvd player....just a note if your wanting to play your videos on a dvd player dvd-r is the disc you should go for.
2171,2,"I ordered my Zen Micro and was excited when it came by FedEx.  I opened up the box and was sure I would be listening to music soon.  Unfortunately, you get about 3 pages of instructions, none of which tell you how to transfer music, very annoying, my music would transfer into the PC library on the software, but I couldn't get it to transfer to the Micro, support center closed at 6pm, and you only get 1 free call, so I was SOL.  Also, the touch pad on this thing is waaaay to sensitive even at a low setting, it was ridiculous, I wanted to throw this thing out of the window.  I sent it back for a refund and ordered an iPod, which all of my friends said I should have done in the first place, the few dollars you save on this is NOT worth it!!"
2172,1,"DO NOT BUY THIS MP3 PLAYER.  Battery life is horrible and tech support was even worst when I called about the battery life. Creative claims that they have resolved the battery problem by introducing new firm ware.  I downloaded it and the same problem. Many people have had trouble with this product, buy something else."
2173,2,"I can't say this player has been ALL bad, so I will list the pro's and con's for you to let you make your own decision: <br />GOOD <br />1) Memory -- If you're using this to exercize or take a few songs on the road, this tiny device is very handy.  The 256MB memory holds about 8 hours of music, which I found was more than enough for my uses. <br />2) Shape -- compared to the RCA Lyra I first bought, this player proved to be more innovative in its shape.  I found it easy to carry on runs, and the joystick made it easy to switch songs and volume without interrupting my workouts to figure out what button did what.  The unit comes with an arm-strap, but I found it harder to change songs on my arm than with the unit in my hand.  It's light and small -- didn't bother me to carry it. <br /> <br />BAD <br />1) Battery life -- I found I didn't get more than 8-10 hours battery life on this player.  This was especially annoying when the battery died on a long run and I had to carry the thing dead all the way back (it gets a lot heavier when you're not getting anything out of it). <br />2) Compatability -- If you have a Macintosh, BEWARE!  Since buying this unit I have gotten a new computer and switched from PC to MAC; I have to use a friend's computer to do anything to it now.  <br />3) Radio Recording -- This feature is USELESS.  Even on the highest level , the sound quality is so terrible I can't imagine how anyone would get anything useful out of it.  My player has also been unable to DELETE these bad sound files, so I have to run through them every time I go through my playlist. <br />4) Changing Music -- Recently (I have had this player for about 7 months now) there has been a \\""LOCK\\"" on certain songs on my player, and I am unable to delete the music on there.  Thankfully this only includes about half of the memory, but I'm sure Black Eyed Peas \\""Hey Mama\\"" is going to get old pretty soon.   <br /> <br />If you're going to buy this player I HIGHLY recommend getting an extended warrenty from Best Buy or Circuit City.  As for myself, I've heard better things from iRiver and am switching brands ASAP!"
2174,4,"I've spent about 4 days with a 256mb Forge, and find the features better than any other player. I wanted an iRiver flash player, but have an investment in SD cards from my Palm T3. I like the quality and software that I've experienced with an iRiver and this is my first Rio of any kind. My final decision is why pay the same for an iRiver when this has the same memory, but I can add SD cards? <br /> <br />I wont go into the obvious details; the product description does that.  <br /> <br />The contoured shape is interesting and sometimes I'm not sure how to hold it. The D-pad controls seem to be better than the iRiver, not having ever held the iRiver, but its very PDA-like. Running on a AAA battery, the unit is incredibly small and delivers a claimed 20hrs. Its a trade off for the iRivers AA battery claim of 40. I haven't needed to change the battery yet, but it is definitely on track to reaching that claim. <br /> <br />I listen to recorded radio shows like Howard Stern and require the resume features in any player. The same requirement would be for Audible users I would imagine. The resume features are excellent. By default, it remembers the track and location at every shutdown. You can also create 10+ bookmarks for various locations.  <br /> <br />The build quality is only OK. It looks good in pictures; solid, made of metal. In reality, its not the most durable handheld device I own. In addition, the flashy chrome looks good, but is distracting trying to read the already curvy, reflective screen. I find myself changing the angle to see the screen trying to avoid reflections. I'm also concerned the chrome will peel off in a few months.  <br /> <br />The backlight is great; a nice even white while lighting up the controls in red. I like blue backlights, but this is a nice change for a modern look. The UI is great also, very much like my iPod, especially for such a small screen. Apple has forced manufacturers to make usablility much better. <br /> <br />I have had 3 issues so far: <br /> <br />1. Once it calaimed that my 512mb Lexar was full when it was far from it. I attribute it to the dual purpose use with a Palm PDA, so I formatted it for a clean filesystem. No problems since. <br /> <br />2. Occaisionally, it would reset itself, and lose my place in my track. I think is that the battery is not tight enough in the compartment, disconnecting power with a moderate bump. I stretched the spring a bit for a tighter fit. That should fix it.  <br /> <br />3. It would not recognize the device on a Windows XP SP2 machine, but was recognized on a SP1 machine, so that may be a SP2 issue. <br /> <br />Overall, I would recommend it if you like the features. That is exactly why I'm willing to work through the small issues. There is nothing else that matches it feature for feature for the money. <br />"
2175,1,"I bought the Archos 2.0.  New.  It did not work; wouldn't turn on.  Sent it in for repair (Archos has no 1-800 number, which means a long wait on your dime).  Returned the recorder, at my expense.  Weeks and weeks passed--much longer than the 10 days Archos represented as the average turn-around time.  When the recorder was returned, it was 10, not a 20.  Archos returned a cheaper model.  Called them up--same routine:  35-minute wait.  Answer was, \\""We do not have any more 20 models.  We can not send you a replacement.\\""   <br />If this type of service and product quality appeals to you, then by all means buy from Archos.  On the other hand, if you want a recorder that works and has 3X longer battery life, buy a Sony."
2176,5,"I'm using this amp between my audigy 2 sound card and my axiom m22ti bookshelf speakers. It's a very nice amp - looks cool and the sound is great, no hiss even with everything turned up, just delivers the power, no muss, no fuss. I'm no audiophile but for playing my mp3s and playing games and dvds, this thing performs admirably and my speakers seem quite happy with it too."
2177,5,"I'm really impressed with these headphones.  This is my first pair of Sennheiser headphones, and unlike other headphones I've had throughout the years, I use these for a variety of purposes: watching movies, working at my computer, or rocking out at the office.  They're great sounding, but best of all they're really comfortable.  These headphones never get uncomfortable on my head, so I can get the ultimate experience while watching The Wall, The Song Remains the Same, or the Godfather Trilogy.  Don't matter.  These things are a great set of headphones, especially for the price."
2178,5,"AudioSource is well known for providing good value for the price and they don't dissapoint with their 5-series amps. There's nothing in its price-range that has similar quality.<br />The output isn't quite as rich a Bruce Moore 70, but at 1/20th the price, it's a great deal."
2179,3,This remote is very cool and works on everything I have needed it to. It lives up to it's advertisement. But I have to replace the batteries once a month. VERY anoying!
2180,2,"I bought these headphones hoping to find great sound quality for a low price. I reasoned that if the speaker was ported directly into my ear canal, I would not lose any sound to the surroundings (as in open-ear designs).<br />This turned out to be true, they offer excellent isolation, and I hear all the nuances of the music. Unfortunately, the size of the drivers negates any advantage that the isolation offers. The small surface area of the speakers makes the music sound very papery. The sound quality is definitely an improvement over the stock headphones packaged with most music devices, but it still sounds cheap and unappealing.<br />Many reviews emphasize the importance of proper insertion, and I agree. Improper insertion yields horrible sound. My problem with these headphones is exacerbated by their tricky insertion. It usually took at least 2 tries to place them properly. I don't want to screw around trying put a pair of headphones on, I just want to listen. I would not recommend this product to people who have difficulty with the foam earplugs available at concerts.<br />The thing that annoyed me the most about these headphones was something that I did not expect. The headphones seal your ear canal from the outside air, creating two separate areas. A slight movement of the headphones in your ear causes the speaker diaphragm to move in or out due to the difference in air pressure. This produces an extremely irritating &quot;crinkle&quot; noise, as if someone were crumpling cellophane. This was the most annoying thing in the world, and it happened *all the time*<br />The positives:<BR>Small, Blocks outside sounds, Pretty good bass.<br />The Negatives:<BR>So-so sound quality, Difficult to insert, Aggravating crinkle.<br />These headphones are more trouble than they are worth. If you are usually satisfied with stock headphones, you might like this set. If you find the stock set lacking, spend the extra 5-10 dollars and get a much better-sounding pair."
2181,5,"these headphones are fine.  if you are not spoiled rotten and have to have the best, these are fine and very comfortable"
2182,1,"I guess the 90-day warranty says it all.  My unit performed well for about that period and then gradually got worse.  <br />Now it refuses to play almost any CD I put in it.  When it works, it occasionally has highly distorted output, will get confused in the middle of a disc or will just switch off.<br />It's pretty much unuseable now.<br />So I go the Coby web page figuring it's still within a year of purchase, only to learn that after three months you're on your own."
2183,5,What are you talking about? This works perfectly fine. I've had no problems so far.They're very high quality discs as well.The images are very sharp and clear. Trust me. This is a good brand.
2184,4,"This is my first MP3 player and it's a good one. I use it all the time.<br />Prior to purchasing, I borrowed a friend's Rio (not sure which model or which year, but more than 3 years old). I decided to go with the Nomad because of reviews I have read here and at other reputable websites (specifically, a well-known consumer products review website). With the ... rebate, the price was unbeatable for a 128MB player that expands to 256MB. <br />My documentation explained how to turn it on/off, but I agree with a previous poster that documentation was generally lacking. <br />The software is okay...I had already loaded a music list onto my PC, then to my friend's MP3 player, using Rio's software. The music list transferred with ease, however trying to add new songs and consolidate them into my previously created list was not as easy as it should have been. I was expecting the software to be less complicated. I also found that the new songs I added did not retain their information (title, artist) in the song list on the player, though when the song is playing I can see it. <br />I like the headphones that came with the player, though after a while (45 - 60 minutes), they start to hurt my ears. Adjusting them usually helps. Good quality sound with them. I prefer these headphones to ear buds (don't stay in my ears) and I like that the band goes around the back of my head rather than the top.<br />Another good feature is the auto-shutdown, where the play turns off after a set amount of time, thus conserving the battery. Occasionally, this feature is annoying, as it shuts down too soon. If you had paused the song and it turns off, the player returns to the beginning of the song you had paused. If the battery dies, the player returns to the part of the song playing at the time it died. Nice feature, though I wish the pause/auto-shutdown worked this way as well.<br />I haven't used the Record feature, but this is a bonus in my opinion.<br />Not sure I would agree with 10 hoursof playback on 1 battery, but then again, I do use mine a lot and may have lost track of time.<br />Overall, a really good player at a great price."
2185,3,"I was looking at this item at Radio Shack for the last few weeks, and it went on sale for twenty dollars off. So I had the clerk plug it in and I popped in a MP3 OTR disc I was listening to on a RioVolt SP50 with earphones.<BR>Bottom line; It played the mp3s ok as far as I could tell, and I didn't expect it to display the title artist and album information, despite the fact that my thirty dollar mp3 Riovolt does.....It did list the directory number and file number, but that was a bare minimum needed to play a mp3 cd. It has a nice blue backlight..It worked ok but I don't know if it has any anti skip buffering, but only an issue here in earthquake prone San Francisco...It worked. We all are listening to Mp3s on computers..This was a very nice table radio player, for old time radio shows. As it is, OTR has bad audio to begin with. I can't imagine any music head enjoying any rock and roll on it, however, since it does not seem to be designed for loud booming sound. But for low volume stuff it is perfect. How much noise do you need, anyway?  I value peace and quiet, and this mp3 player fits MY bill."
2186,4,"I found this game had a fun plot and an interesting fighting system. A roleplaying game in which you need skill! The puzzles can range from really easy to really difficult. However, every moment of it is enjoyable. My only complaint is that the monsters could be a little bit more diverse. Still, the game is worth a shot at trying."
2187,5,"I got this MP3 player/recorder for a gift and it IS THE BEST. Like the review I haved read here, it is a bit difficult to install. Once the install issues passed (helped by the review talked about), it is a lot of fun to use. Very simple to manipulate and the sound quality is better than I immagined. It is not an home theater system, but for a \\""walkman\\"", it's pretty good. <br />I used it to record interviews so I would be able to retype them later, and the quality of playback is more than clear. It makes my day more enjoyable (more time to myself than taking notes). <br />I had purchased a Sony MD-Player/recorder, for more than 600$, and I realize now that it can't give me half of what the ripflash-plus can give me. Just the fact that the MD-Player has an optical port, can't allow me to upload from the player to my computer. So I had to listen with my headphones an then transcribe to my computer. With the ripflash-plus, and the Red Dragon software (be aware that you need to instruct the software your tone of voice) I play the file on media player and the soft translate it in words........ what a relief!!!<br />Pros: awesome gadget.<BR>Cons: not easy to install (but it's posible)."
2188,5,I bought this thing like 4 days ago and i connected it to my tv and dvd player and i swear if it wusnt for the nagging cats i might have believed i was at the movies. The max power gives it a great kick and the bass makes this system sound so beautiful i highly recomend this thing
2189,5,"I went looking for something contemporary and different for my bedroom. Started out by looking at some units by Sharper Image and other brands such as Sony, Emerson and RCA. The prices varied from [price range] for single disk units, in some cases [price] and higher for 3 disk units. <br />In comparing the units I found that even though the other brands advertised 3 disks or more, in certain instances not all the units had independent CD drives and relied on a rotating carousel or a moving CD head unit. This looked neat when switching disks but increased the time delay playing between CDs. With the independent CD Drives on the Scott unit, playing between CDs are almost instantaneous.  <br />The Unit itself is designed pretty solidly. From the smooth motion sensing - translucent blue glass door, to its cool blue backlit display and to the firm buttons on the control panels. Another plus, was the unit came equipped with AUX IN, Line Out and to top it off a Digital Out Jack so you can hook up a minidisk or CD recorder to the unit. <br />The Remote was designed to fit neatly in you hands with all the main function buttons within thumb reach. The only button that is missing from the remote is the sleep function, which is located on the unit anyway. <br />The Audio is pretty good for a unit of this price. On the other hand if you like deep bass you might want to get a powered sub and connect it via the Line Out jacks. The preset equalizer does a decent job.<br />Overall this is a great unit, if they had slapped the Sony or JVC label on there I would have believed it. The only caveat I have is the speaker design, could have been a little bit more aesthetically designed, but for the price I still gave it 5 stars. I am happy with this purchase and I am sure will be too. Go ahead... Get one... or  two ...."
2190,3,"Good features, great price. The sound quality is good although not very loud. I had some skipping & static noise problems with MP3 CDs. When played on my DVD player the songs played fine. Also the skipping and static noise were not consistent. A \\""problem\\"" song played again would play fine. <BR>Otherwise a fine player and a good value for money."
2191,5,This mini system is the best 370 watts of pure power this acually creates a small earthquake it also has 5CD's. If you like to record tapes this the best one.It also is the best value for the buck.If you like it go to Circut city they have it for 339.99 the best price.
2192,1,"(...) It does not match with other pioneer line of products. It's music quality, especially in the low frequency range (Drums, sexaphone etc) is very very bad. However, it could be used as a bed side system"
2193,1,"Although it looks sharp it has a very short life span.  Mine lasted a year, and then it was KAPUT-- not functioning at all.  Before it died, only the CD player worked adequately.  The tape deck hungrily ate tapes, and the radio could pick up maybe five stations, AM and FM included.  I treated it gently, but it was destined to die an early death.  In my opinion, don't waste your money on it."
2194,5,"I recently bought this reciever off the internet for $200 to replace my aiwa that I've had for the last year and not really liked.  The aiwa did have an aux input with video hookup, and a video 2 and 3, but the sound quality was nowhere close to this reciever.  The sub out has a crossover setting that you can set for 100, 150, or 200, it should be 50, 80, 100 or something.  But everything sounds awesome.  The bass tone control is set at 100htz, which is more useful than aiwa's t-bass set at 45.  Everything sounds good on this reciever.  Could use a second video input or maybe s-videos would be useful. <br />No complaints with this unit.  Sound is awesome, all features work great.  Remote is useful, but kinda hard to use at times.  Instructions are kinda confusing too.  I recommend this reciever for anybody not wanting to waste the extra 1000 bucks on a reciever but wants great quality and sound.  An excellent buy."
2195,4,We bought this subwoofer (KLH ASW100) from Sam's Club for under $69.00 and after a little adjusting to match our system and our ears we have it performing quite well on our surround sound system connected to our satellite television system.  It adds a great deal of enjoynment to both the television programs as well as our video tapes.  We are really enjoying this item and feel that it was a great deal as well.
2196,1,"i got the phillips recorder 3 days ago.i was thrilled.one day after having it the sound when i played a disc was all distorted..awful sounding.after turning it off for a minutes it went away.then i recorded a song in fast speed..after playing the disc i noticed the sound on the recorded cd was all distorted on the last track..so i wasted 74 minutes on junk.then today i returned it ......came home plugged it in and the tray on the right side will not open,no matter what  i do..i called the philips 800 help line they told me to return it...AGAIN!!!!!!!!if this doesnt make you decide not to waste your money i dont know what will."
2197,5,I just recieved my YEPP today and nothing but good comments.  The software is extremely easy to use.  I had my mp3 player full in 15 minutes from opening the box and I am not what people consider smart.  The LCD screen is extremely easy to use.  It also includes useful extras such as the telephone book and voice recording.  The YEPP is the lightest and smallest audio player.  You do not notice it in your pockets.
2198,5,"This product is great, I looked at a few other models but this one was the right one for me, it comes with a carrying bag and lent cloth. in fact the reason why I went with Meade is because I bought a Meade model ETX-90EC  Astro Telescope both items are great. I use the Binoculars for shows or  concerts you can see every thing! thanks meade"
2199,5,This is an awesome cd player and the effects of it are great!  When you play one of your favorite cd's in this player you will actully feel like the band is playing the song right next to you live!  I highly reccomend  this cd player
