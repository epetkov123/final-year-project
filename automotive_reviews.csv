0,4,Excellent look and feel. Installation was easy my only small dislike was the exposed back portion of the rear seat cover.
1,5,Just what I needed for my cars!
2,5,Great value for the money! Product came new and was what described. I took parts to mechanic to replace and saved 500 dollars with parts and labor from what I was originally quoted.
3,4,It's cute
4,5,Perfect fit.
5,5,Shipping was fast. Few days and it was at my doorstep.<br /><br />The product was easy to install. About 5 minutes tops. Would recommend to anyone. Thanks guys.
6,5,"Best gadget ever! Hope I never have to use it, but if I do, I have one! It has a seat belt cutter, It helps to break out the car window. Great add on for you car emergency kit!"
7,5,Great
8,4,"I loved this with all of my heart and soul. I always felt like a #BOSS when people would get in my car and see my phone floating in the air. It matched my interior even if I didn't have my phone on it. I could not sing ENOUGH praises about this mount...<br /><br />... Until I took my case off and saw the back of my phone was scratched. You have the option to stick the magnet onto your phone, it's case, or just leave it between the two. For aesthetic purposes I decided on the last. Apparently that's the worst decision, because now my phone has scratches on the back. It's nothing too serious, but it bothers me enough where I feel the need to keep a case on 1000% of the time now. No more naked iPhone joy for me.<br /><br />So my suggestion would be to purchase a back screen protector (they sell those, right?) and hopefully that'll save your phone!"
9,5,and still bright as the brand name bulbs
10,5,GREAT FOR ALL ENGINES TO PROTECT THE METAL PARTS
11,5,Literally indistinguishable from the OEM part.
12,3,Only used it once sofar. Seems chincy. Not sumthing i would purchase to use alot
13,5,"Great Brakes! Great package deal! Lotsa bang for the buck. These seem to be of a much higher quality than the price would suggest. They arrived at my door in around 2 or 3 days, and were on the truck the same day. And the shipping was free as well!. Months later they are braking as smooth as day one.. The drilled/slotted rotors are really nicely machined, and seem to be of a high quality metallurgy too.. They never seem to be too oxidized after sitting for a while... I think they'll last a lot longer than the way more expensive ones I usually buy at my local parts stores.. Highly recommended!"
14,5,Great to use on swangers....
15,5,water tast real good
16,5,Perfect for my wife's CRV which we use for diving and the dogs
17,5,Everything I thought it would be !  Great price and right on time .
18,5,Great product.  Took a couple of trys to sync but it was easy and has good range.
19,3,"it really works only for a week, after that it was blurry again, basically you get what you pay for.. :("
20,3,"Shoei only warrants their helmets for 5 years from date of sale or 7 years from date of manufacture, whichever comes first. The helmet I got was manufactured in November of 2012, so clearly these are OLD STOCK which isn't indicated anywhere in the item description.  I have a call into them to see if they have one manufactured within the last 60 months, but I doubt it."
21,5,"As descibed, good quality, and arrived on time."
22,5,excellent!
23,5,Good
24,5,I got too admit i was a bit nervous about ordering this muffler for a low price but i was surprized in the quality of this muffler it came in the mail pretty fast  nd in good condition ..i would def buy another one if i had too great product.
25,5,favorite! keep it on me everyday. I feel much safer at college
26,3,"We like the concept and the price, and it works but sometimes the image freezes for a second.  if you are very close to your target when this happens, you could hit it."
27,5,"Installed on a 2007 KLR 650. Easy install, though i did have to shave my throttle tube just a hair to get the right grip to slide on.  Also had to trim the ends of the grips to get them to work with my bark busters, but that only took a minute to do.  Fired them up and they get warm pretty quickly. The only downside was finding a good spot for all the extra wiring, but I tucked it under the tank, and the install looks clean and functions well."
28,5,Perfect replacement & easy to program.  Instructions included with purchase.  Easy to follow.
29,5,WORKS GREAT
30,5,"Back to original ride after 300,000 miles"
31,3,Bulbs give out the perfect brightness and are bright white.  Unfortunately I am getting a bulb out warning no my ram 1500.  Philips needs to make a canbus version of these.
32,5,Nice to find one that screws on instead of using sticky tape. Fits and looks great. Great product.
33,4,Look good - Easy install. Not as noticeable as I thought they would be.
34,1,"Returned the first one for being faulty. Got the same results with the replacment. Checked the product to make sure it was for my car and engine, it was. Stated it worked for 1999-2000 Jettas 2.0 but clearly it does not. Or, dare I say, the extremely low priced part was just junk to begin with. My conclusion came as I was driving and the car lost all power, was able to get it started but would not stay running. Pulled the maf harness from the sensor and voila! The car started. Actually ran better than it ever did with this maf installed. Idled rough but never stalled like with this sensor plugged in. Not even worth $28...."
35,5,Good so far
36,5,All ok
37,4,Easy install and a lot of light<br />Currently just using 2 of them for back up lights for a pickup<br />But I'll be using the rest of them soon
38,4,Started unraveling as soon as my husband put a beer in...
39,3,"Works great and it is a great color, but the lock symbol is already fading off two months later."
40,4,"Feels great!  I have a tendency to dig my fingernails into the steering wheel, and this prevents me from doing any permanent damage."
41,3,Work great can tell  different with the original key
42,3,My son loves it
43,1,"I'm disappointed, IT DOESNT FIT MY HONDA CBR 600RR I really was excited for the product to come and it doesn't fit. And it's a fake carbon fiber."
44,5,Awesome grip and low noise. Recommended.
45,5,"Nice size, went on easily"
46,4,good cranking power and fast shipping
47,5,"It works well enough, but somewhat inconvenient to have to raise hood to get at it."
48,4,The quality is great and is very comfy to grasp. The only reason one star off is because of the rubber smell even after washing and air drying it out in the sun. It doesn't smell too bad after washing but still leaves the smell on my hands.
49,5,Worked perfect no problems.
50,3,"I received the decal in a timely manor, and thankfully that it was the color i ordered. It has been on my jeeps windshield for months now, and covered regularly in mud. It has held up very well.<br />The issue in have with this decal is that it was double imprinted. You can see hi haters twice but only one set of letters were laser cut. It looks bad up close."
51,5,Everything Fine
52,5,You have to love Bilsteins. Always worth the extra dough. Make my old truck better than new.
53,5,Fit perfect
54,5,Part worked great
55,3,very thin plastic
56,5,cheap and works
57,5,GREAT PRODUCT
58,5,Came in within 2 days. Front one didnt line up with holes but aftet some drilling it fit perfect. And they look great
59,5,Just what I expected!
60,1,Does not fit CJ7 or YJs. Maybe you should add that to the description.
61,5,nice
62,1,"I have to admit the quality is good, but the first problem is the color is much more orange than gold.  Not as pictured.  The second and biggest problem with these is that they are advertised as adjustable, but they are still not suitable for small hands.  The closest/smallest setting on these is still farther out than my stock clutch lever on my 2014 Honda Grom."
63,5,Fit just perfect.
64,5,great!
65,4,They make it so easy to order.  With the pics of the bulbs and the color of bulb you what your orderin .
66,5,This worked perfectly!  My  truck bumper looks like brand new - was so easy to apply !!!
67,5,"look great, work well, easy to install"
68,3,It's Ok.
69,3,"Wasn't an exact fit, particularly between the seat backs"
70,5,Fit my 2005 WRX perfectly and fixed the P0031 CEL code.
71,5,Very nice product!
72,4,"Really helps take the pressure off my lower back, this has been extremely helpful in reducing pain from sitting at the computer for long periods of time working."
73,5,"Excellent shield, works great and looks even better.  I've had compliments on how &#34;cool&#34; my helmet looks because of it.  It provides decent relief from the bright Colorado sun, and is still ok for night riding.  It's a bit dark, but you can still see at night.  Being the reflective iridium, it can be a little difficult to see the knobs to install on your helmet, but I knew this going in, and it looks great.  The only other complaint is that I swear bugs are attracted to it, never used to have so many splatters on my clear shield!  However, it is still a nice shield, and I like it much better than my clear one."
74,5,worked perfectly and fixed my traction control light that was on
75,4,waiting to use it until I get my car rebuilt.
76,5,They fit great!
77,4,nice light
78,4,Great kit with just about everything you will ever need if stranded for a short period of time.
79,2,"I love, my lexen leds they set of my road king , just the right  amount, of lighting, looks sharp"
80,5,fit my 2004 ford focus perfectly!
81,5,It work awesome! Fit perfect and zipper and straps durable! It poured on way down and nothing was wet! Easy to put on and off and folders compact to store!
82,5,Satisfied...
83,5,works well
84,5,it is what it is.
85,5,Excellent
86,5,Fit perfect and better quality than the one that came with my exhaust.
87,5,"As advertised, nice fabric, looks good and works perfectly"
88,5,It's so cute......loving it '
89,5,"works great, easy install improved ride"
90,5,Easy to install and worked very good
91,4,"Well I'm about 80% happy. They look kick ass on my my truck when it's not raining. I've had these on my truck for a couple weeks and, well there's been moisture in my corners pretty much the whole time. They adjusted easily, they are a little brighter than stock. I will be ordering different corners cause it kills the front end of my truck"
92,5,Perfect fit on the 2012 BMW 528i RWD
93,5,Happy
94,1,JUNK
95,4,Handy to have to hold drinks.
96,5,Very cool product at good price. Thanks. ✫†✫ Visit www.Lord-Jesus-Christ.com ✫†✫
97,5,Always use it.
98,5,Great wide angel mirror
99,5,"Good product , easy install"
100,5,"Great product.  Not like the flimsy ones in auto parts stores.  Well worth the price, looks great on my truck."
101,4,OK
102,5,Looks great and came on time
103,5,Good
104,5,High quality and works great.
105,5,"Great product!!  Use mine on the pillion seat fastened to the sissy bar on my Road King.  The lumbar support was fantastic.  Just took it to Sturgis, SD, and back, riding about 4300 miles with it.  Large roomy, and with my application, easy to use/secure.  I'd definitely recommend to a friend."
106,5,This light came as described and very well packaged with a excellent price .
107,5,Adds a clean look to the interior very happy with my purchase
108,5,"I put these on a 2013 KLR650. Worked great. I'm 6'2&#34; - 190#. The stock bar height was just too low. Very uncomfortable for both highway and off road, especially standing. I had to eliminate a cable tie or two to keep everything moving free. I really didn't think a 1.2&#34; riser would help all that much, but it did. They look good. My bars and top tree are black, so they look almost factory. My only problem was the shipping. They came from Oregon and went to New Mexico. Took almost 2 weeks. There wasn't any other shipping options, just USPS. No next day, no 2nd day, no express, no choices. I like to get what I order ASAP, regardless of cost, just that kinda guy. All that aside, the risers are just what you need if you're a little taller than average. Try these before you go with the 2&#34; pivoting, more expensive ones. I think you'd have cable issues with those anyway."
109,5,"With the fire burn bans this has made camping enjoyable. Absolutely love it.<br /><br />Pros: Nice flame, warm, light, hose lenght, and small,<br /><br />Cons: Loud (breather valve hisses), small"
110,5,I was very satisfied!
111,5,Just perfect for what I needed. I needed a short hose for my water softner install. Arrived quickly.
112,5,"I purchased two of these to dry my dogs after their baths. They are so much easier to use than bath towels. It only takes one to dry each dog instead of two regular size towels. I love the fact that I can squeeze the water out and use it again and again until the dog is dry. I then rinse each one in warm water, ring it out again and store. My husband couldn't believe that something stored damp wouldn't attract mold and mildew, but they don't. I just wish they made them in a larger size."
113,1,"One spark plug done, and the extration tip is so worn it won't grip a second plug. 60 bucks is a little steep for a one and done tool."
114,5,Very Nice
115,3,Not the quality expected for the price. These aren't bad but they are definitely not great. The shades are very thin and doesn't provide enough protection due to the fact that they still let a lot of sin get through.
116,5,works great this gasket.
117,1,These brakes did not fit as specified (2010 VW Jetta TDI).
118,3,It work what suppose to
119,5,"Yes, yes, yes, buy this for your license plate light(s).  As long as trigger-happy cops like to use an tiny insignificant violation like a burned out license plate light to pull you over for no real reason, it pays to virtually eliminate the risk altogether even at $10 a pop.  Sylvania is the real deal.  Don't trust the off-brands if you don't want trouble."
120,5,"Barefoot Graphic did a great job with this design and with customer service response. Had a little hiccup, but they took care of the problem promptly. Now, for my opinion of those who reviewed this product, give it a bad rating, without buying it. They need to mind their own business. Don't write about your political correctness junk on this review section . If you don't like it, don't buy it. I'm sure there is a &#34;BUCK FUSH&#34; sticker somewhere on Amazon."
121,4,It's a chain and it works good. I used it on my go kart and it seems to be working great
122,5,Good durable battery
123,5,"Excellent, just as pictured and just as described, nice and heavy and nice and shiny"
124,5,Great filter good price
125,4,Fits the front window of my car perfectly.  Only wish it were a little more pliable.
126,5,"I honestly had no idea a tool like this exsited until I came across it while browsing Amazon. As soon as I saw it, I had to have it. This is a precautionary tool for me, and thankfully, I haven't had to use it on my own vehicle. Having said that, I wanted to test it out once it arrived, and my father has a few junkers lying around and he allowed me to test it out on the passenger side window. I really expected there to be hesitation and a lot of force needed to break the window, but Tools of Life has made a product that truly works. I hit the window with what I'd call &#34;medium force&#34;, meaning I didn't really exert myself, and to surprise, it shattered that window that a professional baseball player had taken to it. It's my opinion that every family, or anyone, with a car, should HAVE to have one of these. The peace of mind it gives is invaluable. I keep mine in my purse at all times, because my purse is ALWAYS with me. Should there ever be an emergency, I'm covered."
127,2,"It's awesome, but with regular use, the pictures fade after about a year, which is actually pretty disappointing because it's not cheap compared to other more generic versions of steering wheel covers."
128,3,seems to do the job
129,5,"I put these pipes on my 2013 Kawasaki Vulcan VN900 Custom.  They went on easily and sound GREAT!  Strongly recommend getting the Cobra Fi2000 PowrPro Tuner and Cobra PowerFlo Air Intake Kit and putting everything on at the same time.  I got all three installed easily in a couple hours.  They work extremely well together and have given the bike extra, sustained performance.  NO - I do not work for Cobra."
130,4,I purchased 1 and i loved it so much that i purchased 2 more. i gave it 4 stars because it has no grip.
131,5,Perfect.
132,5,"great parts and well designed. Fit perfect. Only issue took no Amazon prime, slow delivery, but price was right!"
133,5,good distribute!
134,5,For the price compared to quantity you can not go wrong here.<br />Relays are great it you want to switch higher voltages on or off using a small voltage.<br />These are rated at up to 240 volts. I have only tested 120 and it worked flawlessly.<br />I can switch them on and off with a 5 volt microcontroller.
135,5,"Best I can say is you get a great price and quick delivery. Marine grease is marine grease, if you get my meaning."
136,5,"It arrived with a defective pump, the contents dribbling out from the pump handle. What I was able to try is a completely inferior product when compared to Zanio's or even Mother's detail spray products.<br />Garbage....one star only because it's the lowest rating allowed<br />Ok, I was a bit upset that the first time I used it the spray trigger exploded in my hand and all over the place, so that first review was a bit of an emotional one. I have used it since and have to admit it is as easy to use with similar results as the Zaino product I have used extensively in the past, good product, sorry for the over reaction..."
137,5,Best price I have found for this item.
138,5,"Everything for install was included. High quality aluminum. My pop up camper will love this, and so will my trans."
139,5,got these for my 2005 Toyota Avalon and love them.  Fits prefect looks awesome.
140,5,This spare tire hoist/holder fit perfectly on my 2003 GMC Envoy.It was just what I needed to get the spare tire out of the back of my suv.I would order again from Dorman.
141,4,"Half the price of Oreilly auto for the same, part.  Ceramic=less brake dust.  Fits the vehicle."
142,5,"I love these lights!  I always get compliments and asked where I got them.  I did have to back down the wattage on the lights.  We started out just a little too bright for my taste.  Once we replaced with 15 watt bulbs, it was perfect.  Great Product!"
143,1,"Based on my experience, this quality of this product is poor.  It flops lops over and does not remain stiff and in windshield.  As a result, I consider the product to be useless and would not buy it again."
144,4,it worked ok
145,5,Perfect fit replacement.<br />I'm surprised that GM hasn't made a detail change to this model van.  Auto designers seem to change things just to be changing them sometimes.<br /><br />Not only was the part exactly the same the color was too!
146,2,"Giving 2 stars as it will not be an issue if hit by foliage when off roading as far as height, and I do get in some stations most of the time, BUT my reception is generally atrocious!  In all fairness, I do live in the pines, so radio signals are not necessarily the strongest, but it's not super snug when screwed in, and even in more areas it doesn't pick up much."
147,5,great quality and price!
148,5,Along with the baron big air kit cleaning up he clutter.  These two side pieces dressed the area up with minimal detraction from the engine. Great!
149,5,"work like a charm, Thanks"
150,2,"These are pretty cool - but they don't always work.  I purchase two sets of these, and I have one stem that works great.  But - they are so cheap - if you really want them, then just purchase multiple packs to get a couple that work."
151,5,"good quality, simple, not overly hot or ackward"
152,5,Perfect fit on my Lexus IS250 and very good material. Good stopping power and they include all the hardware.
153,5,very easy to install
154,3,"Received this product today. Shipping was fast, packaged well, had issues putting it on. The front bucket seats went on perfectly. Looks great, the back seat though was a nightmare. The bottom goes on just fine. The back part of the back seat doesn't work. Nothing lines up like it's supposed to. After about an hour in the heat we made it work. We had to make holes for the headrests to hold the back part that just sagged. We made it work and it looks good. Haven't had anyone back there yet to truely test it out though. The fabric snags/catches some as well. All the head rest covers fit perfectly. I love the colors. And love the feel of the item.  Had a struggle with my Toyota rav4. But it eventually worked."
155,5,"Exactly what I ordered, exactly what I needed. Thanks!"
156,5,"At first I was just as skeptical as another reviewer on here thinking &#34;With all of these good reviews and barely any criticism, this company had to have hired paid reviewers&#34;, but I went out on a limb and tried it anyways. I am glad I did. This thing works wonders. I have had the leather chamois in the past and they seem to dry out and get brittle pretty easily and I have had other synthetic chamois in the past that didn't work worth a darn, but this is like the best of both worlds. It works as well as any high dollar chamois that I have had in the past and if you keep this in its container I don't believe it will dry out any time soon. As an added bonus the company checks with you within days after your order to see if you are satisfied. They actually seem concerned about their customers! I will be purchasing more of these in the future as gifts and to keep around the house."
157,1,Very poorly made
158,3,"The carbon fiber style bar ends for my 2009 Gsxr 600 look great on my bike! I only have one con about them. Instead of having an allen key type of screw in them, they have a phillps head screw so it's a lil hard to screw them in really tight without stripping the screw. Other than that they're a great addition to my bike. I would recommend getting them if you need a pair."
159,4,simple and easy to use. provided the data i needed.
160,5,Great
161,5,"Bought this to use on porch/deck of cabin on a lake.  Looks great, rain goes right through, lays nice and flat, doesn't blow up in the wind.  I think we will be able to use for many years."
162,5,Very good product.
163,5,"Soft, smooth and fit a 2003 Durango pretty well."
164,5,"These are super solid tusks, but the instal isn't very easy. But overall i'm very happy with them."
165,5,Great..thx
166,3,"Great sounding pipes, but get VERY VERY VERY VERY HOT and instantly discolor."
167,5,fit perfectly on frig. draen
168,1,"I was very disappointed with the shipment of Archoil AR6400D professional diesel fuel system cleaner that I received. I ordered at the same time two bottles at $25.49each. These were delivered separately, one day apart.  One bottle was ok, but the other bottle that I received was either old stock or counterfeit. If you look at the attached pictures, you can clearly see the differences between the two bottles:<br /><br />1) Pic 1 (front label): Bottle on the left has a glossy, professionally printed label. The label on the bottle to the right has a dull, worn out label that looks like it was printed on ordinary paper. Note the glossy label has rounded edges while the old/fake(?) label has square edges.<br /><br />2) Pic 2 (back label): Similar comment as in Pic 1. Furthermore, if you look at the middle portion of the bottle on the right, it seems the instruction section was misprinted.<br /><br />3) Pic 3 (overhead, cap off): Bottle on left is sealed. Bottle on right has no seal. this resulted in some spillage inside the package. I do not plan to use the contents of the unsealed bottle as it could be contaminated with substances that could harm the fuel injection system of my vehicle."
169,5,"Looks amazing and all of my Whovian friends love it too. The blue really stands out on your car and its easy to read. My state (the same as the picture) doesn't use any tags so it doesn't block anything for me but I would be careful and check for your own state or country's laws. And don't worry, you wont get into trouble or having the word &#34;police&#34; on your car because you are not trying to impersonate an officer. 10/10 would recommend. I like this one way more than the metal unofficial ones."
170,5,"if you have kids you can appreciate how handy this can be. of course you could use a bag, but this doesn't just fall over, spill, or look as cheap!"
171,5,Parts were on time even early. They work great.
172,3,"these are too big for the toyota corolla, and I even asked.."
173,1,It was the wrong size for my car. I needed one to fit a '98 Honda accord.
174,1,"I installed these on my 2003 Silverado.  In less then a years time they were warped.  The truck is not used for towing, only light hauling occasionally.  After 11,000 miles I am going to have to replace them.  Save your money and buy something of better quality."
175,5,Great item
176,5,good quality
177,5,excelente
178,5,easy to install
179,5,"very happy with it, was a birthday present"
180,5,Prof of all 2 years working
181,5,We have the only Kia with a mat black on the hood. Looks great thanks
182,5,Works well.
183,4,Works well
184,5,Its a belt and it works
185,5,Perfect....
186,1,had to send back did not fit my 2004 sieanna van
187,5,Working perfect
188,5,Great addition to hear the motor open up and improve throttle response.
189,5,Works great on my 2002 Bonneville. A good thing to have in your car just in case.
190,5,very useful
191,5,Good product..
192,2,"UPDATE: The product overheats! I've used it a few times, for which I'm grateful, but last two or three times it doesn't even pump one tire. Just shuts off. The instructions say wait 30 minutes. Bought this one (http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B002ZBWKAU) for my wife, and it's much better. It automatically stops where you tell it to, does not over heat, and it's cheaper! Going over to buy the second one.   I've used this pump twice already, because I always seem to drive over nails and other things that puncture my tires. It works great! It doesn't go up to 35 psi for some reason, but it gets me to 30, which is good enough to get to a gas station. I used this repair kit (http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AMOEGY) twice with this pump. Works like a charm, my friends were really impressed when we drove over a nail and the tire was fixed within 10 minutes. Highly recommend having this in your trunk."
193,4,What's to review.
194,1,"The shades arrived on time. Perfectly packaged. Unfortunately the passenger side front vent started to develop a small crack in it after a few days of my truck sitting in the heat. The window started to stop whenever I closed it. I verified it was in place and a day later a 2 inch chuck broke off and the shade fell off as I pull out of my parking space at lunch. I'm attempting to contact Amazon for a replacement. Otherwise, they're the best looking vents I've seen and fit perfectly and look fantastic on my truck. I would recommend them in spite of this mishap. I know it sounds like I didn't install it properly, but it was perfect and I followed the instructions and let it sit in the sun all day after installation and didn't roll down the window for 48 hrs. Revised 8/7/15: I had to return them again for a refund. The passenger front fell off while driving and shattered. I realize it's the instructions that are flawed. They tell you to leave the tip (toward the front) outside of the weather strip. One the driver side -no problem. Passenger side apparently the weather strip isn't strong enough to hold the shade without grounding it in the channel. The instructions tell you to leave it outside the channel at the tip. Bad idea. The front shades should have a strip of double sided tape on them as does the rear. Update 8/20/2015 I had to return the vent shades since the one on the passenger side front fell out while I was driving and shattered. I will not recommend this product nor purchase again"
195,5,"With seven people and eight cats, it seems we get an awful lot of dust. Not that I'm surprised, but it does call for needing to dust and needing a good way to do so. I love that these are washable, and easy to use! I was sent these to try and give my honest opinion on. They've done exactly everything I've needed, and capture dust VERY well. My son is thrilled, because he actually wanted something like this because he wanted to dust for me. Don't ask, kids are strange sometimes, but hey more power to him right?!<br /><br />I've had mits before for dusting, but they've actually fallen apart pretty easily. Not this brand, but another brand bought at a nearby store. These ones seem like a much better quality, and I expect that they're going to last me awhile!"
196,3,"Seems to have at least sealed a small chip I've had, but it still looks chipped.  The instructions are pretty intense though, but it beats having to deal with the insurance company."
197,5,great product highly recommended
198,5,Sunforce 82120
199,4,Nice bulbs :)
200,5,Item as expected. Fit our vehicle and easy to install!
201,5,I love it!  It not real leather.  It does look like it.  Very easy to put in the car.  Shipping was quick.  Only problem the shipper did not respond to any of my questions.
202,5,Very detailed graphics. Easy to apply.. Looks great on the back of my motorcycle helmet.
203,5,Very easy to use
204,5,"I think this is actually for Honda's Recreational Vehicles but wanted something nice for our new Honda SUV's tow hitch. This is nice solid rubber type material, fits in firmly but not so much that removal is an issue. Personally I like that it doesn't stand out, the black material without any chrome or paint blends nicely."
205,5,Easy to sync. Just as described. Works perfectly.
206,5,I needed a way to use an electric air pump indoors. This was a very cost-effective alternative to buying an AC-outlet pump; I just use my car's air pump.  This converter doesn't run hot and it does provide a steady current as far as I can tell.
207,3,Takes little modification.. cutting it to fit..
208,3,Not machined very well but it works. It looks like a bent frisbee whereas the stock trigger disk looks perfectly flat. I'm concerned that disk is grinding away at the distributor.
209,4,So far it hasn't shredded or left fuzz all over my clothes.  Otherwise looks well and is soft.  It's not real sheepskin.
210,5,Awesome price... the sensor did fit tight with the harness but it took a little getting into. When I compared it to the factory original the side tabs were a little off. Verified the part numbers on the sensor and factory sensor itself and they were the same so it was a little odd that it was off a bit. Otherwise so far so good.
211,5,"Just got deleivered and looks better than the pictures. Installation was easy except for the chrome screw caps- they fought me and I thiught they didnt fit, but I pushed hard on them and they snaped on just like the instructions said they would. Im quite happy with the quality and shipment speed of this item. Overall the frame was pricy but well worth the extra bucks."
212,5,[[VIDEOID:17f121d161f9aeb559f32d30bc6497ba]]My son installed this to his H3 Hummer and couldn't be happier! It not only lit up the road in front of the truck but more importantly lit up the side of the road and ditch. This is a real safety benefit when it comes to seeing the deer before they pop out of the ditch and onto the road without warning.
213,5,"I have recommended this product to many friends, the first glass cleaner that leaves absolutely no streaks (provided you do not use rags that have fabric softener on them).  I also spray some on a cloth use to clean our glasses and phones.  It does not leave a  &#34;cleaner&#34; smell that you want to get rid of, after smell is simply a clean smell (if there is really much of an odor at all).  I will be repurchasing this product."
214,5,"We love Camco, we have bought many of their products and are always please, the quality and function are great!"
215,1,"The mesh fabric is really scratchy on the back of your legs if you're wearing a skirt or shorts.  That's annoying.  It's also too small.  I'm 5'8&#34;, 135 lbs, so not a person with a big butt, and it's still too small for me.  It digs in to the back of my thighs.  It relieves the pressure points on my tail bone, but creates a new pressure point on my legs, so that's not particularly helpful.  If I scoot it forward to relieve my legs, part of my rear end hangs off the back.  The gel inside itself is nice, but the rest is lousy.  Don't waste your money."
216,5,"Really great!  Best seats covers ever. My husband loves them , they hold up to the toddlers and we get a lot of compliments on how nice they look and feel."
217,5,"Simple and easy to follow instructions. Installed in minutes. Reduced the weight feel of my 2004 Super Duty Ford tailgate by &#34;wow, what a difference&#34;."
218,5,Great product
219,5,Fit great!
220,5,Very pleased with this paint. HOK is some of the best urathaines on the market for airbrushing an custom paint jobs. It does need to be reduced a little (I used shop line which is comparable) but other than that it flowed great through my .5mm iwatas.
221,5,perfectly fits.
222,5,Fit my cigarette lighter port perfectly.
223,5,Fit my 1999 Buick Regal and arrived faster than expected.
224,5,Perfect.  Now I know where the registration and insurance card is!!!  Sometimes old is better.
225,1,This item was ordered after using one on loan that worked very well. After receiving the order I tested the device and all seemed well. The document that came suggested the battery charge should be topped off about every two months. Today was my first top off charge and it was down just a bit. Two hours later I checked and discovered that the battery had bulged and the case was pushed out considerable. This was the first top-up charge attempt. I am an electronic technician and know how to manage battery powered devices. After owning the Brights Compact Mini Portable charger for only 10 weeks I discover that it is not eligible for return even though the document accompanying it states it is warrantied for 12 months from date of purchase. If I could assign zero stars I would.
226,5,Loved these in my bmw e46- no break dust
227,5,"Very good fit, seems to be high quality"
228,5,"We have three GM vehicles (Monte Carlo, Impala, GMC Sierra) that these 22&#34; Beam blades fit. I have installed them on all three- very good wiping action and sticks to the glass at speed. I hope they are long lasting as well; for that we will see. But very happy with the blades. Installation of all of these is a little tricky; just take your time and be very observant of the way the old ones are mounted. Then,  carefully see the instructions in the package of the new blade. You will usually need a small screwdriver to pop open the latch."
229,4,"These look nice but one fell off after a month.  It may have been user error in application, I'm not sure.  We will try to reattach it at some point."
230,4,excellent price. very fast shipping high quality product. very happy with my purchase
231,5,"big, comfortable, well made, nice vibration options, nice heat, great price  my guy really likes it for back troubles."
232,4,lights are not quite as bright as Iexpected. I am happy with the product.
233,5,"Great quality - just what I expected.  Using this to fuse 12V lateral circuits on my landscape lighting.  I haven't finished the project yet, but this fuse block using small amp fuses will be perfect."
234,4,"For my hardtop on my '84 CJ-7, as described, as I hoped. Handy design."
235,2,"I first bought one of these rugs in 2011. It lasted 3.5 years on our deck, in sun, rain and snow. I wanted a different color so I bought the (beautiful shade of) blue one this spring. It arrived March 28. I put it on the deck, same spot as the last one. On Saturday, July 4, I noticed it was worn way down in one spot. On Sunday, July 5, I tried to lift it up to clean the parts that had worn away and the entire thing disintegrated. The rug shredded. Not only was it destroyed, but it made an enormous mess on our deck that took a full hour to clean up. This rug lasted 3.5 MONTHS and then disintegrated."
236,5,fit perfectly. works well.
237,5,It fie and works great
238,2,"This cover installed easily and we were happy with it for almost a year. As stated in other reviews, it did have a bumpy look, but it wasn't too bad. Then yesterday, driving on the interstate we heard a loud whoosh and it was gone off into the air and way off into a farmers field. We first thought that we had installed it wrong, but the plastic clips had detached from the cover. Scary experience and we will not be buying something with plastic clips again."
239,5,"Great, worked for what I needed it for."
240,4,"I take care of two granddaughters daily, and when I received a coupon for this item at a reduced price for an honest review, I was excited. It seems that the crayons, paper, toys, etc., have taken over my car, and any chance to keep everything organized was welcome. This organizer has a combination of mesh and fabric pockets which are good sizes for storing things. The fabric is sturdy and the construction is good. There were no loose threads or seams anywhere. The side mesh pockets are especially nice since they can be cinched closed. My older granddaughter's pads of paper fit well in the larger pockets, and as installed, she can easily access her things from her booster seat. The only reason this did not receive five stars is that when installed as directed, there is an elastic strap around the front middle of the passenger seat which means this seat cannot be used with out removing the organizer. It isn't a huge problem on a daily basis as it is almost always the two girls and me, but when I do have a passenger, I have to take it off. It would be a really good addition for someone who travels for work and uses a vehicle as an office and wants to keep business things organized in the passenger seat."
241,1,This heater would not heat a small garden tractor engine to 5 deg. F. above ambient temp. and rusted immediately putting rust particles into the engine cooling system.
242,5,"I got this for my boyfriend cause his old lanyard was getting dirty looking. He loves cars and his favorite is Toyota. We both own them. When I bought this I had no idea his Toyota would be dead by the time the lanyard got here. His car was pretty old with almost 300thou miles on it. it was expected. So it was kind of a sad gift to give to him. He still really enjoyed it and he still replaced his old lanyard with it. The material is very soft and bumpy. Feels like it was made well. It looks fresh and clean, lettering is so bright white! (just like picture) I just hope he doesnt get this one all scuffed up! I need a lanyard I hope I can get one with this material."
243,5,works well
244,5,Nice valves and good price.
245,5,"Excellent transaction, Quick delivery, Product as stated. Highly recommended!"
246,5,"Bought this more or less to compare to the RoadPro. Will probably last forever as a result of the micarda construction. Could stand a bit more weight, but good product otherwise."
247,5,great product
248,5,Perfect fit and very durable.  Easy to install. Less expensive than the competition.
249,3,Fits but not much support.
250,5,"Very good quality, good installation instructions; simply follow the instructions."
251,1,I don't like it
252,5,got roller with dyno mat ordered works well need for project.
253,5,Nice
254,5,Same as original. Everything lined up. Works well so far.
255,5,It was great
256,5,Worked perfectly
257,5,Exactly what I was looking for!
258,5,This is the best thing we got for our motorcycles
259,2,"The front flaps are ok, but the rear are different from picture. They don't have holes for bolts, and they constantly fall..."
260,5,"It was easy to assemble and attach to the hitch on the back of our minivan.  We almost don't even notice it's there when driving.  This rack is sturdy, well built, and has survived numerous trips without any problems.  It has a 500-lb cargo capacity, but that much weight on this long of a torque arm loads the back end of our Honda mini-van too much.  Don't expect to get more than about 250-lbs on it if you have a typical mini-van.  Perhaps if it's mounted behind a truck, then it could be loaded to 500-lbs."
261,5,Great light. Has a clear bright light.
262,5,Nice replacement for 2 rubber flap plugs on the motor home that go for over $6 each.<br />I primed these with self etching primer and top coated with auto paint to match the camper.<br />Wish the lanyard was about half as long.
263,4,These worked fine but seem to be pricey.
264,5,"This is an amazing sticker: heavy duty for use on the outside of a window, thick for durability, and funnier than hell! Exactly what I was looking for and has measured up to my expectations. Thank you Sticky Pig! I will be back."
265,2,The brushed direction is width direction instead of length direction as pictured.
266,5,"product as described, Would buy again."
267,5,Work great.  Very bright.  Good quality.
268,5,It worked like it was supposed too!
269,5,"This was exactly what I need to replace the broken heater knob on our 2004 Honda Odyssey EX.  It fits flush to the dash and matches the other AC knobs perfectly.  The price was a bit more than I was wanting, but it was cheaper than going to the dealership and getting raked over the coals for a freaking knob."
270,5,"[[VIDEOID:2e9059c88d682e78de07962396ebcb17]]This Afterpartz Light Bar works very well, mounted on top of the tubular front bumper on our 1998 Jeep. The light bar is solidly built, easy to install, bright and a perfect fit for our bracket because it's mounts are made to slide to where you need them. My son and I like this light bar very much, and we would recommend it to others.<br /><br />The size of the light bar we received fit nicely on our Jeep; 20 inches long (left to right, from outside edge of the casing), 2.25 inches tall, about 2.25 inches deep (front to back of casing), and the mounts lift the bar about 1 inch above the mounting surface. There are 12 LED lights built in to this bar, and the unit weighs about 3.5 pounds per our postal scale. It seems substantially built.<br /><br />Since the Jeep had an old pair of driving/fog lights already installed on the front, there was already a wiring harness in place for us to use as a template for putting this additional light bar on. We just lined up the new harness (included - and very good quality) and put the two harnesses side by side in the engine compartment. Only tight spot was working the lead through the firewall, but we worked it out.<br /><br />Really was not a difficult job:<br /><br />* Decided where to mount this light bar<br />* Ran the wiring harness wires to the new light position<br />* Laid down the new wiring harness along side of the existing one, and then installed it<br />* Connected leads to the battery, ran switch's pigtail through firewall, reconnected switch to wiring harness<br />* Connected the wiring harness to the light<br />* Tested the light to make sure all connections and switch operated as expected<br />* Used good quality electrical tape to seal up the wiring connections<br />* Zip-tied the wiring in place where needed to keep things from flapping around<br />* Hit the road<br /><br />All told, this took about 60 minutes and that included testing out a couple other lights too... and some of that time was figuring out exactly where we wanted the light bar to go. Quick. Easy. Effective.  It is nice that the push button on/off switch has a little green LED to let you know that the lights are on, and it also has a little red LED to confirm they are off... I would prefer no light when off, just so the light isn't drawing battery power when the Jeep is turned off. Still, that's minor and has not given us any trouble.<br /><br />This light bar seems to be very high quality, and once mounted it sits rock solid. We took a video of the finished product so you can see what they look like on our Jeep.<br /><br />If you are looking for a quality light bar of this size, construction, brightness and style, for use as I have described above, then my son and I would highly recommend giving this Afterpartz 60W Light Bar a try based on our fun experience with it. Was a great father & son project and we have had fun with the light.<br /><br />Very recommended.<br /><br />Go for it.ht bar to go. Quick. Easy. Effective.

271,5,Rides good. Looks killer. Great value and easy install. Did the front and rear on my garage floor in 2.5hr
272,5,We are pleased with the company that provided this part and the product. It took less than five minutes to install... Okay eight minutes.
273,5,Nice shocks for my old 58 Chevy at a great price!
274,5,Nice heavy duty clamps.
275,4,Lights are pretty bright for the price. The only thing I had a problem with is it does not have a memory to store which flash pattern you selected. Every time you turn it on you have to find the flash pattern you want to use.
276,5,Great product for the price
277,5,Looks fantastic on my Jeep Liberty. Applied easily!
278,5,Fantastic bright lights.
279,1,Looked like a good rotor when I received it but did not fit my 2012 Toyota Rav 4. The rotor was about 1/2 an inch too large. The bolt holes on the caliper and wheel hub would not match up. Found out at the dealer and had to put my new pads on old rotors. Very dissatisfied with Amazon motor vehicle parts. This is the 2nd misfitted item I have received. The description advertised and advised that the part would fit my vehicle.
280,5,Just an excellent unit. Works better than one more expensive but time will tell.
281,5,good product
282,3,"I installed one of these on my truck five years ago, and it's held up well. One reviewer complained that the plastic box is attached to the mounting plate with two-sided foam tape, and I can assure you this is not a problem. This truck is kept outdoors and is a working four wheel drive that we use off road all the time, and it's held up well for a bit more than five years. Three years ago I got stuck fording a stream and it was completely submerged for ten hours until I managed to get someone to pull me out, and it was mounted on the bottom of the bumper where it hung down (this proved a mistake, for reasons I will go into later) where it took a lot of abuse on rough trails and constantly being pelted with dirt, gravel, rain and anything else thrown up by the tires, all of which it shrugged off with no damage, so rest assured; it is plenty rugged and will last.<br /><br />I am now shopping for a replacement, as it and the back bumper were badly damaged in an accident. However, I plan to upgrade to the Tow Ready 118145 instead.<br /><br />The reason I don't like this one is that I want one that is just a tad larger, but my real complaint is that it is hinged on the top. This means that it opens from the bottom, and the problem with it I have had is that on trails the truck will occasionally bottom out, usually when it's loaded with all my camping gear and on rough trails, the lid of the box hits the ground and pulls it open, which allows the wires to fall out. I finally lost the harness completely when this happened and I didn't notice for 300 miles.<br /><br />I was planning on getting another and I was going to mount it higher up somewhere on the undercarriage, even if it's further away and less convenient, but for a couple dollars more the Tow Ready is a bit larger and is hinged on the top; meaning it won't open when it hits the dirt.<br /><br />Oh, you could turn it upside down, but you have to drill another hole big enough for the connector to pass through either in the plastic or the bracket, and that would result in less surface area for the tape to hold grab onto, and the Tow Ready box doesn't require modification. And it's slightly larger, which is another consideration.<br /><br />This box is good and worth the money, it really is. I do advise anyone who purchases this to mount it someplace higher than under the bumper so it doesn't open when something hits it, especially on a 4x4 or a truck that has little ground clearance.<br /><br />I learned my lesson; from now on I will mount them higher up, even if it's in a less convenient location."
283,3,OK<br />RUSS
284,5,Definitely helped to lower my emission & pass my smog. Engine runs smoother after adding this stuff. Will see you again in 2 years.
285,5,Awesome
286,1,"This item did not fit the forward seat, wrong part."
287,5,Ok
288,5,Just installed and ride and stop smooth as silk. Also used Durastop professional rotors and the braking change is immediate and welcome.<br /><br />Use no other brake products than AC Delco professional grade. You will be glad you did!!!
289,1,I bought this piece becouse it said it would fit my car and it came and it is the wrong one it doesnt fit my  car...its the wrong one ..but what i dont understand is why when i put all my cars info in to check fit it still said this did fit my car
290,3,"This worked as well and just like they said it would. I'm only giving it 3 stars because of the way they packaged the buffing cream. There is enough cream to do an extremely good job on the lens 2X easily, but they put it in a little tear pouch. The problem with that is you have to device a way to keep the torn corner upright while you are applying it to the lens or the contents will spill out. Also if you don't use it all, you need to tape up the opening and put a clip on it to keep it from drying out.<br />This is a very annoying way to package the cream and if 3M wants 5 stars they need to put the cream in a tube or a bottle that has a cap on it so a person can squeeze the dime size drop easily and put the cream to the side while they work on the lens."
291,5,Item was as described. Installed with no issues.
292,1,"Not exactly what I expected. Quality standard is very low, material is very thin easily torn."
293,5,Worked on a Nissin 14mm Mcylinder. Parts seem high quality and matched perfectly the stock parts taken out. No issues.
294,1,"JUNK! do not buy, you get what you pay for!"
295,5,good product no issues
296,5,"These are wonderful! I live in a very dusty place and have a black vehicle so this really comes in handy. It doesn't just move the dust around, it sticks to the duster and the vehicle looks freshly washed.  Nice."
297,5,Best for my riding practice<br />:-)
298,5,"fast delivery, product fit as expected and works fine."
299,5,Use it on my c6
300,5,Just what i needed. Thanks!
301,5,Cool lookin .
302,5,this device helped me reset the TPMS on my 2014 Lancer Evolution X GSR. Note: you'll also need to buy the VT30 or equivalent
303,5,Great Buy!
304,5,its OEM. Enuff said
305,1,"Leaks, nothing spells disappointment like going to dump your holding tank, removing the cap and getting an arm full of waste water! Easy to install though, everything needed to replace the old one, including the leakage."
306,5,"Changed my elantra looks.....thogh the color black didnt much my black elantra....took it to the dealer and painted it using my car color code for real cheap........aftr all,this diffuser chnged my elantra"
307,5,I put this on my XL883 and they cured all my ills... Mind the length you get as it will change the hight from normal to low... I went 12.5 because I wanted the one inch drop (not a slam) so I wouldn't bottom out.  These are the HD (Heavy Duty not Harley Davidson) version so they are meant for handling a bit more weight.  I ride two up with my fluffy bride (I'm no skinny either) and these support well
308,5,Good
309,5,Yes
310,4,Very good and functional.  I wish it could hold more trash though.
311,1,Cheaply made poor fit don't waste ur money
312,5,Water filter for the rv good product
313,4,"I bought this for a '97 Toyota Tacoma, 4 cylinder, 2.4 liter engine.  My truck is as basic as it gets.  I should mention that I'm a true car DIY'er - not a mechanic at all.  I can change my oil, change my brake pads, done some exhaust and wiring work, installed my own stereos, etc - but I'm not a mechanic in the least.  So perhaps it was to be expected when this radiator initially threw me for a loop because it has two extra spots for small hose attachments at the bottom.  The instructions could have been better, calling out that these outlets were optional - for a good hour or two, I figured this radiator would not fit because I did not have any hoses to hook up below.  But it turns out, these inlet/outlets are optional and is a closed system, so if you don't have anything going in then nothing comes out.  With that clear, installation was a breeze.  I also changed the thermostat at the same time - probably a good idea if you're doing this, as they're very cheap (about $10), and if your radiator is old enough to need changing then your thermostat may not be far behind.  Always good to change the hoses as well at this time.<br /><br />Aside from the instructions not being made for a non-mechanic like myself, this worked flawlessly.  Truck is still doing great a few months later."
314,5,"Love it. Solid and looks great. Kind of a pain in the ass to assemble, the rivets are HD and tough to squeeze by hand. You'll be making faces and noises by the time you finish, unless you have a nice rivet gun. Definitely recommend."
315,4,I love the new jacks but I have a few issues. The jacks themselves are great but 1) the holes do not line up on my 5th wheel and 2) the tool to crank the jack broke on 1st use though a standard tire iron will work just fine. All I have to do now is drill an extra hole and it'll work. So much better than my older jacks.
316,5,fit perfect
317,4,"great,could have used instructions"
318,5,It worked as expected for the EZ pass !
319,5,I love this rug! It is a great size and lightweight.  It also has a fun pattern!
320,5,"It's awesome, I'm really happy"
321,5,"Works great, bright, seems well constructed. Just check all hex screws after unpacking, I had 4 or 5 that were loose."
322,4,Plug and play 👍
323,4,Worked perfectly with walker pipes and no engine codes
324,5,"Light, fits great (6' 218lb). Really perfect."
325,5,Awesome pads and no more break dust on my wheels.
326,5,Quality buy.  Thick walled metal bell
327,5,"Perfect fit with no drilling, installed quickly and easily. Very high quality workmanship. Anything from Weathertech is top notch. Worth every penny"
328,5,Great item.
329,5,"Really great value. Easily exceeds the ratings (tongue weight, etc) of my Scion itself, and is ripe for all manner of cheap Harbor Freight racks and trailers to connect up—your car becomes a small truck when needed."
330,5,Great fit very quiet.
331,5,"Great shipping speed, arrived 4 days earlier than expected. Very bright, easy hook-up. Wish they'd include 4 Command adhesive strips to secure the boxes, but overall the product is great."
332,5,I give this 5 stars without even leaving my driveway!! I bought 1 light for a &#34;backup light&#34; on my old 1973 Bronco...ALL I can say is this light is AMAZINGLY BRIGHT!!  I am seriously considering buying 2 more as side lights for night time wheeling or just 1 and attach a magnet to it for setting up camp at night...ALL I CAN SAY IS I WAS SHOCKED AT JUST HOW BRIGHT JUST ONE OF THESE ARE BY ITSELF!! Personally I do not think you would be disappointed at all...DO NOT WASTE YOUR 100.00S OF DOLLARS ON SOME LIGHTS...Just try these 1st! think about it &#34;what&#34; do you have to really loose if your not happy!... I think you will be extremely happy! I AM!!!
333,5,"Changed the oil twice on my road king now, very good works perfect. Best investment I ve made"
334,5,these are great
335,3,"I have a bmw m3 e46 series, I purchased both of the boots together, the material/ quality was very good. The boot for the E brake fit good,  but the boot from the shifter was too big, we had to cut and customized the boot8 to fit."
336,5,We placed it behind our trailer and it's just great!
337,4,"I bought these for my Dodge Grand Caravan and they work pretty good. These are not really adjustable like other blind spot mirrors because these only rotate. They are fixed at an angle so that when you rotate them, they should be able to show you enough of the blind spot area of your vehicle without having to push the mirror in or out. I like that they rotate because once I have them set where I want them, I can easily make a mark on them so that if they are moved for whatever reason(cleaning the mirrors, car wash, etc...), I can just rotate them back to that mark and they will be in the place I had them set.<br /><br />I can see the curb for when I am parking or making a tight turn and they help when backing up into a parking spot or garage. The only time they don't work so good is at night, which is to be expected. For seeing the curb they work great.Helps to avoid a lot of close calls. Also helps in spotting bikers that are riding between cars in traffic.<br /><br />These are made of plastic but that's to be expected for the price. I've had them for about 5 weeks and they still work fine. Adhesive still sticks."
338,5,Works great! Fits like OEM!
339,2,Bought for a gift and couldn't get it to work as advertised. Very limited in apps compatiblity and limited data available. I'd recommend playing more for a better unit
340,3,Great color match but the nozzle was broken and it made the job very difficult and messy.
341,5,ok
342,5,Works fine great addition to my toolbox.
343,5,nice product
344,5,My second bag. Cant be without it! Perfect quality!!! Will get a third one soon!
345,5,"excellent!  used this to replace a brand new bosch sensor, after seeing several posts on a subaru forum that only the denso sensor works.  the bosch sensor did not keep the code from coming back, this one has been on for a few weeks now, and the code has not returned"
346,5,"Great led ice blue bulbs. For the price,  you can't beat it"
347,5,"Perfect,  as described."
348,5,"great product, fast shipping & easy to install."
349,5,Love it!
350,5,We love this light. You can see really well when this is lit up at night. Very easy to install as well.
351,5,Love these... :)
352,5,"This was a replacement for the water pump in my RV. This was not a direct replacement. I had to modify the piping in the RV to make it work. But, it works great!!!!"
353,5,"Great rack! Very, very , very sturdy. It surpassed my expectations and know this rack will last a life time."
354,1,Wrong part
355,3,"I was really excited about these seat covers! I read reviews and debated back and forth. I gave in and bought them. They shipped very quick and prompt! Packaged well! On the negative side... They didn't fit!!!! It was cheaply made at all seams and I had about a foot left of fabric with no seat to put it on. I drive a 2006 Chevy Cobalt Sedan so I have standard seats... No Bueno! The head rest alone I could have slipped over my own head! While attempting to put these I noticed the strong Chemical scent that many reviews had talked about. I can handle most things (Sharpies, Gas, Cement Glue)... but this smell gave me the worst headache I have ever had! It made my CHEST HURT!!!! I thought I would give it a couple days with the windows down and let it air out, but that didn't work. I could have might handles the not fitting perfectly but when the chest pains and headaches came... I had to send them back. The company responded quickly to my request and I am currently sending them back! I would love to say this is a great product but it needs some attention!"
356,4,"Received these this week.  They are new Yamaha originals in factory packaging, and fit exactly as they should.  I gave four stars because the prices for these simple plastic parts leave you with a bit of sticker shock.  Not a vendor issue, but a manufacturer issue."
357,5,Ok years easy
358,3,"these work with a little R&D work. first off, the brackets DO NOT work well on a Chevy Tahoe. there was absolutely no room to allen wrench the bolts to tighten the bracket. i had to go to the hardware store and get some bolts that i could use a wrench on. then even at the smallest setting for tightening, i had to use a shim to tighten it up enough so everything wouldnt move around. and when i did  that, i had to bend the bottom part of the back of the bracket in so that it didnt scratch to top of my Tahoe. but i got it to work and they were way cheaper than buying anything else. long and short of it is, if you are willing to do some work to these, its a good deal."
359,5,So glad I got it. Really changes the wind for the better off me on my 2006 Z750S. I can notice on side street and highways. Looks right at home too. Very happy. Was a bit skeptical spending so much but I'm glad I did.
360,5,does a fantastic job with very little effort
361,5,Installation was very easy and fit real good on my pickup
362,5,Not super bright but nice. Could be 2 more led for better coverage. But. Still really nice.
363,5,Before u buy make sure u do some measurements. Had to make alterations for my 2003 Honda odyssey. Lights also has a slight blue hue to them. Kinda like 8000k hid lights. But that's what I was going for.
364,5,worked great
365,5,exactly what I wanted
366,5,"It's working good, can't complain at all."
367,5,Did what it was supposed to do and I would recommend this product.
368,4,Fits great and looks great. You have to cut out for sub but they make that very easy
369,5,Holds well and adjusts to almost every size.
370,4,Take your time when applying.
371,5,"perfect lower cost alternative to big name brands, works just as well, so why pay more for others"
372,5,"Excellent product, excellent bang for the buck very easy to install."
373,5,Perfect
374,3,We like the covers but very hard to put in on a BMW Z4 with power seats.
375,3,"It's okay for the dashboard, and door panels; but don't use it on the speedometer plastic cover. This stuff is just good for the dash, door panels, but not on delicate plastics. It won't come off the speedo cover.<br /><br />Never, I repeat never spray this on the outside of your vehicle!!!! It won't come off the paint. I accidentally sprayed this stuff on the body paint (it was night time and I thought this was Windex). Just for interior use - of course. Not for glass, delicate plastics, or painted surfaces..."
376,5,I love it
377,5,Awesome product! Easy installation. Well worth the money!
378,5,"Had the gas cap stolen off my 1993 Toyota Camry.<br />Used this as a replacement.<br />Works fine, has been there for a few months now with no problems."
379,5,I Love it and the kids love it. Awesome customer to purchase from. Everything as described. Thanks.
380,5,It was for my nephew dirt bike. It s perfect.
381,5,"I haven't had to use this (thankfully), but the size is pretty convenient. It's small enough to keep in my room, which is nice in the winter when I'm using a little box heater."
382,5,Prefect in the 2014 Honda Accord. My wife loves them.
383,5,WONDERFUL ITEM.  MET ALL EXPECTATIONS.
384,5,This is a very nice impact hex drive set.  This was just what I needed for driving in and out set screws on large electrical wire connectors.  Match these up with a 1/2&#34; drive cordless impact driver and they work great.  I really like that each bit is made out of a single piece of metal.  I was using non-impact rated hex drivers previously and these make a world of difference.  The only downside (if you want to call it that) is that the bits aren't very long so if you have to reach something even modestly deep then you will be out of luck.
385,2,Even tough I was told this would 'fit my truck' it didn't. It was 13&#34; to narrow and had to be sent back. Wish they would put the dimensions in the article description and this would not have happened!
386,5,Lots of elbow grease was used to polish some brass on a LV bag. But it cleaned up nicely with a few dabs of Mr. Clean magic eraser.
387,5,good unit no problems
388,5,"So good, I recommend it"
389,5,canny
390,5,Fit perfectly - Would definitely recommend.
391,5,"Works perfectly, be sure to get your grounds right!"
392,5,"Fit great, easy install. Car is running better than ever now."
393,5,Fit and worked beautifully.  I put it on the car myself---a 63 year old woman. So anyone can probably do it.
394,5,"Wonderful product, fit perfectly, easy installation."
395,5,Awesome!
396,1,"Complete crap, a total waste.  I also didn't read the quantity was 1 instead of a set, so I WAAAAY overpaid for nothing.  This is unusable.  The clips at the bottom are uneven so there is more gap in front than back.  One of the nozzles was also embedded way the hell in the back of the head.  Don't waste your time on these.  Not worth it.  I would return it except it will cost me just as much as I might get back to do so.  This item is a complete racket with no QC involved whatsoever."
397,1,Does not work with 07 impala
398,4,"Not nearly as good as the Yuasa battery multi-tester, but it is only 1/4th the price."
399,2,Not what I thought I was getting.  I thought I was getting one that works with 220V and it doesn't.  Now it's on the other side of the ocean.  What battery tender can I get that works with 220V?  What can I do to make it work with 220V?
400,4,"I took a chance going for this car mount and I regret nothing.  It is very low-profile, with no big clips or arms extending out that you have to manipulate to get the phone on or off.  With the phone attached, you cannot even see the mount.<br /><br />I used it with a Galaxy S5 phone with an Otterbox case.  Had a bit of an issue with it at first, I used the rectangular metal piece between the case and phone (loose and no adhesive) and the phone had a tendency to slide around or tilt over with bumps or rough road; the phone never fell completely off the mount, just rotated and moved a bit.<br /><br />I figured out it was best to have the metal insert as close to the mount as possible; the case I use is quite thick and this was the cause of the slippage.  I switched to the smaller, adhesive backed mount on the inside of the case and have not had a problem since! The mount now holds VERY well and doesn't move.  So my advice is to use the smaller adhesive insert, secure it with the adhesive (I used clear tape instead) and enjoy it!<br /><br />All in all, a perfect low-impact mount that holds the phone securely! What more could you ask for?"
401,5,This tool will get the job done!
402,5,They are the only game in town for my Wheel Vintiques 15x8 Rallys.  They are very flimsy and a bit difficult to install.  On the flip side they will not come off very easily and they look really nice.
403,4,Fits a 2009 Honda Civic SI dome light.  Also fits 2008 Honda Accord.  Illumination could be a tad brighter.
404,5,"These were easy to install and look much better than the standard old bulbs. I hate ground issues, and as this was a tilt bed trailer, I ran a separate ground wire from the connector back to all of the lights."
405,4,They are great!
406,4,"This motorcycle jacket seems to be made of thinner (and a little lighter) leather, than the others i have from First Manufacturing. Having said that, it's still great!  I'll probably wear it during the warmer time of year. The zip-out lining is well made and suitable for cooler days or nights, in the late spring or early fall. Fit is true to size, for me. (I'm 120-125 lbs with a 34&#34; bust and 27&#34; waist and got an XS.) The braided trim adds to the styling without being too fussy and tge elastisized sides pull it in at the waist, giving it a more feminine shape."
407,4,"While the build quality wasn't the greatest and had to shave down some plastic to get it to fit, the final results looks good. Great value for the money."
408,1,I purchase rear lip for my Nissan maxima as stated in discription it's &#34;abs plastic not cheap fiberglass &#34; exact words I received lip with<br />Many flaw scratch scuffs on the lip the lip did no properly fit and was cracked abs plastic does not crack it would bend more freely I was sold fiberglass lip.
409,5,Wife loves the decal
410,5,"works as described, easy to program"
411,4,"It's a perfect replacement but required more paint prep than I'd hoped. Also masking the mirror was difficult, but for the price I shouldn't complain."
412,5,They were easy to install and work great
413,4,"Great sticker, I screwed up and got black and it doesnt show up on my dark tinted windows... just a reminder to others to not get black if they have tinted windows. Knocked one star off because when I purchased black was the only option."
414,5,Can see much better now.
415,5,Thank you've been receiving excellent order
416,2,"These fit the 2015 Camry fairly well.  The front fit is good but the back fit has to be forced somewhat.  My biggest disappointment was that these were advertised as new but when they arrived, they were significantly scuffed up, as if they had been used before.  I am considering returning them, depending on the price to do so.  Frustrating."
417,5,My other cable was fraying so I bought this one and its good to go now. It was also very easy to change!
418,5,This stuff works AMAZINGLY well.. Highly recommend it.
419,5,Great fit! Very happy with this product.
420,5,I love dem
421,1,"At first I loved the air filterm but after 5 months of using the filter, I now need a new head. The filter let small dirt particles into the engine causing the oil to become liquid sandpaper. Now I'm out 250 bucks from a 10$ filter. Buy a quality filter and spare future engine problems."
422,5,This is just what I needed works great
423,5,Great for protecting your ball and to keep grease off your clothing.
424,2,Took about a month. Said it was going to be there in less than a week. Quality is ok but not worth the time I waited
425,1,Wasted my money on this part.
426,5,Thanks!!
427,5,This is my choice with Mobil 1 being second.  They both are great for all three reservoirs on my Harley.
428,4,"great lights, small and work well"
429,5,THE ONLY PROBLEM was that the mounting brackets were not labeled correctly.
430,5,Excellent accurate worth every penny
431,5,Awesome Stuff
432,5,"This Vaccum pump sure isn't a Yellow Jacket but it will most definitely get the job done. Yes it may take a little longer, but for the price I can't complain. GREAT PRODUCT."
433,5,Excellent. I like the red light showing active charging and the green light showing the charge is completed. Float charge circuitry is a real bonus on this heavy duty unit. A great value.
434,5,Super fast shipping.  Item as described.
435,5,Lights up the night!  Love it.
436,5,Outstanding petcock!
437,4,I bought this for my trailer. It has 3 rows for cutlery. It's on the small and narrow side but perfect for my needs. It's not something I would buy for my home but serves its purpose well.
438,5,this was awesome and cheap works great!
439,5,Perfect!!!!!!
440,5,Great product
441,1,Great look but can't use factory hardware to mount had to glue them in which sucks
442,1,unfortunately this &iacute;tem did not fit mucho vehicle. It shows that it fits a BMW 323i 2000 but it didn't
443,5,Worked as designed
444,4,"Very nice magnet, expensive and slow shipping."
445,5,"I am definitely one of those people that yell at others while driving at night because all headlights make it to where I cannot see at night. It has gotten to the point that I practically refuse to drive at night unless I have to. My husband is always getting onto me about it! I got the opportunity to receive this product complimentary to review and could not wait to test it out! When I opened the box I was very happy with the way it was packaged. Not only was it in it's own box, but the shields themselves were covered in a protective film. You could tell that the film was needed too because the film was really scratched up, but when I took it off everything was perfect! It has a very large clip on it, which is nice because the product is decently heavy so I am glad they put a clip that will actually keep the product up when in use. The shields stay in place when driving and I love that now I can drive when I forget my sun glasses and also at night it protects me from the glares of headlights. If you have trouble seeing during either of these situations this product is perfect for you! You also don't have to wear anything extra on your face which I really like! I highly recommend this product!"
446,1,Was to flimsey to install!
447,5,"Bought two of these, one for my car and one for home.  Car smells fresher even though I smoke and same for the home.  Great product, would recommend for small areas!  Like that it's so easy and will save tons of money on those air fresheners that just mask odors!  Also like that you can use in a car and with the adapter, at home.  Genius!"
448,5,Works as intended.  All truck canopies should use these.
449,5,I liked that this separates the grit from the water.I used two bucket method and this really helped.
450,5,This sticker will make only attractive members of the opposite sex want to be your slave.  That or it's just a sticker?
451,5,These Brake drums make my baby run smoothly!
452,2,"I received it on time, but it's different from the picture. The la is white not blue as shown ."
453,1,Didnt receive the right item
454,5,How much easier does bleeding a coolant system get.
455,5,A GREAT PRODUCT.....excellent shine
456,5,"I ordered literally one day ago. It's already here. I put it in within about 10 minutes and my scooter runs again. It also feels like it starts easier and runs even faster than before! Built very well and cable is durable. Nice and snug. Lil boost on acceleration. Work good and also a good price. Product was nicely packaged and felt of pretty good quality for the price. They included their business card with phone number where a real person answered.. A+++++My scooter was not running before due to the ignition coil shaking lose and breaking in cold weather.Very much worth the price! Wouldn’t believe the improved performance if i didn’t experience it myself ....even arrived early perfect!! Works perfect, Fits spot on, perfect generic part for generic QMB139 engine. More power and is easier to start. better throttle response, no lag! Easy setup, fast shipping! Works much better than my old one."
457,2,"I have NO IDEA why this product has so many good reviews!  Not to bash other customers, but they must have never used a real compressor / inflator before.  Not only is this little thing DEAD SLOW, but it doesn't even have an auto shut-off switch!  So unless you are really searching for something you can almost fit in your glove box for a 2am emergency, I would completely avoid this overpriced and overrated piece of junk.  Because if you ever get a flat tire, I hope you have 45 minutes to kill while sitting and staring at it to make sure your tire doesn't explode.<br /><br />For less money, I would highly recommend the Black & Decker ASI500 12-Volt Cordless Air Station Inflator.  (http://www.amazon.com/Black-Decker-ASI500-Cordless-Inflator/dp/B002MUAUJM/)  Or for $10 LESS, I would also recommend the Black & Decker ASI300 Air Station 12-Volt or 120-Volt Inflator.  (http://www.amazon.com/Black-Decker-ASI300-120-Volt-Inflator/dp/B000IE0YIQ/)<br /><br />UPDATE: Jack over at Kensun contacted me right after I posted this review, and rectified my disappointing purchase by replacing the pump with their best one.  (http://www.amazon.com/Kensun-Home-Portable-Compressor-Inflator/dp/B00L3FKPYW/?ref_=pe_823600_114105210)  So if you are thinking of buying this, I would DEFINITELY spend the extra $10 and just get that one."
458,5,Just what every one who has tires needs from time to time.
459,5,worked great
460,5,Great fit and finish.
461,5,FAST SHIP AND IT WAS FREE SHIP ITM GRATE FIT THANK YOU
462,2,IV'E HAD BETTER REPAIR KITS. THIS WAS A WASTE OF $$$$
463,4,"Nice item - shame it's in black though as opposed to the OEM silver.  Painting it would apparently void the warranty on it as it has a warranty sticker and &#34;DEA&#34; markings on it.  Works well, installs quickly without fuss or modification"
464,5,"No I do not work for them. I bought the tiny bottle for 20.00 at Alco &#34;As seen on TV&#34; stand and thought I'd try it. I cleaned the faded seat and saddlebags on my Harley and applied &#34;wipe new&#34; to them. The look showroom new and so far seems to be holding up. Only been two weeks so far, but looking good. From what I have been able to gather, people DONT prep the surface they are going to use it on and then get pissed at the results. Will know more about the products lasting effects and if it changes I'll post again."
465,5,"Heavy duty, would defiantly recommend. Make getting into the bed much easier."
466,5,Product came exactly as pictured. Looks great on the car :)
467,4,Worked fine so far
468,4,"Fit and finish is fine, but like any other black anodized product, it started looking purple after a few months in the sun."
469,5,The perfect fit for my Raider. It does not take away from the unique Raider appearance.
470,3,Mounting brackets are garbage
471,5,Very happy with the quality. Sturdy metal and design isn't just a decal. The design is pressed in to the metal and then painted.
472,5,Great
473,5,"I ordered on online where I used to buy these at NAPA or Sears. It used to be you could go into an auto parts store and get one of these with no problem. Now the guy/gal behind the counter looks at you like you're asking for a special tool for fixing an alien spacecraft - not a tire iron. Anyhow, it's a tire iron and it is used to lift the tire bead off the rim - okay? I does exactly that. What more can I say."
474,4,great deal
475,4,VERY GOOD ITEM
476,5,Arrived on time and plugged right in!
477,5,"exactly what I wanted. Great quality. Easily cut to size. I was able to do three doors on my Ram, the driver door was done at the factory and these match perfectly  I had enough left over to do both doors on my Challenger plus do around the bottom corners of the doors because of how low it sits sometimes I have to move away from the curb or I scrape on the curb.  All my door edge problems have been solved. I ordered two packs and I have a full strip and a half left over if I need them."
478,5,"Great product, do the job im happy.."
479,5,Perfect oem replacement for my car.
480,5,"Strange looking at it in a different language, but easy enough to use that even I don't need to read the directions.(even though hubby thought he had to explain it)  Love that I get other tips to inflate other things.  Nice and fast."
481,1,too small.
482,5,Came on time fit perfectly good price.
483,5,good battery good price
484,5,"Tried it out as soon as I got it.  Seems to be very well constructed, fuel flowed fast from one container to another.  Very easy to get started and kept working until all the fuel was drained.  Couldn't have been happier."
485,5,"These Mini Blade fuses are perfect to have incase you do something stupid and blow one.  It is a great selection of the most commonly used fuses, complete with a handy fuse tester, and at a great price compared to a trip to the local auto parts store."
486,3,Eh... Not nearly as good as advertised does not clean or keep clean like expected.
487,5,"Bright. Works Great.  I ordered one, tried it and ordered two more.  I'll probably order a fourth at some point.<br /><br />The only issue is the allen screws are a bit hard to get started as the hex nut is very small and needs to be shoved in just right.<br /><br />With that one minor complaint.  I have to say these are great lamps.  I saw something similar selling at West marine for about $150. Crazy price.<br /><br />These are fairly priced and you can buy a few while your at it."
488,5,"Fast service , fast install , this took a few minutes to install and it works great , the one that I replaced had a melted display screen . I would recommend this purchase ,..way less expensive than dealer ."
489,5,"fast delivery, product as described, can't beat the price!!!"
490,5,"Great, everything I expected. Great color, easy install..."
491,5,Perfect!
492,5,good part for f150 xlt with 4.6 v8.  good install for fair price.
493,4,"Walker 35512 fits a MINIMUM diameter of 2&#34; if it is tightened down all the way. It works, but it is not  particular good fit between a 2-inch exhaust pipe and a &#34;2-inch&#34; cap. It's not a big deal, but it's a bummer to spend of bunch of time finding the &#34;right&#34; parts to find out they are not right. Product needs accurate description."
494,3,"Second set of &#34;smoked&#34; lenses iv bought for my truck. First set were what i wanted style wise, smoked lenses with clear reflectors, but the lowers started gettin moister like most all these styles do. Then the chrome and tint started fallin off the inside after about 2 yrs, not bad for a set of 100 upper and lowers. Since the uppers were still good i bought these lowers looking like they'll match from the picture even though it states amber reflectors. I went ahead and took a chance. They are amber reflectors. And they are plain as day, like picture makes them look dark. So i just taped off from the amber part over and VHT'd them dark enough so you cant see the amber and it looks alright. I also took some clear &#34;shower&#34; silicone, &#34;shower&#34; because its more &#34;permanent&#34;, and went around the whole lense, between the housing and lense, and put a little electrical grease around the sockets for the bulbs just to try to keep any moister out of them. If they stay clear and un fogged for a yr or two ill be happy for the price. And only place iv seen only lowers for a reasonable price for the 03-07.5 silverados."
495,5,Installed easily and works perfectly.
496,5,as good as the O E product
497,5,"Quality piece.  I've had another Yoshimura, and a full LeoVince.  I like this a lot, and the price here was the best I could finde. Thank you."
498,2,When it works is perfect. Used for break tail light with 2 level of light (more brightness when you press the pedal). But it start blinking when I press the pedal in less than 5 months. Too expensive for only 5 months of use!! Very disappointed.
499,1,"Very cheap, the way it's shown in the picture I assumed it would just be the white letter which is what I wanted. But it's on a black background. Don't buy"
500,4,Works as Described.
501,5,Great product. Needed in a rush and Amazon came through.
502,5,These plugs worked
503,5,works great!
504,1,need to buy new one after 2 weeks of use
505,2,"Its pretty much garbage. The Headgear was nice, but the faceshield was filmy on the outer side, making it hard to see, and covered in scratches, the protective film was in a wad in the box, and only the headgear was shipped in a protective bag. I'll keep the headgear, but I fear the face protector is going to have to be tossed."
506,5,"Nice! Bought for the valve caps, which were of surprising weight and quality. Will see how they hold up over time, but NICE upon arrival. Bonus keyring....average, but nice for casual use of &#34;occasional&#34; keys. not sure I'd trust it with important keys regularly. Overall a very nice purchase. Delivered in reasonable time."
507,1,Plastic!! That's what you get for 40.00 bucks
508,5,WORK GREAT
509,5,Genuine Subaru quality. Nice mats that give the car a little more character than the stock carpet mats.
510,5,Works just as well as the original. The instructions were included and were right on the money.
511,2,"Product support horrible! I've bought OTC snap-ring pliers that broke and were not supported by OTC 24 hours after warranty expired.<br /><br />OTC is Bosch Automotive Aftermarket, Automotive Service Solutions"
512,5,Perfect for greasing my pressure washer.
513,3,"The Cargo shade fit perfectly, but was torn and scratched in a couple places very obvious"
514,4,Works great. No issues.
515,5,"I've been using my Stinky Cigar Car Ashtray for almost a year now, and this thing is awesome!  For the Cigar smoker on the go, this ash tray holds your cigar securely so it doesn't bounce out onto the floor of your truck and start a fire with all of those fast food wrappers and oily rags you've been meaning to toss into your neighbor's yard.  I like it better than the &#34;bobken&#34; style because it actually holds your cigar in place, is gentle enough that it doesn't damage the wrapper, and the lid can be closed to keep ashes from blowing around your '82 Ford Escort hatchback with your windows cranked down because your A/C hasn't worked since the first Bush was President.  Stinky's website recommends putting a splash of water in the bottom to keep ashes from blowing around if you like to drive with the windows down, but I found it unnecessary.  I put one of those colored &#34;cause of the week&#34; bracelets (mine was a save the slug beetles bracelet or something like that) around mine to keep it snug in my cup holder, but a beer koozie would work just fine if your cup holders are Mega Big Gulp sized.  This is a high quality ashtray.  The finish is excellent and the lid is a snug fit when closed.  I highly recommend."
516,5,"OEM Product, I love the fact its all weather, first day i got them I spilled coffee on them and boy was I glad I had them in the car."
517,3,"Made great foam, smells great ! But it didnt clean all that well. Where i live there is salt and it left alot of risiduel dirt behind. As a test after washing and rinsing I let it drip dry cause my truck is black and want to see how cleaned it  before wiping. I could see where the sprayer had been and alot of left over debris  in the paint"
518,4,"It didn't work for our truck, but we have no complaints with the service we received. I would recommend them highly."
519,3,the chrome coating is not that great
520,5,Excellet
521,5,"These are very good quality. They fit beautifully,  and they look badass!"
522,5,ok
523,5,"Compact, quiet, fast."
524,5,Very Good Very Good
525,5,Worked great
526,3,It works.  This is the second plate I've purchased.
527,5,Perfect as Described !!!!!
528,5,Came faster thaN expected very easy to install. Everything came with it.
529,5,"This mount works great. It provides a nice, neat way to add electrical connectors for trailers wiring without having to screw a mounting bracket into your bumper. I love the fact that I don't have messy wires hanging down from the hitch anymore. Overall it took about 30 minutes to install because I had to wire for the 7-pin connector. The mounting bracket itself went on in about 5 minutes. The two bolts keep it locked on the 2&#34; receiver and unable to fall off. The only thing I didn't like so much, is that you need to tighten the bolts to such an extent that the bolts and the top and bottom of the mount actually bend and conform to the receiver, this is how you get a snug fit so it doesn't move around. The metal surface of the mount actually bows out a bit. Not really a big deal, and it has no impact on the function of the mount, purely aesthetic. I partnered this mount with the &#34;Hopkins 47185 Multi-Tow Adapter&#34;. I chose this adapter due to built-in 4 flat connector. The two fit together perfectly, no problems. Overall I love this mount and definitely recommend it!"
530,5,Perfect height leveling kit easy install.
531,5,"Perfect fit, and high quality, as always with Mann filters"
532,4,good replacement part
533,5,"It works better then I expected in my Honda Pioneer 700. I did use clear silicone on any part where I thought moisture might  get in. I have bought 2 smaller led lights for the back of the machine. I want to add more , it's kinda addicting.  I have been recommending the light to all of my friends. Even if you think you have good enough stock lights on your machine, add a light bar to it and you will never want to be without one."
534,4,"We bought this for a cross country trip. They are heavy duty and durable and performed exactly as expected.  I will say, though, that this was not easy to put together, hence the four stars instead of 5.  I would not want to attempt the assembly again!"
535,4,Good
536,5,great fit for my Triumph.  I feel safer with the self cancelling feature
537,1,Junk
538,5,"These lights work great with my car,  I drive a 2006 Honda Accord coupe  , I recommend this product to others"
539,5,Worked great! Shipped fast!
540,5,perfect fit
541,5,I always use Gates products.
542,4,"Mine arrived with a few chips in the paint or powder coat. I kept it because it because I knew it would get a few more and I was right as trailer tongues have taken more off. I have towed a 10k pound trailer with it so far as well as some smaller loads. I have no concerns about the strength of it, but the coating could be better."
543,5,"Since it's made for the A3, it fit the cargo area in my Audi perfectly, with total protection. I feel much better putting anything back there now. Great product!"
544,3,They look cheap. Would have been OK for about $5.  Not worth $14
545,4,"Dose not quite fit that exact, but dose sound great! All that is needed is to be welded."
546,5,it fit perfect onto the car. installation not too hard
547,5,I'm not sure why I waited this long to purchase the PCV. I installed a Two Brothers exhaust on my 2012 Ninja 650 almost 2 riding seasons ago. Immediately after installing the exhaust I noticed that I lost some low end power and gained some high end as well as dropping some weight. The power band had a few flat spots in it as well (they were there in stock format as well just not as pronounced). After the install of the PCV all the flat spots are now gone. The low end power I had lost is now back with a vengeance and all the high end I've come to love is still there and then some. Basically the big pulls a lot harder from the moment you touch the throttle all the way to red line. I actually accidentally popped a wheelie at a red light because I was so used to taking off at higher RPM's which is no longer needed.  Definitely worth every cent. Now I need to schedule time to get it dyno'ed so I can get even more potential out of it.
548,2,"This was difficult to match with the OEM faucet in our Newmar motorhome. OEM was heavy cast bronze for the water header, plated metal for the surround. The Dura is something Id expect to find  in a stick and tin trailer. It is all plastic including the surround. Looks similar, but not the same. I'm keeping the old one and replacing the washers inside."
549,4,Good Product
550,5,Very effective. Used on propellor spinner usually stubborn to get spots off. The grime totally came off in one easy application. Polishing rag was filthy but that's okay. Shine was like new.
551,5,good product remove scares
552,5,"Great lights, easy to install and they are a huge different from the light that came with the car. most pleasant lighting. Highly recommend them"
553,2,Cheep ass garbage.<br />Yes they are what they say. But the quality is very poor<br />They are not all uniform. There not tight at all. They don't expand enough to hold the plastic panels togther. And some just fall straight out.<br />Yes I bought the correct size. I pulled the size from the dealer.
554,4,"Pretty bright for the price. For those of you buying this, I would wrap electrical tape around the part where you plug the red and black individual wires into the plug for additional protection. Instructions didn't make sense or I didn't have the patience to read them so I watched a video review on YouTube which I highly recommend doing before installing the product."
555,3,"Bought this to replace the VALUJUNK  and DURATRASH from AUTOZONE , seems that all their  junky suspension parts start failing just a year later , just enagh time for the warranty to expire . I spend good amount of labor , money on suspension parts , new tires and aliment  . now a year latter my tires are starting to wear univen  as  ball joints are failing.  At least that is my experience with AUTOZONE .  Spend a few dlls more , getting better cuality parts ,  so you dont  have to spend much more later"
556,2,"Pretty flimbsy, broke one trying to pry out a pushin fastener on Dodge 3500 fender well."
557,5,A++++
558,5,Worked great. Fit great. Perfect
559,4,The center line hitch worked perfectly and as expected. Set up was easy and the instructions were very good. The only problem that I encountered was that the spring bars that I received did not fit correctly. They were to wide to fit in the brackets mounted on the trailer. I had to grind a significant amount of metal to get them to fit correctly. I did not have the time to send them back.
560,5,Unusually good wipers for the price...is it weird to love wiper blades so much?
561,5,Great fit in my 2015 Ram 1500 and were received promptly
562,5,"FIT IT DIRCTLY ON MY 2008 XTERRA , GOOD PRICE , HIGH QUALITY , I WILL BUY THEM AGAIN SOON .<br />THANK YOU SO MUCH"
563,2,"The orientation of the plug on the cable leaves the cable sitting against a knob, making it hard to turn the knob."
564,5,It does its job
565,1,Didn't receive the correct product
566,4,Wind blows it away.. Sometimes.  But good for this price.
567,5,Works perfectly. Two screws and a plug in.... easy.
568,5,Incredibly easy to install and the sound is perfect not so loud it's annoying but a beautiful deep rumble. Could instantly feel the lower end torque difference without question. The only thing I was concerned about was the back 2 hanger rods don't have the hanger tips and thought the rods may slip out of the hangars but they do stay in place. The Stainless option was actually almost 100$ cheaper here than anywhere else I checked. The side pipes did come slightly crooked out of the box but with a lil pry bar persuasion it worked out great!
569,1,Bulbs lasted less than one month.
570,5,tires do not wear on inside now
571,3,"Easy to install, decent value"
572,5,2012 Cruze ECO. No problem on installation. Good clean product.
573,5,Product did not solve my application. My bad.
574,5,Good to go
575,5,great charging results
576,5,Good
577,5,Excellent
578,4,"It took about 1 hr to install the rails on my 2013 Wrangler.<br />like others have noted the passenger and driver side rails were mislabeled.<br />The passenger side rail installed with no problem in about 15 minutes. However, the driver side rail was another story.<br />Both mounting tabs were bent upward so it was impossible to get the bolts to line up with the holes in the pinch weld. Fortunately I was able to put the rail in a vice and pound the tables back into position.<br />The next problem I ran into was I had to enlarge one of the pinch weld holes, then trail went on with no problem.<br />The rail with the bent mount taps did not appear to be damaged in any way, and the shipping carton was in excellent<br />shape. I attribute the bent mounting tabs to sloppy manufacturing.<br />All said, they do look good, and I am pleased with them."
579,5,Boxes are great. They have a lot of room in them for tools. Have two of them on my truck.
580,5,"Seemed nice, Was shipped out by accident."
581,5,Used in my meth injection kit. Works great. Great price.
582,5,It's a wonderful pice of card board that fit perfectly and kept the antifreeze from leaking out of my thermostat housing. Great job start you got it right.
583,2,I bought this item at walmart. VERY DISAPPOINTED because I try to plug 3 things into it and the weakling fuse blows.  Don't buy this if you are trying to run an oxygen machine for sure.
584,5,It's not extremely big yet visible enough for people to see
585,5,Vary nice helmet
586,5,"Good price, fast shipping."
587,4,"Haven't had opportunity to use it yet, have it stored in my truck.  living in a 3rd world country you need to be prepared.  T rust this unit and feel it will perform as stated."
588,5,Great product gave a nice look to the blinker lights on my classic project!
589,5,I really like the idea. easy installed looks great. I have got a lot of good comment after installing this on my jeep.
590,2,Just okay.  the other ones I've had are more comfortable.  This one is good for either sitting or completely lounging.  There is really no in between.
591,5,"[[VIDEOID:b145805c6f8c0387299025a3fb3c7843]] Power Inverters are very useful for all kinds of emergency situations such as when the grid goes down, for camping, when your vehicle stalls depending on the reason it stalls or extreme weather. You can connect this one of two ways - simply plug it into your cigarette lighter or hook it directly to your vehicles battery the same way you would jumper cables.<br />There is one UB port and a fully grounded AC outlet, so you can prevent shortages from happening that could damage whatever you have plugged in to the power inverter. There is also a loud alarm that will get your attention once your battery reaches 10 1/2 volts. This means you need to shut everything down. If you do not shut things down on your own, it will automatically shut itself down once your battery reaches 10 volts so it does not do irreparable damage to your vehicles battery.<br />The way the X-Shade 1300 Watt power inverter work is it takes the direct current (DC) power of a car or truck and turns it into the alternating current(AC) needed by everyday appliances. Best of all it is fully portable and does not need to be mounted to use it. It is pretty lightweight as well so carrying it in a bug out bag or a backpack would be possible. You could keep one in each vehicle too. Just make sure to keep it dry.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this item for free or at a reduced price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. All opinions are my own."
592,4,one of the bulbs had a clear spot on it so it doesn't look red.  I can't use it for a brake light.  I would appreciate if you'd send me another one to replace it.  Thank you.
593,4,Very good
594,5,"The running boards are great, easy to install, took about 10 minutes to put on and fit perfectly."
595,1,This is NOT a kit. This is an Optronics light SET. It only includes the tailights even though the wire harness is shown.<br />You can get a better deal from other sellers.
596,4,Good
597,5,"Product was exactly as ordered.  Fast and easy shipping. Excellent packaging.  Awesome looking seat, built to last and comfortable. Big upgrade from my stock seat."
598,5,Works as advertised....
599,4,works well. Is as described
600,5,Fit was exact. Seemed to be good quality.
601,4,Everything you need to rebuild the top end. Dont forget these forged metal pistons you have to drill 2 holes in the piston where the exhaust bridge is. Instructions on how to do so included.
602,5,Awesome
603,4,"Well... the part came in a &#34;black magic&#34; tire shine box, then inside was another box with the pump in it. The pump installed easily,  and has no issues working. I just thought it was strange it was in another company's box, but other than that the part has worked perfectly."
604,5,Fit is near perfect and it has made my life so much easier when doing oil changes on my 2009 BMW 335i.<br /><br />Don;t waste your time with other types on wrenches. Get this.
605,5,Makes my bike look great!
606,5,catches all the dirt pebbles etc. great product!
607,1,"Unlike the original wiper blades, these refills do not have an embedded metal strip for support. As a result, they fit very loosely in the blade and flap back and forth when the wipers are on, failing to make contact with large sections of the windshield. The rubber refills don't seem to fit surely in the blade and would be likely to fling off when you need them the most (during a heavy rain with the wipers on high)."
608,5,It's great that it evens out the surfaces from paint to decoupage.
609,5,"Easy to replace, and fits perfectly. Exactly the same as the one I took off."
610,5,Love all BooYah products!
611,5,fits and much more solid than stock
612,5,Prompt delivery. Very easy install. It looks great and is a great addition to my jeep rebuild!
613,5,Worked perfectly on my 2005 Chevy Colorado
614,5,I just realized that I bought this in '12! I still have some and I like it very much. I have a Weber with lots of stainless steel and this stuff just works! Spray and wipe with paper towel or cloth and the grease and spatters are gone. I guess the fact that I still have some proves that it don't take much to get 'er clean. I grille all year round too.
615,5,NEEDED IT FOR MY 5.0L OVERHAUL.  GOOD TOOL AND A FAIR PRICE.
616,5,Fit is perfect. Good quality.
617,2,"Definitely not an OEM part. I don't believe it was sold as that. However the tank did not fit my 07 X3 that I bought it for. I even took the extra step to contact the company prior to ordering to make sure that it did in fact fit my car. Was mad it didn't work. Their is a reason a OEM tank is over a hundred at the dealership and this is half the price, and its not profit margin its quality...."
618,5,The tip is so MAAAD
619,5,Direct OEM replacement TPMSs for your GM car or truck...would definitely recommend...<br /><br />Call dealer to get part number to make sure you are purchasing the correct ones....
620,5,It fits perfect
621,1,"In the box, this antenna looks good and appears to of high quality. It doesn't come with sleeves to make it match up with the Miata base. Then the real disappointment comes! In my area there is probably 20 to 30 stations that are listenable. Even the closest and strongest stations now have static. Do yourself a favor and save your money!"
622,5,I should have researched this more as I was looking for a high temp lube for the oven racks in<br />my Electrolux oven with the ball bearing tracks.It works better than peanut oil but smokes at over 450 F.
623,1,Not happy at all. Will be contacting manufacturer. Clip holding muting bracket fell off first day I had them installed and some lights do not work through the wiring. Bulbs are fine. Not satisfied what so ever.
624,5,"Great deal, nice wire, insul and ends."
625,4,"like my previous bag, but less quality"
626,5,Easy to install and work great!  Fit my 2001 Navigator perfectly.
627,3,Didn't come with nuts for the provided screws. Does not fit the Tow Ready 118450 T-Connector Enclave well. I had to jury rig it a bit.
628,4,Easy to install and looks nice on 15 wrx.<br />only con is pricey..
629,5,Awesome!
630,4,Very good.
631,5,Does the job...
632,5,Received this item quick. They are an EXACT replacement for my OEM parts. Took the old ones off and these fit like a glove. Couldn't be happier.
633,5,Good product
634,4,I've used this for a few washes now and it's held up great. It's my first synthetic chamois and works just well as the natural ones I've had in the past.
635,5,Perfect
636,5,Thanks my item es very good and cheap
637,5,"Was a perfect fit on my 2007 Tacoma, no brainer to replace. I just bought one to replace my original assembly, which had a crack at the top. It included all the light bulbs necessary, and all the connectors worked as expected. Color and lens are almost exactly the same as OEM, perhaps this is slightly brighter because it's newer. Very satisfied with it, and good price for it."
638,5,Gracias.
639,4,"Battery was listed as new, but had no packaging to support that. The battery does work and seems to hold a charge though."
640,5,"Nice kit, well made, and gives a nice lift.<br /><br />It does interfere with the tailpipe but you can modify the hanger a few inches over to clear it. Also, install the bolt head on the tailpipe side to give more clearance."
641,5,good looking enhances my car looks good
642,4,"I recently ordered and installed the Kuryakyn Panacea on my 2006 Sportster XL 1200R.  It looks great and is far better than the RED stock light that sticks out a few inches off the fender.  With the laydown license frame the rear end of the bike looks far better.<br /><br />I was surprised to find that I needed to order a 6 to 8 pin adapter in order to install the control unit under the seat.  That's a bummer to have to wait a couple days after installing the light.  I was pumped to go for a ride... but without the control unit installed, the light only works as a running light.  The brake light will not work.<br /><br />The install is VERY easy.  To install the controller  you remove the seat and you can access the electrical directly underneath.  I removed the two screws holding down a wiring harness under the seat to gain access to the wiring for the back of the bike.  It's all plug and play once you get the correct connectors.  In my case the 6 to 8 pin harness mentioned above.  Overall, it probably takes 10-15 minutes max with nothing but a Philips screwdriver."
643,5,Ordered for a friend's motor cycle used fur racing.  He is happy with the purchase
644,5,I love it. Going to order another one like it.
645,5,"My little FSM arrived safe and sound, and it wasn't any problem installing him on the back of my car (after cleaning the space first). So far so good, after several washes, some snow storms and plenty of rain, no sign of wear or fading."
646,5,Love this fuel rail!
647,4,We bought this for our travel trailer bed - we used it as a base and put the cheap rv mattress on top of it since it is bigger than the small 'queen' of the RV world.  It worked wonders - made sleeping very comfortable!  And you can't beat the price.  Shipment was fine too...
648,5,Excellent quality and price.  Fast shipping
649,5,Great grips~
650,5,As described.  Nice replacement.
651,3,Stopping is good.  Mine never stopped making noise after the break in period.  Yes I followed the directions.  Messy too.  Leaves more brake dust on wheels and body than oem pads.
652,5,Works great on my GMC SIERRA DENNALI !!! IT LOOKS GREAT TOO !!!
653,5,Does what it's meant to & is quality built
654,4,there are no instructions on modifications.so far no blue illumination trying to figure that out
655,4,"One thing to watch out for is, if you have pretty much any slightly larger modern day phone, the phone slot will be too small. Other than that it's very nice and sticks to your tank very securely."
656,3,good deal
657,4,great
658,5,Been wearing t h is skid lid for over five years and is the most comfortable but not legal so I just put a harley sticker on the back
659,5,Ordered 2 of these to replace the timing belts on my 1998 Honda Valkyrie Tourer motorcycle.  Perfect fit and good quality.
660,3,"The bracket itself is actually made fairly well, however there is no hardware to attach the license plate with. I am not referring to the couple of screws that attach the bracket to the RV or trailer, as that hardware is not normally included.<br /><br />There is a square channel for this bracket that typically uses a square nut (hopefully stainless). If the bracket is used flush against the backwall of a RV, then you cannot get a wrench behind the bracket - so the general idea is to use a square nut, as it will be held captive as you screw on the license plate.<br /><br />While you can buy a square nut at many hardware stores, it will likely be zinc plated rather than stainless, so they will be prone to rust. Most auto stores no longer carry the square nut type license plate hardware, so if you want stainless, you may need to find a specialty marina that has a good hardware selection.<br /><br />Other brackets of this type I have previously purchased had the square nut hardware, but for some reason this one did not. Perhaps because these are OEM packaged rather than retail.<br /><br />Still, the build quality of this holder is fairly good, and a little ingenuity will provide a source for the square nuts."
661,5,"No trips yet, but drives nice on tow mode & speedo reset for 33&#34; tires."
662,5,Fits the shoulder harness well
663,5,"This filter was perfect fit for my 2012 Nissan Sentra,  made with good materials, great price, highly Recommended"
664,4,"These seem to be well made LED headlamps.  While they fit my 2006 MDX headlight sockets, they did not work properly.  The issue here is the fact that the LED headlamp only has an LED on one side.  Due to the shape of the reflector / projector lens in my old halogen lights, the single LED only cast it light upwards.  This is not a fault of the LED headlights (hence my four star rating) but rather the design of the projector lens used by Acura.  UPDATE (raised to 4 stars): I ended up returning these and replacing them with a  set with the LED on both sides to better utilize my lights.  Even the style with LEDs on both sides left a dark area in front of my MDX.  This confirms my suspicion that the projector lens in my MDX requires light coming in a 360 ring around the bulb.  Replacing this second et of LED headlights with expensive Sylvania H11 bulbs solved the problem.  Now my only problem is paying $50 for a replacement set of bulbs when these go out (whiter halogen bulbs burn brighter/hotter and have a shorter life span).  These would be great if you have a reflector or different projector setup ."
665,5,"Perfect, exactly what I expected ..."
666,5,Good quality and fit perfectly
667,1,This was very cute but it will not stay on the seats.
668,5,fits & looks perfect
669,3,Pretty loose on tires. Tend to blow off
670,2,Not the same size as original. Too loose in socket. one won't stay on. Won't buy this brand again
671,1,Really didnt use it. It was not what I needed.
672,5,Wonderful product!
673,4,worked fine
674,5,no more rust
675,1,no comment
676,1,DOA.<br />Not good. I have learned my lesson going cheap on these parts. Best to buy OEM.<br />Strongly recommend to not buy this.
677,5,"Obviously, I didn't check the tank but when we released our black water it seemed to flow smoothly from the RV. This product was highly recommended at the RV store!"
678,5,very good price and good brand name !
679,5,Love it!
680,5,"This fan keeps my gal from plowing into a tree due to no defrost in her car.  she can clear her windows very quickly before setting off and clip it to her opened glove box to keep her windows clear as she motors on!<br /><br />Its powerful, and noisy, but hey, it gets the job down for a good price and is durable!  Watch your long hair though folks, this did result in a hilarious emergency haircut need once though..."
681,3,"I purchase Mequiars products for my car all the time ,these wipes are just ok,  the High gloss wipes are much better"
682,5,Item arrived quickly. A good factory spec replacement cabin filter for my subaru forrestor
683,5,Great product ! THANKS
684,5,I didn't use the wiring harness ......thanks for the spare bulbs.
685,5,Love this item..it wouldn't fit over my front plat but it fits the back one.
686,2,"It looks good...but no directions what so ever, and the screws are very cheap and stripped  when trying to tighten them. I would recommend going to Home Depot and buying good replacement screws."
687,1,Only wipes for about 1/2 of the length of the wiper blade.  Very disappointed.
688,5,Just what I needed to keep my hibernating Boxster fresh.
689,5,Great value for the price
690,5,Works well for my ktm
691,5,This plug is like a shot of adrenaline for my rebuilt 1.8 ltr MGB engine.
692,5,very nice
693,5,awesome stuff. this is a blessing in disguise. 10 mins of work and car is clean with great shine. make sure the car is not very dirty before using. need two microfiber towel to wipe it clean. i put in a little bit of water when adding to the spray bottle so that it lasts long.
694,4,I bought this for a friend (as is how you are supposed to receive them). The pictures really don't do them justice. I was surprised at how nice it really is.
695,5,"Fit perfectly and worked as expected. Put these in several months ago, and still no leaks, no issues."
696,5,Thought they were HID before I bought them so I was slightly dissapointed when they arrived. Still VERY BRIGHT and I love it. Great lights i would reccomend.
697,5,"Used them on my 2003 H2 Hummer, all 7 of the gauges use the same actuator. Being able to replace these instead of buying a new cluster saved me hundreds."
698,3,Nice product but got the wrong ones i ordered blue and got black
699,5,Followed the instructions and it worked perfectly
700,5,"The packaging is terrible, but that aside, this was a great buy. Far cheaper than buying from Curt or other retailers. The included hitch is too short for me, but for the extra $3 or so you also get the hitch pin.<br />Install was straight forward. Directions were great. I completed it in less than 2 hours."
701,5,"Love it, worked perfectly in my 1971 Jaguar xj6."
702,1,This item did not work for charging my car battery.
703,5,"Love this deal and the product,"
704,5,Nice item
705,4,The Gold Color really stands out Thanks!
706,3,They worked fine
707,5,A great fit.  Just what I was looking for.
708,5,Love the way they look on my truck. Awesome!
709,5,This replaceable lens is everything I wanted with the gm67 helmet.  It seals all the way around when you  use the jaw set accessory.  I tried multiple times to get it to fog up and it won't.  This lens is more durable than the stock lens.  With out the jaw set (makes the helmet a full face instead of an open face and it's removable) the lens was made to protect a little lower so less air and dust in your face from the chin area.
710,5,Fit perfectly !! Easy install great price too
711,1,These things are absolute junk. I threw them away and bought factory replacements from Ford.
712,5,"Fantastic. Worked great, easy install"
713,5,"Shinny,,,"
714,2,wrong fit
715,3,Switch works well.  It is nice that the &#34;on&#34; indicator light doesn't require a separate wire.  The bulbs are not externally replaceable like most of these style switches are.  It isn't OEM quality.
716,5,GOOD FOR 2ND HELMET AND THEE XL GOOD FOR A WOMAN'S HEAD AND ALL THERE HAIR
717,5,PERFECT
718,5,"Received hitch, directions, bumper insert, electronics and all hardware necessary.  Install took me about 1.5 hours (working alone) and most of that was working slower than usual to be sure not to scratch or ding my new vehicle.  This is the factory OEM equipment, and was delivered quickly from an Acura dealership at a much lower cost than the local/published prices from Acura."
719,5,Great product. Fits perfectly on my 2013 Ford fusion
720,4,kept my snow blower cab window clear
721,5,wife loves it.
722,5,I bought it for ny dad and he said he wished he would have bought it years ago!
723,4,"Great Quality Mats, just wish there were holes for the clips in the car"
724,4,"Pretty hard to install but is good to have it in you car,  fit and work good in the corolla 2005.  just learn how to install it yourself in YuoTube!"
725,5,Thought my 3 year old Makita compressor was dead after it stopped working this late fall here outside in Minnesota. It didn't even trip a fuse just stopped. Brought the compressor into my basement to warm it up and tear it apart. I found a motor reset button hiding under the cover and after resetting it the compressor started working just fine.<br />Read my manual and review and I was long over due for a oil change. Switch to Royal Purple synthetic and now it runs better outside in our cold days where it use to blow fuses or not run at all.
726,3,not totaly fit in some places.
727,2,"I enjoy the overall shape and design, however, the design team could work on their installation adapters. There is a lower metal sleeve that went on cross threaded (or was never properly threaded), and I had to end up super gluing it to get it to work.<br /><br />I would not buy this again."
728,5,"My 05 Focus ZX4 was having an issue when accelerating.  It would stutter like it was going to die and the check engine light was on.  I bought this at half the price the local auto stores were charging and works perfect.  Easy replacement, no more stutter and no more check engine light."
729,1,Not the same color as advertised.
730,5,fit and worked OK
731,2,"This vendor practices fraud.  These are NOT Bussmann fuses.  If you look at the photo on the Amazon website carefully, you can see the letters &#34;BUSS&#34; and &#34;ATC&#34; stamped on the top of the fuse -- as genuine Bussmann fuses do -- but this product is not so labelled.  The type of plastic the photo shows (typical of Bussmann fuses) is also incorrect.  Finally, the description says that the product comes with &#34;a re-sealable clamshell package&#34;.  This is also false."
732,5,"Does the job, reasonably priced"
733,5,"Nice helmet, fit good and look great."
734,2,"Ripped when I was installing. That's my fault, but the product could have been sewn better to prevent that."
735,5,Typical Honda high quality.  No rubber smell which is good.  I layed them on the garage floor and put a board on top with some weight to try to smooth them out.  It worked pretty good.  If the sun had been shinning I would have left them outside for awhile but it was raining.<br /><br />The lip isn't very tall so I don't know how it would work out in cold country.  Driver's side has the holes for the floor anchors.  Passenger side does not but it much longer.  It covers all the carpet from seat all the way back to up behind the bottom of the glove box.  Well maybe not quite that far and has the bumpy things so it will not move around.<br /><br />I am happy with mu purchase.
736,5,Was on time and works great
737,4,"Great product.  Used it on my 13 jeep Rubicon JK. just put it right after resonator And cut stock heavy myffler off. Not much louder than stock this way, No interior drone!!! If you cut out your resonator and use just the muffler it will be loudest around 2k rpm or under heavy load about 3k WITH interior drone. Make sure to extend your exhaust pipe from what you cut off the factory muffler to help reduce interior noise.<br />I gave it a 4 star because it sounds a hint of ricer (4 cylinder engine). But productworks well, fits perfectly fine by the frame. A solid choice for any jeep jk wrangler that wants to keep it not too loud for family but remove the bad stock muffler that prone to damage."
738,5,Very good
739,5,"I used this push latch to replace the broken, almost impossible to open latches in my 2013 Thor ACE. They use 10lb latches, which are too hard to pull open and they continually snap back closed making it impossible to close the drawer. The 5lb latches are so much nicer and were the exact size of my original, so I was able to use the same holes and only had to change the push latch side."
740,5,"Great experience will All Balls. Like a lineman in football, there's only a problem if you notice them, and these things keep me confident between tire changes. Great packaging and shipping time as well."
741,1,These are an inferior product.Very spongy at best.Only have a 30 day warranty.Do not recomennend at all.
742,5,Great product for price
743,3,All most like oem
744,5,This decal is great quality and appeared as described and shown. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes Sailor Moon!
745,5,if you need a connector that you can easily separate than these are the best. all you need are the correct crimpers
746,5,worked great
747,5,These look amazing. A little difficult to put in but totally worth it.
748,5,"I have a 1999 Mazda Miata and because of the freezing temps in my area, I needed to purchase this jumper in case my car wouldn't start.  It worked!  Now, I feel a bit more secure going out by myself and not having to ask a stranger for a jump."
749,5,Fit exactly.  No problems.
750,1,Received wrenches and I am missing the 6an wrench. Waiting for a reply.
751,5,"Put on my 2012 xf myself, installation was easy and fits perfect."
752,5,Fantastic product made my 01 f150 run like it did new and these 8 are cheaper than a single coil from a parts store
753,1,it didn't fit
754,4,Provides additional length during diagnostic testing
755,5,excellent product wish it was cheaper
756,4,Looks good
757,1,"Even though it claimed not to make any noise without lubricants applied, there was brake squeal at very low speeds when coming to a stop. It was very loud and persistent the first week but after a few weeks, it has finally calmed down. I still hear it when going from ~3MPH to 0MPH whereas before I could hear it from ~10MPH to 0MPH braking. I am sure it will be totally gone in a couple of weeks. Otherwise they are great pads that give me confidence in stopping abruptly when needed.  EDIT: Alright so I was hoping the noise would go away by now. It is still present and pretty obnoxious. Not a good reason for people to turn heads to towards my car. I contacted the manufacturer through the support email and after a week, there has still been no reply. Next time, I'm paying extra for a better brand."
758,5,Just what i need.! thx amazon.!
759,1,"First off. The seller has been great.<br />I ordered these headlights for my 2014 dodge ram 1500.<br />they arrived on time. they fit perfectly and looked good.<br /><br />but the light pattern that these headlights throw is horrid,<br /><br />they do not have a clean cut off. the projector is slanted. and there is a horrible rainbow effect with dark spots.<br /><br />this is my second set, the seller was great and sent me another when i had the same problems with the first ones.<br /><br />these headlights are just unsafe and i wouldnt recommend them to anyone."
760,4,Exelent product!! Fast delivery! Fit like a condom!!!
761,5,Arrived on time and as expected.
762,5,It fit my 09 6.4 superduty.
763,5,fits well.
764,5,THIS WAS A REALLY A GOOD PRICE AND PRODUCT!!!!
765,5,"This was a direct fit for my mini chopper,came with all hardware necessary."
766,5,This is a great 12 volt connector. The heavy guage wire makes it great for many different projects. The only downside is the blue LED power indicator is super bright.
767,5,Works great!!!
768,5,A1
769,5,Perfect! The texture is nice and it slipped into my car's steering wheel without an issue. I even bought a pink one!
770,4,did what it said it was going to do what more can I ask for the delivery was pretty good
771,5,Works as well as big store stuff and it screws on the hose fitting without tools or hurting my hand. I bought two and use them both.
772,5,"The blue light is very bright when you open the lid, good for seeing in the dark. Very well made, we bought one from the store for more money and it is cheap looking, but this one is sturdy and sleek looking in our car...love it!!!"
773,4,"Replacing old Happi-Jacs, on a used camper we purchased, after 1 gave out. Love the price and how easy they crank, but they definitely don't feel as sturdy as the originals. A lot more sway when raising and lowering than we were are used to. Overall, we are happy with the purchase."
774,5,Bad ass helmet! Looks sweet and is very comfortable.
775,5,great for my ATV
776,1,This does not work on the Honda Civic.  Should have read all the reviews.  waste of my money
777,1,Tried to make 1 cup of coffee. Took almost 20 min before I finally got tired of waiting. Make sure to start your car before turning this power sucking beast on unless you want a dead battery. Gave it to Goodwill
778,5,I own a used car lot and this product is by far the best looking and sculpt to the body lines.  My third order and will get more as needed. Great!
779,1,"I'm not happy with this product . They dont fit my seats, the straps that hold covers on snapped and the steering wheel cover doesn't fit."
780,5,Works great inline in my car to eliminate ground loop feedback and buzzing!
781,3,"Sent back bulbs did not fit harness,  2014 ram 1500."
782,5,The magnetized card makes it quite easy to apply in the automobile windshield.
783,5,Keeps the sand out of my eyes.
784,3,The fit was baggy. For a quick cover up...it's ok. But I'm not so sure they are for a 2007 wrangler.
785,5,"I've never found a proper review or finished product pictures for these lights, so now that I've installed them, I can hopefully help those who need it.<br /><br />PACKAGING:<br /><br />Everything was packaged perfectly. After opening the main box, each side came in its own box, packed in nice shipping foam. Nothing was damaged during shipment, and it looked very safe and sturdy.<br /><br />INSTALLATION:<br /><br />Installation took about 20 mins, even without having installed lights prior. This video shows everything you need to know. Spyder Auto Installation: 2010-13 Volkswagen Golf…: http://youtu.be/3lXcZ5q0rPg<br /><br />The reverse lights were the only bulbs that needed to be installed, and it plugged into the factory wiring.<br /><br />END RESULT:<br /><br />The car looks much nicer with the new tails. It definitely helps it to be unique. The white and black are a welcome change from the red, and everything worked without incident. The white led tubes light up red, as well as the individual led strips in between them. The bottom of the outer lights are the turn signals, and the bottom of the inner lights is the reverse lights."
786,5,Perfect for my truck bed near tailgate for groceries. Just needed to rig the set up and get some snap clips so I didn't drill into my bed
787,5,"So far, no problems."
788,4,I thinks decently made. People are complaining that its too small. Well its a trash bin for the car. What in the world are you dumping in that bin that makes you think its small?
789,5,they been on my truck for a while and they work and look very good
790,4,solid hitch d-ring.  functional as it is not permanently attached and can be used on front mount receiver if intalled. paint doesnt last and easily rusts.
791,5,"Very cool lock.  Easy to follow instructions, and with a simple twist of the key it is now keyed to my Jeep.  Used this to lock a trailer.  Matching key rocks, allowing me to drop a key from my keychain.  Obviously selling your vehicle reduces the re-usability of this lock.  The body of the lock itself is a little bulky and the bolt is a little thick, so I don't see it fitting in tight spots, or the bolt fitting in small holes / openings.  I will buy more of these for other projects or applications."
792,4,Arrived 3 days early. Works Great!! Perfect Fit. I own a Klipsch ProMedia GMX A-2.1 Computer Speaker System and finding a replacement fuse has been a major hassle. that was until I found this link and product. Recommend highly!! Hopefully mentiojning this in the review will make the search easier for someone with the same speaker system.
793,5,"very good tool. well Bilet tool. a must have if you are into old cars of the 70,s 80,s and 90,s!!!"
794,4,This product is pretty ingenious - easy to install and easy to use. It folds up nicely and is not obtrusive on the windshield. Much classier than those fold up models. Very clean look when open too!
795,5,Perfect
796,4,Good quality.  Looks very nice.
797,5,"Fit great, solid stamped metal"
798,5,Worked beautifully. Saved a lot of time over BMW factory procedure.
799,5,Fit properly on the bike
800,3,Can anyone tell me what to do to keep the check engine light from going off after replacing the cat converter to this?
801,5,It would have saved me a lot of trouble doing mechanical work for the last 50 plus years!  Super tool and put it at the top of the ratings if you would.
802,5,"love it! I finally got the sound i wanted. Had the thrush welded muffler and it wasn't as loud or aggressive as i wanted. This muffler give the perfect sound, is higher pitch so its loud but also low enough that its aggressive. So glad i got this muffler"
803,4,nice
804,5,"Very satisfied with the delivery time frame. Fi2000 PWRPRO Tuner arrived in good condition, correct model as advised prior to purchase. The Fi2000 PWRPRO (Auto Tuner) installed in under 2 hours on the Stratoliner. Bike starts up with less cranking effort and engine EFI systems run as advertised. Just need some spring time to get the Stratoliner out on the road.<br /><br />Cheers."
805,4,"Good product, trusted brand and great price.  Make sure it will be enough wattage for your purposes."
806,5,Can't go wrong with Master Lock.
807,3,I'm sure it great. Haven't installed it in the car yet
808,5,"One of the best of these. For those who say it didn't work, many are connecting it to a dead battery and waiting. A fully drained car battery will deplete these lithium batteries in no time. You should connect it and immediately start your car. Don't try to use it to recharge your car battery and dont leave it connected before (or after)  your car starts."
809,5,"fit as expected , nice quality kit"
810,5,This is quite a nice tool.  It's small quiet and put air into the tire.  We will use it when we travel and rent a car.  This and a can of tire sealer in the trunk give me peace of mind.
811,4,pumps nice
812,1,Came apart at the seams !  Literally
813,4,Shipping was fast. Our seats are on the small side therefore the covers do not fit very snugly. It is a good temporary solution until we repair the seat covers.
814,5,chains work good---good price
815,5,Work like it should
816,4,Great
817,4,very good product
818,1,These are a piece of crap will never buy another one
819,3,"Even though the description SAYS Bluetooth capable, it is not. Wifi only. Not a huge deal, but when I'm sitting in the driveway being manly and clearing check engine codes, I have to switch back to my home Wifi network to look up the problem code. Bought it because it said &#34;Bluetooth&#34; in the description. Would have gone through the trouble of returning it and getting what I wanted, but at least it works."
820,2,did not seem to hold well for my use
821,5,Excellent deal
822,5,Best product for helping restore Fuel Tank Sensors when Techron quits working.
823,2,"It's really cool but defiantly not a flat ended tip like in the picture, it has a slanted tip to it, but still cool..."
824,5,Works great
825,3,Looks great!  However be aware this will not fit into an 1 1/4 hitch without modifications to the mounting angles and possibly your hitch. Nothing a mechanically  competent person with a drill and a hacksaw couldn't do in 15 minutes though.
826,1,did not fit
827,5,"Looks great, installs easily. Exactly what I expected."
828,5,"Another excellent accent item for my 2010 Mini Cooper S. Bought my mini as a second owner, missing OEM lighter. I will not be using this item, but it adds a little flair to the interior of my car. Blue LED only operates when lighter is depressed."
829,5,Buenas piezas
830,1,it broke in just a month.
831,5,Sure get attention being close to base! ;-)
832,4,"I really like this tool, it is easy and convenient to use."
833,5,easy to install and works fine
834,3,not worth the $  plastic cheap
835,3,great jacket very protective and nice to have the vents when your riding in the summer months of southern california however the jackets do run very small. i normally wear a 2xl shirts so i got the 3xl so i wasnt constrained while riding and i could barely move with the jacket or let alone ride my bike.
836,5,As advertised
837,5,"Product was what I needed and what I expected.  I just received the product, so I can not yet rate on durability, but I am hopeful it can hold up to my young kids.  Also, was impressed by the seller engagement.  They reached out to me to see if I had feedback (which I gave) and they followed up quickly with a response."
838,5,Why pay more ?
839,2,"Original exhaust on car lasted about 12 years before it had to be replaced. In that's in north east weather. Replaced everything from engine back only to have it rust out again in less then 2 years! The y pipe from walker rusted out and snapped off, then while replacing this, noticed that the 2 muffler had rust and to through on both of them too. Walker replaced the mufflers under warranty, but had to jump through hoops. Ended up getting most of the cost of the new y pipe covered as well, but walker typically does not warranty that part. Walker was good to deal with, although I'm not happy with how fast these parts rusted. Amazon was a pain to deal with regarding the exchanges!!"
840,2,"You can't beat the price. My Toyota dealer wanted 80 bucks for the remote and $145 to program it. Using the software and cable sold here on Amazon and 15 minutes of my day, I got this one working. The only reason it took 15 minutes is that the software kept crashing and I had find instructions on YouTube for doing it. I was happy to see wifi worked out in my driveway. For an experienced person, it is at most a 5 minute job. Time to find another Toyota dealer. Charging $145 labor for a 5 minute job is close to fraud. Of course if I had bought the \\""keys and remote\\"" warranty, there would have been no charge.    The remote isn't exactly Toyota quality, but it isn't bad either. Not that Toyota quality is that good for this part. The buttons on this one are a little too easy to press. I see no difference in range between the factory remote and this one. This remote is for my wife to keep in her pocketbook and maybe use a few hundred presses a year. I'll buy a used Toyota remote on eBay for a spare. The truck computer will store 4 remotes in memory. Total cost for the software, cable and remote...$45.  Can't complain.    Edit a few days later:     I am revising this review and dropping my rating for this product. While it works, the design is very poor. The buttons protrude out so far from the device that the remote sitting in the bottom of my wife's pocketbook has set off the panic alarm twice. One time it happened when she just shook the table the pocketbook was sitting on. I'm sure it would do the same in a jacket pocket. The actual Toyota remote has recessed buttons that make this more unlikely. The good news: The range on this remote is excellent.  I'm going to have to order a real TRW remote and just keep this for an emergency spare. Basically I wasted 20 bucks. They need to re-design this. It is pretty much a waste of money now but wouldn't take much to make the product much better."
841,4,"It fits perfectly in the windshield.  Due to its size, it is a little difficult to insert and remove and roll up again."
842,5,Great service like right product
843,5,This is my SECOND set of these I love them so much. I Originally bought these for my 2000 4Runner Limited two years ago and because of an off roading mistake ended up breaking one. Only tip I have during installation be careful with how you position the front channels. Otherwise the anti trap feature will bounce the window back. I always install and put a small amount of lithium grease on the channel on the window side and problem solved. Excellent product. BUY THESE.
844,4,works as advertized
845,5,"Slightly different fit than OEM controls, had to thighten clutch cable quite a bit after installing lever due to this. But works great. Great replacement for the bent lever I had."
846,1,"VERY, VERY poor quality!  I've spent months and lots of extra money troubleshooting an electrical issue in my RV.  Turns out it was these cheap fuses causing the problem.  Once I replaced the fuse with one of the original manuf. fuses the problem went away.  Do yourself a favor...Buy quality, not quantity when it comes to these fuses!"
847,5,"great product, works as intended."
848,5,"It fit perfectly but didn't end up being the problem! The pump had a crack, which leaked like crazy.  Very upsetting to find out after I got everything back together.  Rusty battery tray and bolts made the job 4 hours long!"
849,5,"Incredible value at this price.  I followed the included instructions and paired them to my 2008 Ford Explorer in less than a minute.  Great to have a couple spare remote fobs, as I only had one when I bought the vehicle.  Very, very expensive at the Ford dealer.  I was leery due to the low cost of these, but they work great.  Highly recommend,"
850,5,Perfect addition to a future recovery or repair!
851,5,"Save the box!  I have a 2008 Toyota 4Runner and it fits in the glove box.  Fella helped me out in a parking lot with one of these and my SUV started right up.  I bought one the next day, charged it beforehand and hope I never need to use it."
852,5,Love it keeps battery charged
853,5,NICE PRICE.
854,5,Perfect fix for my problem.  Fast shipping and a quality product.
855,3,"The lights look wonderful. I've gotten many positive comments about them. I hard wired mine to the wires under the truck so they wouldn't show and so I could use the trailer adapter jack for hauling a trailer. A couple of issues though...The wires that lead from the control box to the led bar are the smallest wire I've ever seen. Therefor they are extremely fragile. If you hard wire them the way I did, be sure to run them through some kind of flexible protective sleeve and secure them out of the way to keep them from damage. This is particularly important in areas of the country where snow is an issue. Hard wiring will probably double your installation time. But if you do it right, I think you will enjoy these lights."
856,3,The bra tore at 2 seams where clips sewn to material as I put it on and the bra doesn't come up under the headlight on one side it needed more clips to hold it.
857,5,Sound was great. Didn't sound tinny or like those Honda civics with the coffee cans. As close to a v8 sound as you could get with a v6. Only gripe is the mounting to the original stock brackets. Getting those off was a b*tch.
858,5,The packaging of the new wiper was fairly easy to open. It was easy getting the old blade off and installing the new one.. Now if it would just rain around here I could find out how good the wiper is a clearing the window.
859,5,good
860,5,"Came in 6 packs, its oil."
861,5,This bumper cover was an exact fit and was shipped fast.
862,1,Is there a better place for directions
863,4,Great for cold weather.  Comfy so far.  Not used in rain yet.
864,5,Easy To Install And Fast Shipping I Just Don't Know If The 16' Is Better For A Better Reception Or If Its All The Same But Overall It's Nice.
865,5,"I have had to use this a few times after having friends in my car, and it is great! I also used this in my house to get paint out of the carpet, and it did the job."
866,5,wear a little small but I have a big head too
867,3,"These look very good on a car, however it's clear they're not made very well. There's what looks to be hot glue strings on them, and they tear at the seams to where the filling comes out. For the cheap price, it's not so bad, they lasted the holiday season."
868,5,Works great!
869,5,"I find that these floor mats are wonderful! I always get these for each of my vehicles. They fit perfectly and keep my car carpets clean. I live in the mountains of Colorado and get lots of snow, ice, mud, dirt, etc. in my car at different times of year. They clean up easily. Also an important factor for me is.... they are MADE IN THE USA!"
870,5,Awesome... its the original.
871,5,"Nice package.  Worked out of the box with batteries included (and probably never have to be replaced.)    This is good for people like me who like driving long distances at night.    Before the journey, I recommend putting it on in the mirror so you understand the orientation and can put it on without looking.  The photo in the manual shows you are supposed to put it parallel to the ear, but I found it's better to keep turned closer to the earlobe a tiny bit.    Comfortable and will definitely awake you if you nod off."
872,3,quite expensive
873,4,"I've tried a variety of sunglass holders, and have found these to be one of the better ones I've come across. On others the foam pads often get worn in and hold the glasses loosely.  I've been using these for about six months now and they work as well as the day I received them."
874,5,Well worth the money works great
875,5,Great product - fits and works as expected!
876,5,"Very cool numbers, great price very happy"
877,5,happy
878,2,cheap material
879,5,"Great item  -  saved me a bunch of money  -  not a 2 minute installation, more like 20 minutes, but still very doable."
880,1,"If I could give no stars, I would. These headlights were, in a word, atrocious. There is absolutely no support from the manufacturer. The lights cannot be aimed. They allow water penetration, which meant that both of them had condensation inside the lens at all times. It's a royal pain to fit them to the vehicle. If you're not concerned with function, feel free to fit them, because they're just for show cars and cannot be used legally on the street, regardless of what the box or manufacturer says.<br /><br />In short: don't waste your money on this product."
881,5,Product worked great....until my wife decided to crack the window.
882,5,Really nice. Great price. Great customer service.
883,3,While the license plate light and map lights all for worked great. However the cargo light and dome light are a bit finicky as the seem to be to loose to always make a good connection i sometimes need to tap on the housing to get them to come on.
884,5,great light. very well packaged.
885,5,Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas for his new sled and he loves it!
886,5,Good seller. Good product. The only issue was the bolts the comes with the fog lights were smaller Thanks!!!
887,5,Quick easy install as promised. Great buy so far!
888,5,Old style EZ fits in the mount well and like the fact that you can remove the bracket as well as EZ Pass from the car windshield.
889,5,Good lock
890,2,"Other then having to install the mounting screws and grind them down, the mirrors work great , good quality"
891,5,just like the one from Ford
892,5,"[[ASIN:B00HZFJ4TQ Rola 59789 AP-GTX Series Black Roof Rack for Kia Soul]]Got this rack for our 2015 soul. This is way better than the OEM rack at a great price.  Went to our dealership for our first oil change (only because it was comp.)And the technicians  there couldn't believe the quality and look of the rack. I also purchased the prorack 10 cargo box( Which is a Yakima product) it fits perfectly on the rack and works great . The price for the rack and box is cheaper than a Yakima or Thule box alone.  Both work great on our 2015 Soul.  Only thing to suggest, is when installing the rack, get a heavy-duty torx screwdriver as the tool that comes with it seems like its made mainly for emergencies and not for an actual install. Save some $ and get this rack."
893,5,I needed a blank for my Malibu after breaking my key! The price was right :)
894,5,"NIce!!  Very happy with it, great product, heavy duty, super bright, fast service !!!  I Grade this product.  AAA super plus!!!"
895,5,exact replacement for Coleman  rechargeable air pump.
896,3,I really love the design on the helmet and it provides great comfort.
897,2,Great concept not sturdy. Really disappointed the knob fell off before first use. The knob helps prevent cuts from the sharp metal
898,5,Does what it's supposed to do.
899,5,Great product. Thanks.
900,5,2002 Ford Focus worked great!  http://www.keyfobprogram/fd1 for instruction on how to program.
901,5,"Got this pump to quite things down in my travel trailer (TT).  Instructions say do not put 90s on output lines from pump.  Of course, my TT had two right after the previous pump so I new plumbing was in order.<br /><br />After all was said and done it is a lot quieter now but I believe most of this has to do with the previous plumbing.<br /><br />It does pump a lot more water and has good pressure without pulsing.  I kept the old pump for backup!!"
902,1,This  is a complete RIPOFF!
903,3,I like these. they are cheap and started to shred but they are alright for my use.
904,5,Worked great another excellent product from Mothers!
905,2,the containers were half empty...
906,5,"They were great, luv the keychain"
907,5,What can I say except it gets the job done. Replaced the coolant tank in my 2004 Mini Cooper S with no trouble. Easy to install.
908,5,works great
909,5,"I am honestly a bit shocked at how well this works. Normally I am afraid of chemicals on anything, but so far, everything (yes, everything) I have use this colorless and odorless concentrated cleaner has been amazing.<br /><br />Steering wheel gunk? Check.<br />Wooden coffee table? Check.<br />Paneled wood? Check.<br />Door knobs? Check.<br /><br />The list goes on and on. I'm normally opposed to chemical cleaners and only trust 409, but this is like 409 on steroids. Buy with confidence and apply liberally to everything that needs a clean (not your kid or dog, but you know what I mean)."
910,1,"I purchased this for a Smittybilt XRC 9500lb winch.  My solenoid is mounted in the vertical position and this cover fits, but barely.  It would fit fine if the solenoid was mounted in the more traditional manner (horizontal in the middle, or on top of the motor).  I've had the cover on for about a week and no issues to report.  The only reason I'm rating 4 stars is because I haven't had it long enough to vouch for durability, however it seems very well made.<br /><br />Update:  Less than 1 year and the cover is completely faded and ripped.  Not abused, just didn't hold up.  Surely it must be possible to manufacturer something with more durability."
911,5,Worth every penny!  I will get these for all future cars.  Especially great if you have kids.
912,5,Realy fantastic highlight on front fender
913,5,fast and correct
914,5,Just what we needed for my husbands truck.
915,2,"Just a piece of glass, no backing to replace your mirror. Not very useful, considering there is no way to keep the glass in place."
916,4,"Do not use the plastic little application tool they provide, it will scratch the tint. Besides that amazing film and very dark!"
917,5,I love these -- I save a fortune in paper towels.  I use them for all my house cleaning needs.  Even use them on my swiffer.
918,5,Product showed up on time and works great
919,5,Great Product
920,5,Nice product a+++++++
921,5,nice i like it
922,5,Item is a perfect fit and works great. Fast delivery. Very happy with purchase.
923,5,"Outstanding! Great fit, worked like a champ, quick shipping. Thank you!"
924,4,"As advertised, on time."
925,5,works well and easy to install
926,5,Chain was not what the photo look like
927,5,Works great and looks great on my 2001 xj. Trans cooling line gave me a lil of a issue and radiator cap.<br />Bleeding air out is very important.
928,1,"They work barely, one of the red wires was broken so had to fix prior to install."
929,5,"Perfect fit, loved the fact they came with new bulbs already installed in a new wiring harness. Installed and adjusted both left and right side in less than 45 minutes."
930,4,"Had to work with it to get it to attach but once I did, no problem."
931,2,Item came broken. Had to epoxy the pieces together. Light is not perfectly sealed so I had some condensation inside. The company offered to help but by then I already paid to have it put on the car. The passénger headlamp is skewed downward for some reason. Can't adjust. Good lamps but questionable quality.
932,5,Bought this for 09 vw jsw and worked perfectly.  Originally bought a new unit from ebay.  But it didnt work.  Checked it out with vagcom and all buttons registered...  And everything functioned except for cruise control..  This was 2x the cost of ebay but it works.  And 2.5x cheaper than dealer part 😉
933,5,looks amazing
934,4,These were a great Xmas gift but they were almost too tight on the seat. They ripped right where your butt goes in two months. Good thing I'm a seamstress!
935,5,Worked on my 2013 outback. Not hard to install
936,5,very nice condition husband loved it runs a little bit large but if it just right with another shirt under
937,5,"Can not beat it for the price.  My last one, made it 25 years { from another store }  it is exact in design, love this bag!"
938,3,I have not noticed a difference on any of my vehicles after installing this filter. :(
939,5,Searched the local parts stores and this same item which had to be special ordered with cost and wait time. So with doing my research on here I found the OEM part and couldn't be more happier.
940,1,Pour packed one is not working.
941,5,Good stuff... Works well on my 2002 325Xi though it only gives generic codes.
942,5,"Just what you need on a Ford diesel that does not have a pyrometer; however, it failed after a few weeks.  Edge Products replaced the product and the replacement has worked for a year."
943,5,Excellent quality.  @$!/ Lexus parts
944,4,Fast shipping!! Product as described!!
945,5,Within an hour I was up and running; included wire harness and lamps.  An amazing bargain
946,1,"I'm frankly surprised that I'm the only one that evidently seems to have had a negative experience with these lug nuts; but three out of twelve (so far) have evidently deformed upon tightening and &#34;locked on&#34; to the studs, thus snapping the stud off upon removal (and have to replace the stud).  Has no-one else attempted to remove the nuts and had a problem?  I'm 100% certain that they were *not* over-torqued - every one was torqued to 90 ft-lbs and no more - and I know they weren't cross-threaded - having screwed them down by hand until they were touching the wheel.  The problem was not evident until attempting to remove the nuts."
947,5,Gets the job done
948,5,If have some in your life that is gun crazy these are for them.  Get them the license plate screws too that look like bullet shells and the arrow antenna and there is a cool shifter knob that looks like the grip of a revolver (no barrel on top) and the trigger has spring action.  Who needs a car alarm add your favorite NRA sticker and no one will tailgate or think about trying to rob you.  Just saying.
949,5,"Outstanding Mustang quality as I've come to expect. Just as comfy as the one I had on my 650 Star Classic. Passenger seat takes a bit of work to get the front attachment in the slot, but once in, she's IN! Now if winter would GO AWAY, we can get out and try it!!"
950,5,Works great much cheaper than the same product from the dealer.
951,5,exact replacement
952,5,"Great product, Great Seller"
953,5,"Great product. I used it as a drop-in replacement for the battery in my GE Simon XT alarm system panel. Easy to install, no problems at all."
954,5,Excellent Quality
955,5,Works as advertised.
956,5,It is beautiful.
957,5,"Transporting little ones around in your car can ruin the back of the seats.  No matter what we tried, they just couldn't keep their feet off the seats.  Luckily we found the Kick Mats and now our new car will stay new for a lot longer."
958,5,Perfect fit
959,5,great product
960,3,Kinda too small for my Accord
961,1,Missing gasket. Does not fil well.
962,5,EXACTLY AS I EXPECTED
963,5,Remarkably easy to sew on yourself. and if looks great!
964,1,$85 for a couple of metal brackets? That's ridiculous
965,5,"Great belt. Was still on the factory one at over 200k miles. This one is a little quieter and the new water pump and new tensioner worked great. Fairly easy install, takes a while but end results save over 600$ getting it done at a shop."
966,5,"Fantastic Product!<br /><br />I have a 2010 Honda Element and the battery was completely drained by a combo of door ajar and cold weather.  No clicking or any response when you turned the key.  It had been dead for about 5 days.<br /><br />The instructions for the SSC-1000A are simple enough to follow.  I strongly recommend checking your car's owner's manual before you start.  Honda recommends you disconnect the battery from the car if you are using a charger.  I wasted 3 hours by just hooking up the charger straight to the battery.  It didn't charge, but just indicated that the battery was at 15% and the charging light was blinking.<br /><br />As one other reviewer mentioned: If the charging light is blinking - it is not charging!  Once I disconnected the battery and hooked the positive to the positive and the negative to the metal frame (as indicated in the instructions) the charger indicated that it did not have a connection.  The red light over the &#34;Connected&#34; option shows if the charger is correctly connected.  I tried multiple metal points in the engine cavity to no avail.  Out of sheer curiosity I hooked the negative clamp to the negative battery terminal and low and behold it was the connection the charger wanted.  The charger indicated that the battery had 6% charge to begin with and within about 10 minutes that was up to 34%.  It took 3 hours to get the battery charged up to 89% and the car started right up.  The manufacturer recommends that you charge the battery to at least 77% before trying to start the car.  That gives the battery enough juice to get the engine started.<br /><br />The case is small and the cables fit neatly into the top section.  The cables are long enough to set the unit on the floor and still have enough length to work with.  The plastic seems very cheaply made, but that is just the shell to hold this little miracle machine.  The fan did make a slight noise, but if it is in the garage it shouldn't bother anyone.  I would recommend this to anyone who needs to charge their car battery.  Once I figured out the kinks it was a super fast charger!"
967,5,"I don't use this now, but was great for a road trip."
968,5,"Accidently left ice in the trunk for a day, so a ed expected, water was moving around in the trunk of my car. Long story short, it didn't leak through and it was easy to clean up."
969,4,"light weight, does what it was intended for."
970,4,Very nice productfit my 2013 Ford F 150 perfectly and they look great too it's going to take a little time getting used to the magnification on the mirrors but I think they're going to fit their purpose highly recommend
971,5,Good quality hose and very reasonable price for 100 feet.  Just using it for nostalgic purposes on a driveway signal bell.
972,4,"it fits, and filters air. works for me."
973,4,"Description didn't specify, but these are 18.5&#34; wide x 24&#34; high. Looks good so far, have not mounted them yet. They're are as good a quality HD mud flap as is available for my lifted 2500 HD 4x4. Making a removable mount so that rocks and stones will be blocked from hitting my boat. Nice cheap price too."
974,5,"a tight fit, and works like it should, repairs the broken EOM fob."
975,5,Exactly what I needed for my car. The seller was extremely helpful. I'm very satisfied with the purchase.
976,3,I use these when airsofting with my nephews or occasionally on a half helmet ride around town.  they fit perfectly over my prescription lenses.<br /><br />They really keep the wind out and provide 360 protection from whatever comes your way.<br /><br />They do tend to fog up with ease
977,5,Just what I wanted
978,4,Love the bling. But the little cover button you put on to cover the screw.  Don't stay in they come out very easy.
979,5,"As a shade tree mechanic, this thing is smarter than I am.  Already very helpful, and a lot more to learn."
980,5,I love it exactly what you need for a decent lift
981,5,great
982,5,Very cute & sticks well to the back of my car. I really like it. It also arrived very quickly.
983,5,We love it and the service was great!
984,4,"The product is very much as described. It comes with the shift knob, 3 inserts for different sized shifters, a screw to keep the insert attached to the knob and a visual instruction on how everything goes together. For the product I received, the knob was more purple than green. I am sure each knob is a little different and every customers experience could vary."
985,5,It's coolant. Nice that you don't have to dilute it.
986,5,"works great, was able to figure out what was wrong and replace the part myself, saving a lot of money."
987,4,"Sometimes a bit wobbly so as to lose connection, but nice for traveling to be able to run the GPS and also charge a cell phone at the same time."
988,5,great fit

991,5,Very nice!
992,5,"Cute, I Love it."
993,5,Excellent fully recommend them
994,1,"I was shipped a kit with an incorrect water pump. Certainly not for any Honda engine I've ever worked on. The rest of the kit was of questionable quality. Nothing was made in Japan or the U.S. I wouldn't feel confident running the belt on an interference engine.<br /><br />Vendor did issue a return label, but it was very inconvenient to be shipped the wrong parts and ruin a weekend install. Happy accident, I guess, since this kit isn't up to snuff. Ended up going with the Gates kit; much better quality, U.S. made belt, bearings and water pump."
995,1,"Even though the box said it fit a 2007 Nissan Xterra, the anchor holes did not match."
996,5,light is very bright looks good and works just as it should and it was delivered right on time I will be buying another
997,5,Perfect replacement for my 69 Chevy truck.
998,5,"Perfect replacement, Japanese made!"
999,5,"Impressed how well it fit, item description was perfect."
1000,5,"I've had a good experience using this on the interior surfaces of my 7-yr-old Highlander. It goes on easily, with the consistency of lotion, and doesn't take much work to wipe on. It is in fact dry to the touch fairly quickly. I'd say the results were good, though not dramatic - perhaps my car surfaces just didn't start out worn enough for dramatic restoration. The smell isn't overwhelming or unpleasant (reminds me of leather, or maybe I'm thinking of leather cleaner) and didn't linger too long on hands or in the vehicle. The UV protection is nice, though I can't really verify its effectiveness anymore than I'm certain what protection I get from my own daily application of sunscreen. But if you want a bit of polish after detailing the inside of a vehicle, then I'm certainly pleased with those results."
1001,5,"I want to thank Diode Dynamics for these great products, this 2013 Dodge Dart is my first ever new car and these pieces really set off my interior . With the black interior and the red color of the car, these pieces set it off perfectly. And the aluminum door pockets and red LED lights in the interior, I cant get over how great it looks. Thank you so much.  George Call"
1002,4,Good quality and we are vey pleased
1003,5,"I ordered this kit to keep my wife's bottom warm here during the brutal winters of the upper Midwest.  The kit was relatively easy to install in a 2009 Prius and it works great.<br /><br />********IMPORTANT TIP********<br />I gave this kit a five star review BUT ONLY WITH THIS WARNING....the goofy little connector they provide to tap into the fuse block is pretty much useless.  I'm not sure if it is because a Prius uses the low-profile type fuses but after modifying the connector so it would fit it worked its way loose in a matter of a couple weeks.  The old saying &#34;Happy wife, happy life&#34; is true and a wife with a cold bottom is not a happy one.<br /><br />Here is how you can rescue the situation:<br />http://www.amazon.com/Littelfuse-FHA200BP-ATO-Add-A-Circuit-Kit/dp/B0002BGELQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1421074619&sr=8-1&keywords=add+a+circuit<br /><br />This is little adapter (or something similar to it) lets you add a circuit to a fuse block with absolutely no muss and no fuss. The whole install would have been about half as easy if I had one of these ahead of time.  Get it and get this kit, too!"
1004,5,For the price these are amazing
1005,5,"Outstanding set of affordable heavy duty jumper cables for use on car, pickup, etc.  I am very pleased with the length and the gauge on these cables.  And for the price they are half or less then what I would pay for in auto parts stores.  The length is very handy to have and makes it so much easier to hook up from one auto battery to the other without worrying which direction you are parked or how close you have to get or on what side.  The cable ends, that clip on to the battery posts are very heavy duty and solid, easy to open and close and they clamp down really tight and hold exact to deliver a good jump charge.  Also come with carry case that is nice and handy to have.  I would recommend these to anyone they work really good."
1006,5,Installed easy and works great on my Sonoma. It seems like it's well built.
1007,5,It is am awesome product
1008,5,This product is exactly like ones you buy at GM. The best part is it was only a fraction of the cost. Very happy with my purchase.
1009,5,This fit my 71' aircooled VW just fine.
1010,5,Amazing tool. Top quality
1011,1,Not enough options for mirror mount. No mont to fit higher end auto's etc. Ie mercedes benz
1012,5,works great. thanks.
1013,2,"The picture shows u bolts,washers,lock nuts for mounting with the Hopkins 20019 .The unit I received had no u bolts ,washers or lock nuts"
1014,5,"These towels appear to be of excellent quality. I was particularly impressed that they included an instruction sheet that provided care instructions for microfiber towels. It contained information of which I was unaware. Thank you, BooYah."
1015,4,"Ditto - 6&#34; long, not five, 3&#34; in diameter, high polish aluminum tube that comes in a cheezy drawstring bag -"
1016,5,Excellent goggles!! Delivered fast! Very satisfied!
1017,4,Haven't used it yet but it's what I was looking for.
1018,4,Works and looks great on my 2014 Jeep Cherokee...  It does have a little wind noise at speeds over 75 mph.
1019,3,"its alright, but ,  I thought it would be a little more sturdy.  still alright tho."
1020,5,Good
1021,5,Exactly what I was looking for. The quality was actually better than I had expected for what I paid.
1022,4,"Made of plastic, but it seems durable.  I just hope that the silver stays on in the weather."
1023,5,Great! strong and well made good design although is a bit heavy if you plan to take it on and off often... After the first 1800 miles on our trip is holding really well I would recommend this rack if you want something strong and well made!! Love it !
1024,5,fabulous
1025,5,Great stocking stuffers!
1026,2,its to small
1027,5,work when I got it shipping was here literally right away great purchase definitely would do it again
1028,5,Great prices and prompt delivery!
1029,5,"Fast shipping, quality product."
1030,4,There is a tutorial video on YouTube. Done it within an hour.
1031,5,Perfect gift for anyone
1032,5,Perfect for the S 550. Good value for the dollar  :-)
1033,5,"Fit our 2014 crv perfectly and works exellent! Great value, great price! Same item at the dealer was 200+ dollars, saved a lot of money going with this one!"
1034,5,"Great, but it is $5.79 at AutoZone... just see their website."
1035,1,You can buy a cheaper set for like 45 bucks and there better than these for 70 dollars
1036,5,strong and durable.
1037,5,Excellent !!!!
1038,5,"Excellent. Buy Hengst it is a 1-to-1 fit. Good buy, good price & delivery."
1039,4,It fits well & being leather it keeps me warm.
1040,4,Good fit but there was no hardware
1041,5,Great value
1042,5,If you have a car that has a brake dust problem this is the solution.  Just clean the wheels very good then spray a light coat.  For best results let cure for an hour and repeat.  I always let the final coat bond over night.  When it comes time to wash you can either use a quick detailer on just the wheels or just spray the wheels and the dust will wash off with the water.
1043,3,second time i got this for my mother… last one got hot and melted a bit
1044,5,Noticeably brighter than the stock incandescents and a pure white color. They look great.
1045,2,"We were really disappointed in what arrived. The floor mats are lighter weight than we hoped for and did not have the depth we needed to keep dirt, stones, and water from getting underneath the mats. The bag of retention clips was torn open, so this product came &#34;slightly used.&#34; Apparently someone else didn't like these either. We haven't decided if we're keeping them or not."
1046,4,"A little thinner than I expected for an all weather sticker, but my son loved it."
1047,5,"Nice 3rd light cover plate. I have a 2001 Toyota Tacoma 4x4 and the 2001 3rd brake light is very difficult to take off..it's not like the later models where you can just take the 2 screws off and remove the complete light..To do that you actually have to remove the inside of the cab up top. there is bolts on the 2001 SO, the cover worked well!!! You can still see some of the side of the original light but I liked the way it made that look on my truck..."
1048,5,Great deal on quality wipers.
1049,5,Works as expected.
1050,4,"Well Made, but I should have bought an adapter to fit 1/2 &#34; A/N fittings or fine NPT Threads--(my mistake)"
1051,1,"I bought 4 of these last winter for replacements for my Polaris snowmobile lights. I used it for probably a total of 10 or 20 hours last year and maybe 2 hours this year and then it died. Luckily, I had a couple extras still. I will update if the next one lasts only this long. I'd love to return this one for a refund, but of course its over 30 days from an Amazon perspective and not sure if it's worth the warranty claim for a $8 bulb. Lets hope it was a fluke and the next one lasts as long as it should"
1052,5,The carrying bag could be bigger. But I like it.
1053,5,Everything works great easy install.
1054,5,These are great! I put on on my hard hat and all the guys at work leave me alone now!
1055,5,Works great
1056,5,Product just as described. Would purchase from this vendor again.
1057,3,It's a bit snug but should wear into place nice. Add plexy-glass and now it's like a full door. I'm happy with it.
1058,5,"This sensor, while designed for a BMW, was successfully installed in my 1986 Porsche Carrera and works just as expected."
1059,5,"Perfect fit, simple installation."
1060,3,"Pivot hole on the passenger side mirror arm was drilled wrong, had to drill a hole 180 deg. from the hole that was in the arm"
1061,5,Excellent
1062,5,Top Quality.  Delivered on time.  Exactly as advertised.
1063,4,Not as described for adjusting low beam headlight. #2 Phillips is what you should use.
1064,5,Works great no problems
1065,2,"The fitting is nice.... but it's the wrong one for the part number.  This is supposed to be a 6 an male to 12 an male straight cut o-ring.  I received a 1-1/16&#34; straight cut o-ring to 6 an.  The part number is wrong, but the description is right.  No big deal.  I'll return and hopefully get the right fitting.  I'll post back with my experience.<br /><br />On the plus side, I did order another fitting which was the right one.<br /><br />from Fragola catalog:<br /><br />AN Size: -6, SAE (O-ring size):  11/16-12 (12), Part number: 495114BL"
1066,5,"Works great, and fits perfectly in my 2002 Kia Rio."
1067,3,Not quite the right fit but it works.
1068,5,very reliable!
1069,5,"Excellent product, excellent seller. Fit my car perfectly. Thanks."
1070,4,Price was good...very plain black cover... no frills but does the trick...came home and my wife had already took the old one off and installed this herself...probably better than I would have...I would buy this again! By the way we installed this on our 2004 Sport model Rav4...
1071,5,OK!
1072,5,Great bulbs !!! Easy install
1073,5,Great
1074,5,Perfect digital fit liners for the Honda Odyssey.  Doesn't get any better.
1075,2,very hard to make fit
1076,5,Great cover
1077,5,"My first purchase had a faulty part, and I ended up just buying a new bulb to avoid the hassle of the return process. Kensun had contacted me and I just ignored it as I already decided to fork out the extra money to get it installed. Well, that was like a year or so ago, and they recontacted me to see what they could do to make things right again, because I wasn't thrilled that they couldn't just send me a replacement bulb so I was not a completely satisfied customer. Having never had a seller go so far out of their way to satisfy their customers, I must say Kensun is the best. Most would have just let it go after so long, but they were determined to maintain their reputation for customer service.<br />So as for this product, I did love the improvement the lights made, but at the time I drove an old truck with dulled headlamps so I didn't get to experience the full clarity of the light, but even so, I saw a pleasant improvement above any halogen bulb. Took around a minute to warm up, I found properly mounting and wiring to be kinda of a challenge but eventually I got it and had no problems. I will say if you are tempted to test the bulb prior to mounting the ballasts, don't. Have them properly mounted to the chassis for grounding before applying any power. I had a 4th of July moment in my driveway when I did that. As an electrical engineer I knew I should have, but I let them float and when it touched the chassis it sparked up in my face and blew a fuse. Patience is not my strong suit. Anyways, these were definitely an upgrade over any halogen bulb out there, and made an improvement even with my old headlamp assemblies all scuffed up."
1078,5,Very good
1079,5,Removed all the fine scratches and swirl marks and gave a excellent finish
1080,5,Perfect.
1081,5,I found VW Golf R rubber floor mats at Fowlers VW! Good pricing for the hard to find product. Thank you!
1082,5,"Although I haven't used it thus far, it will be put into use for the next camping season. It appears to be well constructed of a heavy gauge plastic and the wheels appear substantial enough for hauling short distances.  All of the fittings were included and hookup is simple enough.  I'm sure it will perform, as advertised, for its intended use."
1083,5,Thanks
1084,5,"On time correct product, happy over all"
1085,4,Easily installed looks great.
1086,5,thumbs up
1087,5,"Great filter and a perfect 1:1 oem replacement for a 94 Geo Metro. I repair metros as a hobby. I recommend relocating the fuel filter to under the hood and buying a cheaper wix inline filter. If that is beyond the scope of your abilities, this works great on a stock system."
1088,4,"Works just like it's supposed to, the only gripe I have about it is the rubber cover slides off easily."
1089,5,Great
1090,5,Great
1091,2,Could never get it programmed.
1092,5,"great product, excellent quality"
1093,4,Fun
1094,5,this is a life saver if you want to keep batteries at the proper level this is it
1095,5,Heavy duty - excellent quality
1096,5,keeps all the yuppies away from my race car
1097,5,Exactly as described
1098,5,"Super simple to install.  Superior quality.  Also, no regrets going with the 25' cord model which allows me to charge my car whether I back in or not, or if I park on the opposite side of my two car garage.  Long enough to also snake under the garage door to charge vistors' vehicles in the driveway!<br /><br />***NOTE*** Ignore the 14-50R pigtail & receptacle that appears in the &#34;Frequently Bought Together...&#34; section.  This is a 30-amp unit and IS NOT ideal to be on a 50amp circuit which is what all the electricians was quoting to install based on the connector cord & receptacle I had on-hand..  A 3-conductor 14-30R pigtail with 14-30R receptacle is what you will need."
1099,5,use this everyday. make my life bettrer
1100,5,Perfect fit
1101,5,Bought two orders . Nice solid tool. Hope to never use it but have piece of mind when I travel now!
1102,4,"This was exactly what I was looking for for my boyfriend (probably the biggest HIMYM fan ever). The only reason this did not get 5 stars is because there was slight chipping on the blue paint but no big deal, I am sure it is going to get worse anyway."
1103,5,exactly the look I wanted.  key socket fits nicely into the tight holes in the wheel.
1104,1,Don't do it.<br /><br />I bought the K&N engine air filter for my 2013 MDX... mileage went from 17.5 to 15... ran 3 tanks through.  Went and got an OEM and it went back to 17.5.
1105,3,"The first time I purchased this tape was in July 2014. The second time I purchased it was in October 2014. I was pleased both times. The tape was very heavy, thick, had a neat tear and excellent coverage over the black surface I needed it for.<br /><br />The third time I purchased was in November 2014, and boy has it changed. Now it's very thin and no longer cover the black surface I used to use it for, as the black now shows through the tape, and, it tears ragged.<br /><br /> All three times was purchased by Amazon.<br /><br />Could it be that the manufacturer was getting so much business that out of greed they change the texture of the product by making it thinner and cheaper to produce more tape, save more money, yet make more money in the long run?<br /><br />In any case, it no longer serves the purpose I need it for. Guess I'll be searching for a different manufacturer."
1106,5,"Perfect, this is exactly as pictured."
1107,5,"There are thicker and softer ones but these serve their purpose and its a great value for the price. I use them everywhere for cleaning - bathrooms, kitchen, dusting, kids room."
1108,5,As described; fast delivery and easy to install. The mats fit very well and keep all of the dirt/ snow and slush off of all of the carpeted areas. You need to remove the factory carpeted mats before you install the liners. Happy!
1109,5,"It took me months to decide how to add DRLs to my Nissan LEAF, since Nissan doesn't offer them in the US.  I originally had 2 sets of those cheap China LED strips ready to go in, but now I'm glad I changed my mind (there's just no comparison).<br /><br />This design also doesn't show any individual LED bulbs, just a light bar, which makes you stand out from the DRL aftermarket crowd.  If you put them in the right location, it would even look OEM.  Color temperature wise, the bulbs seem to match my OEM LED headlights (which are around 5000 K).<br /><br />The entire assembly has a very high quality feel, with a painted aluminum housing, glass lenses and quality wiring.  The lights are much brighter than those Chinese LED strips, plus the brackets do a great job securing the lights.<br /><br />*** Installation ***<br /><br />Installation took me a long time for several reasons.  The bracket is recessed, so the front of the bracket doesn't line up with the front of the lens.  This makes it extremely difficult to guess where to mount the bracket, especially when dealing with a rounded bumper.  I also decided to use screws instead of tape, as I deal with a lot of snow & ice.<br /><br />Also be aware that the lights aren't removable once you install them in the bracket (DON'T test fit them), so you only got 1 shot to get this right.  I wish some sort of template was included, as it could have saved me a huge amount of time & stress.<br /><br />The holes in the brackets make it also impossible to use a standard screwdriver bit.  The only bit I could make work was the &#34;DEWALT IMPACT READY FlexTorq Bit&#34;, combined with a DEWALT Right Angle Adapter, because I was dealing with such a low-profile bumper area, my regular 90&#34; adapters couldn't even fit.<br /><br />I also had to slightly angle them, so they would follow the contour of the bumper.  I was concerned that this would make them less visible, but it looks like the beam angle is wide enough to compensate for this.<br /><br />*** Wiring ***<br /><br />The 3M wiretap that came with the kit did not work for me (in fact, I had to recover it, and use Liquid Tape to repair the wire).  I ended up using T-taps which can be disconnected, allowing me to remove these lights without worrying about wire damage.<br /><br />The lights are designed to be driven by the included controller (do not hook these lights up directly to the 12V battery!), so you need to make sure you have space to mount this unit somewhere within reach of the battery and fuse box.<br /><br />These lights are also advertised to be compatible with electric vehicles, which they obviously are (this was a real problem with the DayLight 8 & DayLight 4 lights), but you do have to tap the headlight wire as well, since it wouldn't work by just measuring the 12V battery load.<br /><br />*** Performance ***<br /><br />While these lights are very bright, they can't be a replacement for headlights (obviously) and fog lights.<br /><br />I also appreciate how the lights dim when you turn your headlights on, as they are very bright at night.<br /><br />The lights stay on for a short amount of time after your vehicle has been turned off, which is a nice feature, but I wish the timer was adjustable.<br /><br />Note to Nissan LEAF owners: charging your vehicle, turning on HVAC remotely, and some other scenarios, can trigger these lights to come on.  I like it for various reasons, but you might not.  I guess it's detecting major fluctuations in the 12V battery, enough to trigger the controller.<br /><br />*** Conclusion ***<br />Would I buy these lights again?  Probably.  I haven't found any other lights which look this nice at this price level.  These can be difficult to find (they are imported), and pricing seems to have gone up, making purchasing these a difficult decision.<br /><br />I really like the 'bar' look, as the individual bulb look is just too cheesy IMO.  I wish the lights were just a little bigger<br /><br />I purchased mine via Prime ($219) from Chok Holdings back in August 2014, so it was easy to return them if something did go wrong, but it looks like this is no longer an option.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* They look fantastic.<br />* High quality housing, brackets and wiring.<br />* Compatible with electric vehicles.<br />* Dim when headlights are in use.<br />* Stay on for a short amount of time after turning off vehicle (this might be a con for some people).<br />* Low power consumption.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Price.<br />* Can't be removed from brackets without damaging bumper (if using screws to mount) and the product.<br />* No templates included.<br />* Bracket design could be improved."
1110,1,Rusted within the first week on the car.  Terrible product
1111,4,"While a bit costly I've seen about a 1-2 mpg improvement while highway cruising with my 2014 Subaru BRZ.<br /><br />I'm only giving this four stars because I have not run virgin oil analysis (VOA) and used oil analysis (UOA) and therefore do not have tested evidence to rate higher.<br /><br />This oil was well recommended on Subaru BRZ / Scion FR-S / Toyota GT-86 forums.<br /><br />Also, I like to give the best to my engines, and considering the breakdown seen between VOA and UOA on some leading brand oils in the FA20 while this one holds up extremely well in other people's tests, I would say it is well worth the additional cost to protect your engine."
1112,1,Worked okay. ..one time.
1113,5,Very nice
1114,5,great product!
1115,5,Good quality
1116,5,delivered fast and the fit was great!
1117,4,A stud is a stud
1118,5,No more squeaking noise!  Minimum brake dust as well!  Got the brakes for all 3 of my cars (different fitting) and way cheaper and better than local shops.
1119,5,Very bright and nice!
1120,5,"Not as much space as I expected, but it fills up the space under the seat.  Overall, nice product."
1121,5,Works great!
1122,5,I work on it all from D11 dozers to f150s. I use these all the time. Unbelievable value and quality. The size range is awesome and the fact they didn't skip any sizes like all the other manufacturers are doing will insure me buying alot more gp products. I grab all the new guys and make sure they know about this set and brand.
1123,4,All Ford parts and labels
1124,5,COMPACKED AND EASY TO USE
1125,5,Well Pleased
1126,5,worked perfectly.
1127,5,"I've had this in my new Nissan Frontier for a year now, it works great. I got the stabilizer & recommend you do the same. Its strong metal, one you get it into a perfect spot, just leave the middle clamp halfway closed and you can pull / push it over your lap when you are ready to use your laptop without fiddling with the adjustment clamps anymore. I researched alot of mounts, this one was a perfect choice. Anything cheaper is not worth buying."
1128,5,"An easy to use, inexpensive solution to my BMW 5 series car's dying battery.  Until I purchased this device, my BMW required a jump start after sitting in the garage for a week or so.  The Dealer said that the electronics drain the battery and it needs to be driven 25 miles a day, which I can't do due to travel requirements.  Now the trickle charger does its magic while I am gone and I have left the car in the garage for three weeks and it still started perfectly."
1129,5,works great for toyota tundras special needs
1130,5,"We've purchased two of these, one for '08 TL, one for '09 Camry. It works really well for us."
1131,4,Works great!
1132,5,Easy to install and looks good.
1133,4,SO FAR IT'S WORKING THOUGH I HAVEN'T FIGURED HOW TO HOOK IT TO A SWITCH AND STILL USE THE STROBE LIGHT
1134,3,"Vest fits perfectly for a tall size, delivery was ahead of expected delivery,  vest arrived in new condition with one small white spot on it. Not obvious, but on the front."
1135,1,It has EYES. I didn't believe the reviews that said it had eyes because it didn't look like that in the photos provided. It indeed has eyes. Don't get.
1136,4,"This camera mount works great on my motorcycle handlebars.  But I had hoped that it would fit on the crashbars too.  Even though the diameter of the crashbars is at the very top of the published range, the bracket would not fit."
1137,5,"Products are good , costumer service is just as good, would recommend to anyone."
1138,5,Excellent product. Makes it easy to attach my float charger to my motorcycle once a week during the winter!
1139,5,Great quality
1140,5,"Ever since I started using these, I loved them!! No more choking feeling, very nice and secure!"
1141,5,"Little on the small side but feels tough<br />Should b able to choke wheels from moving<br />If u have a big RV, might have to consider bigger sizes"
1142,5,"Fit pretty good took about 5 minutes to install, took longer getting it out of the box and storage bag. The folding panels are very nice and easy to use. It was what I expected from smittybilt, I have always gotten good quality products through them. I would recommend to someone who wants to save a few bucks but still get a very nice product."
1143,5,Good price...works fine...would buy again.
1144,5,Works great on my Victory air shock at a great price.
1145,4,"Seriously, kudos to Amazon for alerting me this product will not fit the 2015. That (good) customer service alert caused me to call the manufacturer's customer service line.<br /><br />The Bestop Customer Service Rep told me by telephone today that 42703 model does fit the 2015 Jeep Wrangler (2 door) with subwoofer."
1146,5,Greats items
1147,5,"I purchased this a week ago and they arrived today.  Love, love, love them!!!!!  I have a young child who loves to kick his dirty feet.  He can now....😊:D"
1148,5,"Great Product, Perfect 1st time fit for my 2002 Lexus ES300<br /><br />Isolated all vibrations from the engine as if the engine was yet to start.."
1149,1,"DO NOT BUY! Don't waste your money on this. This is a flimsy sticker that doesn't even stick well. After 2 days, the sticker fell off and would not re-stick. TRASH!"
1150,2,Hi car me is a decent device but I don't think I'll b buying another one unless the update it with what the codes mean so I don't have to go online and search obd 2 codes
1151,4,"My son likes it. He has not tried in very cold weather yet. Will update.<br /><br />P.S.: I tried it on and thought it pushed my nose in, a bit too much... And I could feel the air from my breathing, into my eyes... Hmm... Maybe I did not fit it properly. My son is okay with it, therefore I gave 4 stars."
1152,5,The holes lined up right and looks good.
1153,3,This might be good for off road motorized bikes but this is way to thick to be used on a bicycle. It seemed to just fall off the chain and get clumped up on my derailleur and bike frame.
1154,4,Very nice but fell slightly from fitting on the clip
1155,4,Works as expected
1156,5,Worked great on my 2008 Hyper.
1157,4,Shipping arrived as promised. Product worked well and cleaned several of my leather furniture pieces.
1158,5,"Have run several of these afe dry filters. As far as I can tell, they filter well, and not having to oil them is nice. I run speed density so I don't have to worry about oil in the maf sensor but I still prefer these. Quick and easy to clean and slap it back on."
1159,5,Seals good and locks perfectly on a 2009 Chevrolet Silverado!
1160,5,I installed it and it fixed my problems.  Not an easy task to install took about three hours
1161,5,good product
1162,5,"Quality looks good. Size is as stated, I ordered xl, 27.5cm length of shoe cover. I got these to wear over the waterproof socks on my dry suit while entering and exiting my kayak. These should work as there is little room to spare inside the kayak. Shipping was extremely fast."
1163,5,Excellent
1164,5,"It went in perfectly and looks great on the back window of my car.  As an extra bonus, my Yankee loving neighbor has to look at it every day!"
1165,5,excellent product at an exceptional price!
1166,4,Seems to work just fine.  fixed the problem
1167,4,Not bad!
1168,5,"Holy intake sound Batman...  Easy install, Looks great, Performs even better, Sounds amazing . 2004 Tundra!"
1169,5,Holds up well for the price
1170,5,"This saved me from having to buy a new remote once my Honda Odyssey 2004 remote stopped staying together, and looks and works much better than the tape which I had been using to hold the plastic casing together.  Perfect!"
1171,5,Very useful and excellent article.
1172,4,"Works great with my 08 BMW 535i.<br /><br />What I love is the customer support, they are responsive.<br /><br />Why 4 stars and not 5<br />1. It's expensive combined with the software<br />2. They can do a better job of the documentation, it's not clear what each setting is on the car menu and also I've had it hang once while coding. While the tech support said it's safe I would still prefer not taking a chance to brick my ECU. So I need to start over each time I finish one coding session (ie. reconnect, reread the settings etc etc). Don't start a second session without ATLEAST rereading the ECU settings to avoid issues.<br />3. The dev team has noted that there are sometimes the devices reads X (e.g. light feedback disabled) but the ECU really has Y (light feedback enabled), while they say unless you change it it won't send it back to the ECU (minimal return path) it can still be &#34;confusing&#34; and &#34;worrysome&#34; to the inexperienced/paranoid folks. This is something they can/should fix.<br /><br />Also note the logo doesn't match the logo given in the BMWhat wesbite (it shows a BMW logo), this one apparently is updated. It isn't a fake."
1173,4,"The finish did not come as I expected, however it's a great product."
1174,2,"This item was represented as being made in Germany and the box had a label pasted on it &#34;made in Germany&#34; but the box itself was marked &#34;made in China&#34; and the metal base of the bulb was stamped &#34;made in China&#34;.  I have to believe that this item was made in China , not Germany and I wonder just how long this unit will last. That does not make me a happy camper!!  I think I was overcharged for a Chinese item and I would not have purchased it had I known that it was made in China."
1175,5,I returned a store purchase of the wiper their catalog said was OEM for my vehicle. It was 4&#34; short. This one works well.
1176,4,Good easy to use gasket.
1177,5,Works great!
1178,5,"Awesome boots, at an affordable price...I went down while wearing these and they saved my ankle!"
1179,5,"Looks close close to factory air filter,  meaning excellent quality. Will most likely purchase, again."
1180,5,I have used this product for years. It is great at removing the California dust!  It is not meant to clean the car from dirt.
1181,4,Works as they should got normal wear out of them so far.
1182,5,easy to use. fun to play with. saves time.
1183,4,Just as described easy to install. The only problem was one of the holes for the screw was inline with the cord on back which made it difficult to use. The price was right and works great so far.
1184,5,could not find it any other place.
1185,5,perfect
1186,5,Works well. As described.
1187,1,not impressed hard to set do not keep setttings
1188,4,Very adequate for the usage level I have. I periodically leave on the headlights for my old beater Honda Civic after I park. Decided to get this to avoid those embarrassing waits for folks to help me. Worked fine for the times after I bought it.
1189,5,No complains about this product it fit perfectly.
1190,5,Worked great out of the box
1191,5,"Best price and quality.<br />Thank you,"
1192,5,Can't beat it for the money. Hard to install but do the job nicely and look pretty cool.
1193,5,200% better then the one that came with the trailer.
1194,4,Easy to install and work as brakes should.
1195,5,Great decal. I'll be ordering more soon..!!
1196,5,Worked perfect for my 2008 silverado
1197,5,Great fit as usual 2014 Chevy Silverado 1500 5.3l
1198,5,Nice
1199,4,"Bought this for my 72 CB175. It fits perfectly and functions well. The only reason it is four instead of five stars is that both fuel tubes come disconnected from the main housing. The reserve tube fits in its respective hole tightly enough, but the main tube is going to need to be flared, or held on with some sort of liquid resistant JB weld because is slides right in and out. All in all, great and affordable."
1200,5,"This is a great bike rack. Installation is easy, and contrary to what many people have reviewed, it is very sturdy. We have cruising bikes, which are heavy and irregularly shaped, but this rack handles them quite well. It has survived a cross country move and much more."
1201,5,Perfect welds and sized accurately. Perfect for project build or missile car.
1202,5,The best floor liners you can buy. I called costumer service and they helped me a lot. They're the  best...
1203,5,Fit perfect in my 2015!
1204,5,Thank you very much.<br /><br />Excellent products and services.
1205,5,A little pricey but worked just fine.
1206,4,I haven't had a chance to use it but both my father and my father-in-law were very impressed with my purchase.
1207,5,This is the only thing to use for sealing a bathtub/shower - RTV Silicone. It will last for over 10 years under normal conditions.
1208,3,As Described
1209,3,"didn't fit my bars as thought, not really an issue with the grips.  Although it was supposed to fit."
1210,4,Good fit on 2012 Subaru outback
1211,5,It did fit just fine on my 350z 2007
1212,5,"Fast shipping..instructions and fabrication was so easy, my wife could have done it."
1213,4,was as advertised fit well and arrived on time
1214,5,GREAT PRODUCT FIT RIGHT AS AN ORIGINAL BMW PART
1215,5,just what I needed!
1216,5,Right products
1217,5,Got my Lights last Thursday  and they are working  great so far some of the best lights actually . I can also see 10X better on the road i wouldn't  pass this product up plan on ordering  more.
1218,5,"Worked great at fraction of the cost. I was able to remove the circuit and place in new case. Note will work only if the case is broken and the internal contents are in tact. This is usually what happens to most people.  A replacement is 100 bucks or more. This is case was a very  high qualiy product, much to my surprise. I was able to carefully pop even the Honda logo and paste it with some super glue on the new case. ( just the 'H' logo is usually metal and you can carefully pry it with a fine craft knife). My wife keeps dropping her keys so I have a spare case handy just in case she cracks it again !. Usually it cracks where the key ring goes, so I also replaced the key ring with a leather loop."
1219,5,Works great
1220,5,An excellent Weight set. Every thing I needed.
1221,5,"This looks great on the back of my car!<br />compared to prices of others its a deal!<br />its a great size also. 6 inches maybe?<br /> its not to big and not to small and i plan on ordering Luna and the rest of the sailor scouts!!<br />seems durable also!only draw back there is no option for Prime, so i had to use there &#34;free shipping&#34; and that took almost a month. but its worth the buy :D"
1222,1,piece of crap rear turn signal and no brake light
1223,5,Just like home...Easy install.
1224,3,"installed kit in about 10mins. turned on headlamps and was disappointed to see headlamps not nearly as birght as the $60 HID kit I had on the car before. so let me do some math... product saids 6400 lumen, per 2 bulbs I'd assume. so at 3200 lumen each bulb. now each bulb has 2 LEDs, one on the top and one at the bottom. The top LED turns on while the bottom LED is off when the headlamps are on the lowbeam(normal driving) mode. During highbeam mode both top and bottom LEDs lit up. so at 3200 lumens per bulb/2 LEDs per bulb what you actually get is 1600 lumen per side under normal usage at night. I like LED because they take less energy/less heat and is more reliable but  for 2 times the price of the HID, I'd stick the HIDs for now."
1225,5,Few seconds to swap the boards and you're ready to go!!
1226,4,Great for and looked great!
1227,5,Good stuff.. I cant not see Not having it if u own a car/truck in NYS and do ur own repairs...
1228,5,Excellent tool
1229,4,Arrived quickly and installed easily.  Registers the oil pressure.  It is a nice quality gauge.
1230,4,There are better kits out there. But it serves its purpose well. Not bad for a one time purchase. Half the stuff in this kit I don't even use.. Just my 2cent.
1231,5,"Fits great, strong elastic to hold onto"
1232,5,"As advertised, makes installation a breeze"
1233,1,Not even 6 months old and broke that's so poor after you pay to have it installed this is not a product that should stop working this soon crazy
1234,5,"Thanks, it was the right  1, it came right on time, WILL BE<br />USING Y'LL AGAIN, THANKS A LOT"
1235,5,More then I could use but a must buy for the price.
1236,1,Not that good.
1237,5,I love this product. I would recommend Callahan parts to all my friends. Great customer service from this company.
1238,5,"We LOVE Meguiar's, The BEST Automotive Detailing Products Available Anywhere !!!!!!"
1239,5,Nice
1240,1,"Connects with my galaxy s5, but does not work with any applications including torque and obd car doc. The elm327 I bought from eBay works fine"
1241,5,excelente
1242,5,I purchased this as a gift for a friend.  Super fast shipping and exactly as described
1243,5,"I opened the boxes, I used them, and my car did not move."
1244,5,"Great performance,no purge function so keep that discharge hose as short as possible,well built..."
1245,4,"Item delivered on time, was as described."
1246,5,Really happy with purchase
1247,5,great
1248,5,nice set but i broke the phone all well its still handy to this day
1249,5,"Great hitch<br />Take the time to read instructions and install properly and you will like this hitch<br />No trailer sway, super heavy duty construction<br />As far as the noise is concerned, simply grease the sway bars where they pivot<br />And the noise goes away"
1250,5,"This regulator works great and really increases the pressure in our 5th wheel.  The shower, especially, was wonderful.  Made a world of difference.  We'll be using one from now on."
1251,4,Works as described.
1252,5,Good quality replacement for OEM.
1253,5,Great useful product!  Easy to install!  Very functional.
1254,3,Didn't know that there were no the straps or way to prevent wind from lifting them off. Otherwise ok.
1255,4,Really looks great...easy to install!
1256,2,The wires on the part you plug in were loose and so therefore I have to jiggle them to keep them on every once in awhile.
1257,5,Great item. Works great! The only thing was the directions were a little odd but explained well and it worked!
1258,4,"Does exactly what it promises, it gives you LED readouts of the circuit connections.  Using the tester, I was quickly able to determine that I needed to do some work on my vehicle's connector."
1259,5,Works perfectly! You do not need to modify anything on your helmet and the adjustment stays where you set it. Makes using the helmet very easy as opposed to the horrible strap type system many come with.
1260,5,LOVE THESE
1261,5,Suit my needs
1262,5,A great add to a great product. A must in severe duty conditions.
1263,5,This product makes my car smell delicious without headache. My favorite
1264,5,Top quality product!!
1265,4,Excellent
1266,5,"Excellent product, took about 5 minutes to install and they work great."
1267,5,Work out great just like buying from the dealership .
1268,5,"Very durable, used in camper, also have a 10 footer."
1269,5,"Bought these as a back up set. Have not used them yet, but appear to be decent for the price."
1270,5,Good price anf fit perfect.
1271,5,"I purchased this about 2 weeks ago and I got it in the mail in actually 5 days.  I love it! Its works just fine, and the are no issues thus far! This keyless entry button sales about 70-150 In stores and dealerships , so this is a complete steal!  Great product. O and programming was under $30 and free if you are a AAA good member"
1272,5,"FIne product. I use it once a week after a water rinse. On my car, that is. Keeps a nice shine -- very easy to use!"
1273,5,Did a great job on my old clouded headlight lenses. Look good as new.
1274,5,"nice fit on my 98 cherokee, 4.0L XJ"
1275,5,Exactly the right part.  Easy to install. Great fix for my truck.
1276,5,"Great gloves.  Good quality,  good fit.  I got xxl and I gave huge hands.  But snug,  bug they do not make a bigger size."
1277,5,Love it
1278,5,"The light color isn't 100% consistent, but at the price plus the savings in my outdoor lighting energy use I don't feel as though I can really complain. Light output appears to be roughly equal to the 7 watt incandescents these bulbs replaced."
1279,5,"Live free or die! =)) As a freedom lover i enjoyed representing Dr Paul while he was running... too bad he lost and there is now a village idiot with his hands on the reins ... what are we gonna do, that is the question"
1280,5,This is great stuff liked it better then Snow Seal.Will use this from now on.Great for any leather but will darken it some in color.
1281,5,Good and sheap
1282,5,"No problems at all with product, just FedEx delivered it to the wrong address."
1283,4,Perfect fit.
1284,5,Great mats.  Much better than those that came with the car.
1285,4,This piece feels very substantial. It fit right on the hitch. It was a gift for my husband and he liked it very much. I just wish there had been the option for shiny or a matte finish.
1286,1,Misleading. Didn't receive Blue Enzyme Cleaner. Received a purple/pink product.  Clearly False Advertising.
1287,4,"excellent gaerne italian quality, a bit big i would recommend to size lower"
1288,5,"Looks great, quality piece."
1289,3,its huge
1290,2,"Antenna itself seems sturdy, but adapter was too long for my jeep. I had to cut the metal adapter. Shouldn't have to do that."
1291,5,This fob was a life saver!!!! Once they were programmed all was good to go. Will order more in the future.
1292,4,Only complaint is that the back window deflectors do not curve down to stop rain if you leave the windows open a few inches.. The front deflectors are perfect..
1293,3,"A bulb either works or it doesn't. These do and the price is good.  At the rate that these type bulbs fail and considering shipping costs from other venders, it's a good idea to order a batch of 10."
1294,5,"Love these mirrors! They work great and don't shake one bit, worth the money!!!"
1295,5,great
1296,5,"I never knew what a clay bar was until I stumbled upon a chemicalguys video online. I wax regularly, but never realized there was something to take off all of that rough residue that accumulates on your paint job. What an easy process this all was and so worth it.<br /><br />I was debating whether to make my own soapy water as a clay lube but now I am glad that I went with this package. I was scared that I would scratch my black car by not using the proper lube and this clay bar and lube did an amazing job! What a difference it made.<br /><br />I also discovered another use for it. I had to peel my window tint off in a hurry a few months back and it left this horrible sticky residue that just would not come off with anything...even goo gone. I got the bright idea to spray a generous amount of clay lube on my windows, and try to scrape off with a razor blade. It came off like butter and was a 5 minute job. The lube did not allow the blade to scratch the glass whatsoever.<br /><br />Between the SUV and doing the windows I used most of the bottle of lube. Next time I would go a little easy with it but like i said I was terrified I would scratch the black paint. Between this clay bar and a quick application of a polymer wax, my car looks fabulous! Highly recommended!"
1297,5,"When this item arrived, there was absolutely NO paperwork with it. Zero, zilch!!!. Taking a cue from another reviewer, I went to YouTube and watched the instructions and took notes. Here is what I wrote down:<br /><br />1. Start w/drivers door open and unlocked.<br />2. insert key into ignition and remove it 2 times within 5 seconds.<br />3. Close and open the door 2 times.<br />4. Put key into ignition and remove it 1 time.<br />5. Close and open the door twice.<br />6. Put key into ignition and close the door, turn the key to on and then off.<br />7. Remove key.<br />8. Press lock and unlock buttons on remote together for about 2 seconds.<br />9. Press the lock button. if door locks, the remote is programmed.<br />10. Test to verify that the remote is programmed.<br /><br />Went to the car and followed these instructions and it worked like a champ. I am now a happy Toyota camper.<br /><br />Note: I almost cut this review to 3 or 4 stars due to the lack of any instructions included but left it at 5 stars just because I'm now so happy with the overall results. This little item works great.<br /><br />Update 10/27/2014:<br />Received the 2nd of these that I ordered because the first one turned out so well. Went directly from the mail box to the Camry and programmed the new remote using the above 10 steps and had it working flawlessly on the first try in less than 5 minutes. How can you beat it???"
1298,5,it was perfect fit and looks good very happy with it.
1299,1,Unfortunately this tool was made of very poor quality steel.  One of the tangs used to pull the cup rounded off during the first initial use.  Therefore it would not perform as expected. Very disappointed!  Very poor quality!
1300,3,"Didn't work for my application. They didn't work with my LED/Low power flasher i had in my '04 silverado and the other LEDs I had in it. They did light up though, just not flash or work correctly when being used with the rest of my indicators."
1301,5,"installed on a TOYOTA FunCargo (Yaris Verso), works perfect!!"
1302,1,Wrong plug on item different from oem for 2006 dts  electiricl connector is different size totally wrong very small compared to oem for car
1303,1,This does NOT fit a CRF450X. Powersports Superstore is not making it easy for me to return this item.<br />I had to cut the seat like they recommended but even then it barely fits and is super weak from being cut.<br /><br />This is terrible DO NOT BUY.
1304,5,My husband really likes this. It didn't take very long to install and so far he's very happy with it.
1305,4,Working so far.
1306,4,quality and low price
1307,3,"Skips a few crucial sizes, and the slide hammer is not a common thread size/pitch with other attachments. Maybe Kapsco sells other sizes individually, but I haven't looked."
1308,5,Bought this for my wife's car and it's a perfect fit.  Price was almost half of what it would have cost at O'Reilly's or Autozone.
1309,1,"Item did NOT work. Tried programming it several different times, replaced the battery with 2 new ones just to be safe. Has to be a short or just not working. Either way, like my marriage, I was left extremely unsatisfied.... Waste of money."
1310,5,The vent in the lid is #1. The bottle becomes &#34;spill proof&#34; when the hose is attached back to the lid for storage. Great product.
1311,5,"Great price, good service, fast delivery. The sticker looks great on my car's back window.  Thank you"
1312,5,Installing this hitch is easy!  Do not remove the splash guard underneath the rear of the car. There is access to all the bolts with the guard in place. In fact the splash guard allows for one person to install the hitch alone without a jack. Once the towing loop is removed and the muffler bracket is loose I used the splash guard to hold up the drivers side of the hitch while I put one bolt in on the muffler side. This all. Becomes apparent when you get under the car and begin installation. The entire process took me about 45 minutes
1313,3,Pretty funny stickers.
1314,5,"Looks and works like OEM, not that much $. Easy swap, one bolt."
1315,5,EVERYTHING WORKED FINE
1316,5,"It was between these and EBC's decided to go with these, because they're cheaper and I don't do enough towing without trailer brakes. Great product I live in a very cold climate and have never heard them make a sound. Highly recommended product. Great stopping capabilities. Don't forget to order hardware. These do not come with them."
1317,5,use religiously in my Audi V10. was having random misfire issues and have been completely been resolved with this product. run a dose every other tank
1318,5,"2nd time ordering from TouchUpDirect...nothing more, but nothing less than perfect touch up paint!!"
1319,5,Cute. Stuck it on my refrigerator for my husband who talks to himself constantly and is a huge fan of the King! :)
1320,5,"I can tell a difference in the increase in mph but there is a whistle noise that I was unaware of. Although this noise does not bother me. 5 stars for the price, shipping speed, and no issues with install."
1321,5,Fixed my problem and is working fine now. Easye to install and at a great price.
1322,5,WORKS ON ENGINE EXCEPT DIESELS
1323,5,Field of view is amazing.  For the price no mirror on the market can touch it.
1324,5,Great addition to CR-V .  Keeps the dogs in the back and doesn't block view from rearview mirror.  I also use as a threat to wife.
1325,5,Worked great.  No more vibration
1326,5,"My husband and his friend installed this bracket on their boat trailer.  Works like a charm.  They have fixed it so that it cannot be removed from the trailer without opening the keyed lock.  The trailer is also locked to the truck.  Now the trailer and spare won't be snatched while it is sitting at the ramp and they are off in the boat, unless they figure out how to take the truck and all, not likely!!<br />This will solve the problem of where to put the spare and the possibility of forgetting to toss it into the truck before they leave!!<br />They are both really happy with this bracket, solves so many issues."
1327,4,Great Look on the F-150!!
1328,5,A+ Fast shipping arrived on time and works great..Thank you!
1329,5,PERFECT
1330,5,"They are greet on the motorcycle, warm"
1331,4,Good decal.  It was much smaller than I had expected but was actually true to its dimensions.  Worked good.
1332,5,Great
1333,5,Doesn't miss a beat. Good fuel delevery. Easy install. Fit where the old pump went. Delevery diesel like it should have been from the factory. Never lacks when I put my foot in it.
1334,1,"Would'nt work. Had to go Penske Chevrolet, $400 later they managed to open it. Bad deal, Bought the emergency cables now."
1335,5,Works for what it was meant for.
1336,5,This product is AWESOME and so COOL!!!!! Shipping was very speedy!!
1337,3,"One of the rotors was warped and had to be turned, should have sent it back but I needed my truck."
1338,4,Just as promised
1339,5,Looks and fits great on a '97 Accord.
1340,2,I bought this item and can't even record it because the led light barely shows. Not bright at all. Maybe I'm missing something but I can barely see it at night. Product should be brighter. I see others are saying how bright they are but not on my end.
1341,3,it came with scratches on it but it does look great on the truck and I had it on in about one hour
1342,5,cute lil key chain my girl acted like a kid on Christmas morning when i surprised her with it
1343,5,Perfect size & easy to open & close
1344,5,Very fast for such a little compressor
1345,4,"nice size and placement. the sticky peel that holds it together isn't enough, though, but gorilla glue gets that done."
1346,3,"The concept is good, the light brightness is good too. However, it didn't fit into the existing socket easily. Further, I used two in my CRV and one of them, in the main dome light died in a few months. I had to put one of the extra ones."
1347,5,Actually published by husband Walt Sanders bought this at Fresno Fair in 2013 used glass cleaner on shower doors and cars works great .Then sealed glass doors with wax kept soap scum and water spots off. Used wax and glass cleaner on my cars  works great and I have used almost every wax on the market in my 50 years of caring for my cars. Stuck on driven went to the fair in 2014 to buy more
1348,4,nice product
1349,5,Fit like it was supposed to. Plenty of wire to reach battery for hook-up. Went out and hooked to a tree with 4 wheeler down hill and just hit the button and letit pull. great winch and would buy another one.
1350,5,Appears to be nice quality with a tight fit. Perfect. Can't fathom why the Volt does not come with any filter.
1351,1,"this is probably a good filter but I returned it because it doesn't fit a WIX filter holder, its twice the size so its probably for a Kenworth or big truck"
1352,5,Super cute!  Only problem is that you can barely see it on tinted windows...
1353,5,Looks good and fits great on my 2008 Outback.
1354,5,Looks great on hubbies vest!!
1355,5,"item was great, good price and fast shipping. Thanks."
1356,3,"Love these like crazy, but the driver's seat one has ripped so early on."
1357,5,I love these!
1358,3,"Tight squeeze putting it on my steering wheel. Looks good but already damaged it when exiting my vehicle with a pen in my pocket. I guess it's suppose to protect it. But once it's danaged enough, I assume I'll have to buy another one."
1359,3,Hose came out while using but otherwise very good.
1360,5,"This is a cheap straight forward damper for my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  Like some of the you tube videos my car's old rusty bolts were hard to take off.  Took some lubricant, a hammer, and a torch to loosen them up enough.  For the Jeep you indeed can only loosen the driver side bolt from the top since the bottom is welded on.  Once off I found that the driver side mounting bracket was smaller than the new steering damper (probably from years of being compressed or because the new one is slightly larger).  A tip is to put the old defective damper back in and use it to pry and expand the bracket to the correct size for the new one."
1361,2,did not meet the quality i was looking for.
1362,3,Good quality but wAs not the right size!  I trimmed it and made it work!
1363,2,"I felt very compelled to give my opinion about this Hypertech tuner.  On the one hand my expectations of the product were very high given that there has been so many great reviews from Mazdaspeed 3 owners.  On the other hand I may be slightly jaded since I own a Mazda 3 GT so I might not necessarily experience the crazy horsepower increases that the Mazdaspeed 3 may experience with this tuner.  However, is it really worth the $400 brand new?  That is very debatable.  To tell you truthfully this unit really let me down at least for this normally aspirated Mazda 3 owner.  To give some background:  I have owned my 2008 Mazda 3 GT for 6 years since new.  I have a couple of performance upgrades only.  They are:  K&N Intake and upgraded Magnaflow Catback exhaust.  Performance gains are already fairly good over stock.  No dyno, but you can definitely feel that the car is more responsive than before.  Those upgrades alone already provide for good gains, good sound, yet a very smooth intake and exhaust note.  The unit is undoubtedly very simple to update and use and return to stock if needed.  I have tested it extensively for over 1 year now.  The options for the normally aspirated Mazda 3 is definitely not the same as the Mazdaspeed 3.  There is no 0-60 throttle restriction removal which is probably the biggest let down.  I have tried the unit with both premium and regular gas and you really cannot feel any difference between the two.  The top speed limiter is adjusted to match my z-rated tires.  Again it really does not feel like anything different.  The only area where you can feel a difference is where the shift points are in the car.  When you step on the throttle with some gusto the first and second gear seem to shift a bit more aggressively than stock and it gets rid of the hesitation that it used to have between the first and second gear.  Then again I already noticed that the hesitation was diminished quite a bit already when I installed the Magnaflow catback.  I amdefinitely not noticing much of in terms of mileage gain and I do a lot of highway and some city driving.  I believe the unit does re-program some of the fuel curves on the car and definitely the shift points are more aggressive than stock.  You feel a bit more urgency when you hit the throttle and get the car's rpm's in the 3500 -4000 range, but I have tried it without the program and it really does not feel that much different in my honest opinion.  At least not $400 worth, that is for sure.  The shifting is slightly less aggressive without the program, but that's about it.  Another feature it does have is that it reads and removes OBD trouble codes.  There was one code P0891 that constantly kept being read by the unit, but it only started happening after the tune.  Something to do about the transmission control relay always on.  Removing the tune, removes the code. Go figure.  It must be something to do with the tune itself that the ECU is reading as an error code.  I would take the manufacturer's dyno testing for what it's worth because in the real world, driving conditions are never going to be the same.  I personally haven't taken it to the track, but I know for a fact that the car already performs fairly good without it.  I really can't say that it will improve upon any quarter mile track times.  I don't know really know if the manufacturer's claims of +6hp and 10 pounds of torque are true.  Under those specific testing conditions, maybe.  I don't know...maybe this unit does work way better in the Mazdaspeed 3.  Those +60hp gains and 27 pounds of torque would sound appealing to any enthusiast!  I figured if my normally aspirated Mazda 3 with some modifications can gain even a fraction of that performance I would be laughing to the bank.  However, all that I am left with after purchasing this unit are the laughs."
1364,5,"I gotta tell ya I realy didn't know what I would find when I got this jacket, BUT, WOW,!! was I ever so pleased with this jacket,I ordered<br />an xl and the fit is great, and the looks of jacket are out of this world...!! I have always wanted a motor cycle jacket, And believe me this jacket has it all, great LOOKS, FIT, and great SMELL of that wounderful leather smell !!  and last and very important ! that wicked<br />cool look....!  thankyou!<br />  JRW..."
1365,5,ok!
1366,5,Fantastis service and delivery<br />Product exactly as described<br />Highly recommended
1367,5,The Rugged Ridge hood latches work great.  They keep the bounce out of the hood on the interstate and we don't have to worry about the rubber drying out
1368,4,This plug got my rear speakers going at an affordable price.  Wires are short but give you something to hook in to.  Shipping was a little slow but I wasn't in a big hurry.  Would give 5 stars if it wasn't for these two things.
1369,5,Great price on oem filter.
1370,4,Fit was good.
1371,4,"Easy to install but I was a bit confused......it indicated that you'd need to install some snaps (came with it) onto the frame.....but that wasn't possible.  ???  Other than that, I like it and it was priced right.  Everything is there you need to install except the front windshield channel, if you don't already have one.  Check for the first....I didn't and I ordered on that I don't need. :)"
1372,5,Showed up the next day an just in time. Fit perfectly.
1373,5,Nice
1374,5,Works great in my Avalanche...what more do you want?
1375,2,Not direct fit as described. Must me wired manually
1376,4,Doing what it should without complaining
1377,5,Good product here delivered on time all the correct items in the kit<br />Kudos
1378,3,"Very pretty product, I had issues with the lenses coming apart. The Glue used doesn't hold up to the heat in Arizona."
1379,5,"This more than met my expectations.  Now I believe I have carte blanche to go after these death mongers wherever they may crawl.  This, along with a small arsenal amassed over the years gives me all the authority I need to carry out justice as I see fit.  There will be no judge, no jury, just executioner!  They claim I am the infidel?  I have news for them, this infidel now has permission to proceed with reckless abandon.  It says right on the sticker, NO BAG LIMIT, NO TAGGING REQUIRED!  I won't get the satisfaction of the trophy, UBL, but the herd still needs to be culled.  This sticker, which I purchased for less than $5, from sources unknown, gives me immense power.  Get out of my way, I will take them all down!  You too, Khorosan!"
1380,5,"Excellent quality, perfect fitment for the 2014 Kia soul. The wind noise was noticeable, but that was to be expected."
1381,4,"Looks good, went on easy lasting well. delivered on time."
1382,5,Super cute! Fast shipping!
1383,4,Ok
1384,4,will be good stocking stuffers
1385,5,fits perfectly
1386,5,Was very pleased with battery and surprised it was charged and ready to go.
1387,4,Work fine.
1388,5,Perfect tray to keep your valve train components in order when stripping down a motor. Very glad I had this when pulling apart brodix heads on a small block chevy
1389,4,very please
1390,5,OEM Perfect!
1391,4,"Right size, easy to use. It work. We are happy with it."
1392,3,"Decent kit for the money. Broke a few of the screws that came with the kit , luckily there were extras."
1393,5,Sun screen is advertised.  Fits my windshield like a glove.  Easy to roll up and store
1394,5,Adheres good. Very nice
1395,4,"Nicely covers the entire 2014 A6 windshield, except for 1/4&#34; strip along one edge depending on whether you have it pulled to the left or right a little bit.  Velcro strip to hold it closed, works pretty well - could be a little longer - 2&#34; longer would be nice to allow faster, looser rolling it up.  Really like the Audi emblem for &#34;exclusivity&#34; or pride.  Nice.  Takes up more room stowed than the simple sprung shades that can be twisted/collapsed.  Requires more room to unroll and re-roll than the sprung shades.  Similarly (not) difficult to put in place in the windshield as the sprung shades.  BUT - provides much better protection for the dash that the other types of shades.  I have a little concern that it may interfere with the pop up tweeters in either corner of the dash if I do not take care to ensure they are fully retracted or fully extended before I start fiddling with the shade.  FITS REALLY NICE."
1396,5,Excellent reception.
1397,1,There junk they smoked as soon as I installed them only work in my back-up lights never again will I get these
1398,5,Products was just what I needed
1399,5,"Great idea, great price, works great."
1400,4,"it worked, but not a perfect fit. wish i could have just purchased the one. Price was right."
1401,3,"Seems to be manufactured fairly decent for a low cost item that sit around and collects dust most f the time for the part time hobbiest. Used it to tear down a few small blocks, and it functioned perfectly with no issues."
1402,3,"First, the cons:<br />1) They're a little small, and I had to shim them with thin strips of wood between the tabs that hold them in place and the body of the headlight, as well as underneath the headlight assemblies atop the bumper.<br />2) You have to remember that the Mustang is built as a two headlight system, not four, so either the bright beam OR the standard beam will be on, but NOT both at the same time when you hit the brights, unless you want to tamper with your car's wiring.  So, it was a bit tricky adjusting these, as the brights are permanently aimed up higher than the standard beams.<br />3) Projection headlights like these have  finite cutoff at the top of their light field,  unlike the OEM ones that throw light everywhere. Adjust them accordingly, or you will find overhead signs unreadable, but not too high, or your highbeams will light up the trees. I found the best way to adjust them is to start with the way they recommend on a wall, then find a dark place with little traffic and drive and adjust til you're happy.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) I didn't seal them with sealant - the instructions don't tell you to, and I decided I would not until and unless I saw a problem with condensation. Good news, I haven't had a problem, and I have driven them through buckets of downpours, car washes, and had them on during wide temperature swings day to night.<br />2) Bright light with the factory bulbs that is nice and clear.  In fact, occasionally, I get flashed for having brights on when I don't. Please note I did NOT try installing a HD light system, which I don't believe would fit these.<br /><br />So overall, for the price, and with some work, these do the job."
1403,5,its a spark plug! spark spark spark!
1404,5,"Pros:  They work as advertised.  They have no problem matching the brightness of stock incandescent bulbs.  Since these worked well, I plan to replace the rest of my car's exterior lights with LEDs.<br /><br />Cons: JDM Astar, and most other manufacturers for that matter, do not offer LED replacements for cars with CK sockets - such as my Rav4.  Rather than spend double this price for the one product that does fit, I took the DIY route.  With the help of a multimeter and following the CK and standard socket diagrams, I bent the contacts around to the proper position and got them to work without shorting any fuses.<br /><br />Buy these and never have to worry about your blinkers again."
1405,5,ok
1406,5,"Bought this for a 12 hour drive from PA to SC for vacation.  The amount of extra cargo space this bag grated was a life saver.  I was able to put 2 beach chairs, a jogging stroller, beach toys, the bag of beach towels and life vests, and had room to spare for small odds and ends.  I also purchased the Sherpak SuperMat Roof Mat (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0024QF4GI/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_4) on the recommendation of another reviewer of this product and it worked out great.  I probably could have used some towels or an old sheet but I felt like the mat just gave it some extra padding.  The bag worked great we drove through rain storms on the way there and the way home and the bag was bone dry at each destination.  The flaps over the zippers seemed to work really well at keeping things dry.  It fit perfectly between the roof rack bars on my 2011 Durango which was nice.  The fact that I could remove the plastic parts to the strap let me loop the straps though the cargo tie downs very easily.  My advice to to just make sure you wrap the excess parts of the strap up so they don't flap in the wind and drive you nuts.  I forgot to do that to one strap on the way home and was driven crazy until the first bathroom break. :-)"
1407,5,"This is just what I was waiting for! This is the perfect product to clean the interior of your car. I have leather seats in my car in which I have been using a leather cleaner; however, there are many interior areas that are plastic such as the dashboard and the steering wheel, just to name a couple, in which I always wondered which product would be better to use, a leather cleaning product or a window cleaning product? This product fits the bill! What I also like about this product is the fact that it doesn't make your dashboard shiny and it's also great for the steering wheel since it doesn't make it slippery, they're both safety features. I have used other products in the past in which they actually made the windshield shiny (not good if you're trying to drive) and the steering wheel slippery; but I have to emphasize, that is not the case with this product. It cleans pretty good too!"
1408,4,I really like the tank but the clamp has a plastic handle which lasted till I used it about three times. Otherwise good product.
1409,4,"The Charger does what it claims. Only thing is that it does take a long time for the type of battery that I have. I probably used have gotten something with a little more current output, as this only puts out approx 1A of current. I guess you get what you pay for."
1410,5,ok
1411,4,"This whole zombie thing is weird.  This sticker looks official and is funny, and was cheap."
1412,5,floor mats fit great.  glad we bought them as soon as we purchased the van because there is already grass and dirt all over them.  when winter comes they will be a mess.  much better than having the carpets in.
1413,2,An electronic flasher is a MUCH better solution.  Load resistors and these decoders are silly.  Try this:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/3-Pin-CF-13-Electronic-Flasher-Signal/dp/B008C9YJ6C/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1410640900&sr=8-2&keywords=electronic+flasher<br /><br />Or one like it that fits your particular car.
1414,5,Great product!
1415,5,"What Can I say,you have been, searching but look no more, these priced to sell quick, very nice shine and everything you need to mount these on that Big Ford are also packaged with shipment, replace them old dinged up simulators with a fresh set,so you can let your truck look good again"
1416,3,Not what I expected but that's mu fault for not reading. I don't like the fact that they were $11 when I ordered them 50 days ago and now they're only $6.
1417,5,Perfect fit
1418,3,Kind out on this one....<br />U either like or u don't....
1419,5,perfect
1420,1,No good
1421,4,JUST RECEIVED SO NOT MUCH TIME TO TRY
1422,5,Was just as described
1423,5,"Repuesto 100 % original, completamente nuevo"
1424,5,It is a good product. In fact it is that  I was waiting for.<br />Thanks
1425,4,"I bought this stuff to protect the paint job I did on my motorcycle with spray paint. It did exactly that while giving me a nice gloss finish. With a bit of wet sanding and polishing I got a really nice finish. I have spilled gas on my tank numerous times but no affect since this is the 2k clear. This product is great for someone who doesn't have a paint gun setup.<br /><br />Pros- Get the right protection out of a spray can, Leaves a nice gloss look, Doesn't require paint gun setup<br /><br />Cons- The low pressure leaves orange peel and causes extra work to wet sand, polish and buff out, a bit on the expensive side ( I used 4 cans), have to use within 24 hours before it hardens after mixed (be ready to spray the entire can)<br /><br />Even though I have listed more cons than pros. It is a great alternative and I would recommend this product for anyone who plans to paint once or twice and needs a small amount of clear coat. Any more than that it will save you in the long run to buy a cheaper paint gun setup and you will save money in the long run. I probably will not buy it again simply because of the price and I have acquired myself a paint gun."
1426,4,A good quality product fits great on my 07 1098
1427,1,Wrong items
1428,5,"Awesome product, easy to put on and off. Can be easily seen in both night and day driving times. Lets people know who is behind the wheel and this has been a huge blessing, cuts down on the stress of the driver and the required driver's license Passenger because people on the road seem to respect and give courtesy with the understanding what is going with the vehicle that is being driven. Ah what a relief, highly recommend this product for anyone that will have someone that is learning to drive or who is still new to driving no matter what their age is. Note that this product is not super thick but thick enough, so if you live in a hot climate ensure that you lay the magnetics completely flat during storage to not wrinkle/bend them. Also, these magnetics has held up during the rain."
1429,5,Great item. I recommend these sunglasses.
1430,1,Seems to pretty much be a waste of my money.  These don't work.  See critters walking calmly all around them.
1431,1,It looks cool and everything but it keeps coming apart
1432,5,Excellent
1433,5,Works well on steel belted motorcycle<br />Tires despite the warning leaking only about 2psi in a week under normal driving conditions and speeds
1434,5,best smell ever! I actually don't where deodorant I just tie these guys under my arms and I'm good to go.
1435,5,"This is a great code reader at a great price.  It reads codes accurately; however, some codes may have multiple causes so you'll still have to do some detective work to identify the cause code.  If you want a reader that gives more specific code readings you will have to pay a lot more money.  All in all very happy with this purchase."
1436,5,The Leather Conditioner worked really well on our couch.  The surface scratches are minimalized.  The conditioner left the leather couch supple and with a nice sheen.  The couch almost looks as when we had bought it.  Minimal fragrance.
1437,5,"This was a non-Amazon purchase. The reason I am giving it 3 stars is that the three times I have used it in the past week to keep a tire properly inflated (due to a road hazard while the replacement was being sent) I had to replace the 20amp fuse twice.    First time, it worked out of the box. Two days later when I plugged it, I could hear a hissing sound as if air was flowing even though I hadn't connected it to the battery yet.It wasn't a momentary air leak from the tire as I screwed in the brass plug. As soon as I turned it on, the fuse blew. Replaced and tried again and it worked fine. Three days later, same thing. This time however I did not hear any air hiss.    I will try it a couple of times more this week to see if the issue is with the unit. Anyone else seen this!!!!    BTW the compressor works fantastic.Teh sound is well damped and it fills air pretty fast. The airpressure monitor on teh unit is a bit off but I always check with a digital gaugs so bo biggie. Other than the issue reporrted, I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is contemplating a portable air compressor    Edit (02/12/2015):  I have since used this on quite a few occasions and it has served well. In one case, helped a bud to get their Van with a flat to the repair shop from I-95. Very fast and efficient. Updated the review to 5 stars"
1438,5,"Yep, that's what I needed! Fits the standard drain outlet on my camper perfectly."
1439,5,Good price and gives me the jump I need. It also works good to scare your teenagers with some good old fashioned torture when they won't do their homework.
1440,5,I purchased these mirrors and some thread adapters to use on my mobility scooter as they are much better than the ones sold for the scooter. They work great and have give a better rear view.
1441,4,"Fits my 2013 Toyota Venza just fine. As some have stated, there are not as many pleats as the original. However, I change the filter regularly, so this is a good enough quality for the price. If you don't replace it regularly, you may want to opt for something else."
1442,5,"There was a hole in my crv ceiling where the original visor clip was. I bought these. You just insert, twist, and you're good as new!"
1443,5,"Excellent products.  The only problem is, out of 6, 1 is not working.  The lights are as bright as seen on TV ad."
1444,5,"super  quality goods  ​​ I did on  armsan phenoma carbo,,,,super,,,"
1445,5,Matches my other headlight exactly except it's nice and new! (I have an '06 Cobalt Coupe)
1446,5,Love it I got a 2014 Jeep and didn't want to advertise for the dealer it looks good
1447,4,"I already have a dandy 12 volt charger so this one is only to charge my 6 volt motorcycle batteries. On the two I tried, it worked fine. Maybe it won't last but it's a simple enough device. If you don't have a battery charger at all, for $35-$45 you can buy a charger that does 6 and 12 volt perfectly and will last almost forever."
1448,1,I owned a pair of these gloves before and left them at the job. They came up missing. I found them on amazon and had to order a pair. I got them and within a week the the thread on two of the fingers came apart. Not cool at all. And because I threw out the receipt and box couldnt return them.
1449,5,"product was shipped on time, was well packaged and was of the quality I as expecting. I will definitely do more business with these people in the future! and recommend them to others."
1450,4,"It fit, worked well and holds the glass up very well.  The only complaint I can make about it is there is not really a left and right piece.  That means on one side you will have to rotate the connecting head in order to make it fit.  Not necessarily a huge issue, but if you turn the wrong piece you will probably damage it and may even break it completely.  I only mention this because sometimes people aren't comfortable trying to install things like this themselves although it is pretty easy except for that one thing.<br /><br />I might suggest searching for a Youtube video of someone installing one or something if you feel uncertain about what to turn or how to turn it.  It works well though and is a pretty easy item to install."
1451,5,Worked great keeps engine cool! Stays on great if you use the hardware right!
1452,5,"Plasti-Dipped my 900RR, love this stuff."
1453,2,There ok they eventually fall out by there so thin the clips fall apart they look nice but there cheap and it took a whole month to recipe them
1454,4,Work good 👍
1455,5,"I'm happy with the remote and was easy to program, thank you sal nasonte"
1456,5,Work like à charm
1457,5,"This is an excellent polisher.  Started with a cheap Porter Cable, then got a Griots Garage.  This is my go to polisher and removes paint defects so well.  My other polishers are downgraded to headlight restoration and sealant/wax applicators."
1458,5,perfect
1459,5,These are great and have already lasted over a year!
1460,4,Did read where with door's on hard to see rightside mirror bit is great with doors off
1461,4,works
1462,5,I'm very satisfied with my purchase. It looks exactly like the picture and super cute expcially on my car!!
1463,5,Yes they fity dad's cars perfect
1464,5,"My original bumper cover had been damaged and repaired 3 times before I decided to replace it. When I determined that I could replace it with an aftermarket copy for less than $100. delivered, I jumped at the chance. I had to remove the grill and fog lamps from to old bumper cover. The whole replacement operation, including painting the new cover took about two hours. I am very pleased with the results."
1465,5,All of the Mechanix gloves are great!
1466,4,Works great on my 5th wheel.
1467,4,"Installed in my 2005 Subaru Baja in less than an hour, fit good, works fine.  Didn't come with fan bolts, the bolt holes on this are different than the self tapping screws used on the stock plastic radiator."
1468,1,It did not fit my Jeep Liberty as the advertisement said it would. Idont know how to return it. My Husband was so happy I brought him covers in his favorite color but now it stays in box.
1469,1,"energy suspension needs to be more specific about applications that this product is correct for . It did not fit my 1999 mk4 jetta . I had to return it . Before buying you need to get under the car and really see what hardware you have ! VW is notorious for changing parts configuration within a production run . One 1999 mk jetta GLS , AEG engine , 5 speed may not have the same setup as another identical car ."
1470,5,"works great, program was easy."
1471,5,"I bought this for our 1999 Jeep Cherokee (XJ).  It looks nice, and will prevent me from opening the cap when it's too hot.  Great idea."
1472,5,Exactly what I was looking for in regards to my 2005 Dodge Ram Quad Cab!!!!
1473,4,get fir worked great
1474,5,Works great!
1475,4,"This product is awesome. Red is red not pink like some anodized parts may look. Great addition to my Zx10r special edition. I only give 4 stars because the items described and pictures are slightly different than those sent. Can't wait to get the red anodized motor bolt kit next. I already had the coolest Zx10r in PA, now I've set myself apart from the rest."
1476,3,I had the sew the one of the sleeves back together after 1 wearing.
1477,5,"Ok so ive had this intake for aprox 1 year. Love it. it arrived in a timely fashion and the day i got it i took the night installing it in the dark cause i wanted it ASAP. Took about 2 hours because i had to find someone with smaller hands to get down to the turbo outlet and remove the old cupler.<br />Since having it for a year, i get some power increase, nothing really noticable, you wont notice alot of power increases unless you get your car tuned. I got my 07 GTI stage 2 Revo tuned shortly after and feel large pwer increase and boost up to 24LBs. But anways, back to this intake. better throttle response and a short turbo spool time. As of sound, its not the turbo you hear when you accelerate, its the intake sucking in air, so all these review saying that you hear the turbo when you rev at like 2k is a liar, MKv FSI turbo will not spool until you hit around 3.5K. But the Sound of the air being sucked in and pushed out of your Diverter Valve is AMAZING. very noticable and very aggressive sounding driving around.<br />All and all Better gas milage, and better response. Now you just need to use VAG Com and change your Air to Fuel Ratio and boost your PSI levels. Good luck."
1478,5,Fits perfectly. Easy to change out.
1479,1,"Only the case without any divice in it<br />I order more then 1 , what a waste of money"
1480,5,"Very affordable, no problems fits well on my 2005 Chevy Tahoe...excited because other places where very expensive...Thank you so very much definitely will buy again"
1481,1,They broke wile i was installing them the welds are not good
1482,5,Fit perfect
1483,5,Worked great
1484,5,"These LED bulbs are bright I like how they make the interior of my '98 Avalon look so much brighter than before and they fit really well in the dome light. I also like the color of it it's like a 6500k color that looks really nice. Unfortunately I tried to put one of these in the trunk but ended up bending the contacts of the bulb because it wouldn't fit so I had to throw it away, otherwise great product. Would recommend to people that want some LEDs, and also great price compared to a certain site that specializes in selling bright led bulbs. :D"
1485,3,Could be better
1486,1,"I just spent 2 hours trying to install this POS!!  After getting everything ready, the hitch holes do not match the frame.  The back holes are off by 1 3/4\\"", not even close.  I can't imagine all the 5 star reviews, because this company obviously has no quality control at all.  Probably some Six Sigma black belts sitting around a campfire.  This \\""Made in the USA\\"" pile of crap should never have made it out of the factory.  Yes, it is stout, and yes it has nice powder coating.  But if it doesn't fit..........  I will never buy from this outfit, and will tell anybody who will listen not to buy from them as well.  And yes, I am not happy."
1487,5,Work great! I really feel it is helpful when people know you have a student driver.
1488,5,"well designed ,quick ship.keeps the kit  all in one place"
1489,4,"Can't beat the polish. It does an amazing job and it doesn't take much to do it. I bought the 250 gram tin, because I use it frequently. But, the top to the canister is thin and with repeated openings and closings it may not hold up. But, so far, so good. Good stuff!!!"
1490,5,"Item was refurbished and can't tell the difference between it and a new one, great shape! As performance goes it is outstanding it makes the 4.7 scream! wished I would have purchased sooner! Received it faster than promise date and very easy to install. Great product and recommend to purchase. Superchips tech emailed performance specs..... 87oct 46hp 51tq, 91oct 50hp 55tq, and 93oct 61hp 66tq. It does what is says, great seller as well."
1491,5,Haven;t used yet but it appears to be very high quality.
1492,5,"Great product, No problems since being installed."
1493,5,"Best thing for my aging father. Easy install, worked as promised. Clear picture for my 83 yr old dad to use even in semi direct daylight"
1494,5,Great to deal with nice quality
1495,5,Look great on car
1496,1,the battery I received was a lemon as it apparently had a bad connecter on it.  The Phone wouldn't charge and finally died when the battery fully discharged.  The battery percentage indicator never changed at 87%.  Once it died it would continually reboot at the Apple logo when plugged in and never fully boot up.<br />I ordered another cheaper battery from another Amazon vendor and my phone is back as good as new.
1497,4,"It's a charger with alligator clip connectors. I would gave it 5star had it have a led light to indicate if it was on or charging. You get what you pay for, it works. I had it for 3 weeks and it's still ticking. If you're on a budget, this is for you. If you can affordto spend alittle more, go find something with a charging indicator."
1498,5,My son absolutely loved the decal and though a bit tricky to get off adhesive and onto truck - well worth the effort.
1499,5,Perfect
1500,5,"As described, very sturdy will last years."
1501,5,"Pretty damn nice to have wipers again.<br /><br />Works great, installs easy."
1502,4,Nice lights
1503,3,Doesn't work as expected
1504,5,"these filters work great on old triumph motorcycles ,they fit between the barrels and carbs perfect i use this type on all my brit bikes"
1505,5,"ships fast, super bright light, relay has to be installed on the 06 m109r"
1506,5,"I researched this product like crazy all over the internet trying to look for reviews from YouTube and others not from the Washdrops webpage, but came across very little. So I like many other people I knew were very skeptical about whether or not this solution would actually work in cleaning a car with 3 capfuls of the liquid and a gallon of water. So I recently purchased it from the Washdrops website.<br /><br />It actually worked. I was caught off guard with how well this could clean a whole car. My skepticism regarding whether it would leave streaks or would scratch the paint of my car with the dirt particles rubbing all around were proven otherwise. No streaks, no scratches, just a clean glow on the car.<br /><br />Also, since California isn't in the best of water conditions right now, this really helps with being a solution for those who need a clean car in these extreme drought situations.<br /><br />So overall, a phenomenal product. I would highly recommend for the skeptics out there to try and for those in extreme droughts (California!). Will definitely buy the gallon sized one next."
1507,4,easy to install.  Best to have a second person.  Works perfect.
1508,5,So far these seem to be a good pad. Only time will tell.
1509,1,The wrong part completely! Waste of time and money.
1510,5,"These mats are heavy duty. They cover a lot of floor space.  They are also very easy to clean, just hose off with water (outside of the truck, of course)  They appear to be very durable.  After much in and out of a work truck there has been absolutely no problems."
1511,5,Gotta love anything &#34;union American&#34;! Great hard hat stickers!
1512,5,Replaced a PD9160 I had for over 10 Years.  The PD9270 was easy to install and it works as advertised.
1513,1,"Bright white...looks great., but one must have a short as it keeps going out unless I plug it in a certain way and hope it stays put. Won't buy from them again."
1514,4,Works great.  Had to replace the double sided tape so that it would stay in place.
1515,5,"This is a great sun shade for the Hyundai elantra 2011-2013. The custom fit and heat protection is excellent! The only downside is that it's not compact when trying to put it away, but other than that it's a great product. Highly recommend!"
1516,5,Nice
1517,5,"great buy great price, worked great for our 83 bmw"
1518,5,Awesome price for OEM part!
1519,5,what i wanted great thanks billyb
1520,5,Very good fit
1521,1,I charged the unit up and tried to jump start my motor cycle and the wires on the unit got hot and started smoking..
1522,5,These work awesome to make homemade landscape lighting out of harbor freight metal funnels.  Home Depot can keep their expensive plastic garbage.
1523,5,Great for our rv
1524,5,"Solid product that feels like oem. Unfortunately, this DOES NOT FIT W203 1999-2009 Class. I returned it, zero issues."
1525,5,Looks factory!
1526,5,"great product, fits perfectly, never collapsed, not even after a several days on the sun, I am very happy with this product"
1527,5,Great Filter from K & N....  Save money by installing one of these. They have a little more up front cost in the long run you will re-coup your money .  This increased my MPG about 2 and really woke up my Cumming Diesel.
1528,5,It fits and its says Honda. Glad I found it.
1529,5,perfect fit
1530,4,"The back seat covers were too big, we made it fit over all i like the design and everything else was okay however they didn't come with any directions"
1531,3,"This is for the entire unit not just the motor and gear reduction box. The shaft in the motor will not let you interchange it onto a traditional lance slide in camper jack unit. My mistake by not doing my hework before ordering. The unit itself looks fine and should work well for what it is suppossed to be used on, just not a lance slide in truck camper that happens to have the same motor part number."
1532,5,Awesome product!! Fast shipping!
1533,1,"At first these looked like a really good product. However, when I got it and tried to put 4 tires with rims inside, they didn't fit. I don't see how the description to this product can state that this bag can hold up to 4- 27&#34; tires when I can't even get 4- 18&#34; tires in them!"
1534,4,Very good looking exhaust tip
1535,1,Fake! What a waste!
1536,4,"White light to match my fogs and my \\""DRL\\"" signals, but not as bright perceptually as the yellow halogens. The light from these is easily washed out by street lamps. On a dark road there seems to be less light perceptually but you can still see the road fine. I particularly like the fact that they do not feed back much light from road signs. On my GL1800 Gold Wing there was always too much glare from road signs for me to see the stuff on the road itself (like raccoons or road kill). This was especially bad with the new style reflective signs that employ.the checkered prism background. With these bulbs the signs just glow and are easily seen and pleasant but that nasty glare is gone so you can see your surroundings as well. That fact alone makes me happy with these bulbs. However, if you are expecting brighter you may not like them. See my picture of these compared with yellow halogen.<br /><br />My picture did not show up so don't look for it."
1537,5,"Does the job.  Had to replace a OEM side mirror for my 2002 Camry after a small accident with an overhead parking post.  Who's laughing now immobile object?  Well, the post still is because the mirror looks pretty ugly when the rest of the car is maroon.  But once I get a driver's side mirror in black to match, then it won't be too bad.  A cinch to install, even though I never replaced one before.  Youtube it and be done.  Much better than spending $300 for parts and labor at my local Toyota dealer."
1538,5,Fits like a glove and is very sturdy. Highly recommend.
1539,5,Excellent.  When you need them.....these work well and fit properly.
1540,1,Perfect fit on my 2008 Honda Element.  Cured my &#34;clunking&#34; issue when accelerating.  Nearly 8K miles since install and still going strong!<br /><br />UPDATE:  Barely made it a year before the rubber completely broke apart inside this mount!  Terrible quality when you consider the factory mount lasted 6 years and over 100K miles!  Spend a little more and buy OEM Honda or risk having to replace other mounts when this one fails.  Buyer beware!
1541,5,"The actual size is 25.5&#34;, fits 2002 E320"
1542,5,"Work Great, The &#34; Check Engine light is off Now&#34;......"
1543,3,"These are only half useful. The cap with the nubs fits the Rhino hose, the other is useless. I was looking for the same caps that come with the Rhino Hose extensions. I want to close each section for storage."
1544,5,Fast shipping. Just as advertised!!
1545,5,"Just what I wanted!  I use a lanyard on my camera and really love being able to detach a small portion when I have it around my neck.  Being a MINI lover, I was thrilled to find this!  Just what I wanted, good quality, great price.  Happy, happy!!"
1546,5,WORKS GREAT
1547,4,"easy to install, however the small very fine thread screws are difficult to insert in the air dam connections"
1548,5,great for the 4-wheeler!
1549,5,direct bolt on works great very happy with it
1550,1,BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!! Why didn't I listen to the others??????? This lighter is TOO big for American made vehicles. It just does not fit the lighter port. What a waste of money! NEVER AGAIN
1551,5,Good quality component and much better than the stock item.
1552,5,This is exactly what I needed for my 2.5l '98 Wrangler. Perfect fit and had no problems putting it in.
1553,5,It fit and worked on my 2000 ML55 AMG front end
1554,1,Picture shows WIX filter and what I got was a case of 12 Auto Extra filters.
1555,2,Takes alot of work to clean glass and most outcome are smeary or cloudy.
1556,4,the relay is not quite as the picture shows it there is no screw mounting bracket. It seems to work well
1557,5,The best filter for the money for your Cummins.
1558,1,"Can anyone tell me how to open the Hood latch, once this grill is installed?"
1559,5,I love these!  So much better than the ones sold by Honda.  Arrived very quickly!
1560,5,Replacement part for my boat.  I bought 2.
1561,5,I recently purchased this seat cover to replace an old one on a 1982 Honda Nighthawk. The seat cover pictured is a different style then the one they shipped. I am still pleased with the design of the actual one they shipped. Perhaps they could update their picture. Very good quality and it turned out really well. I would urge you to take your time during the installation process. Perfection takes time. My seat looks brand new.
1562,5,"This replaced stock rotors, fit great ,stop quicker, also look nice so far no rust on rotors ,very happy."
1563,5,Works very well.
1564,5,It fits my 2014 Highlander & seem to be well constructed.
1565,5,This s***s the bomb
1566,5,look good. not bad on price.
1567,5,Works great super fast shipping
1568,5,"Perfect, but I expected nothing less from Hopkins."
1569,5,"If mounting driving or fog lights these brackets are a must and avoid the cheaper ones as they will not hold the lights steady and on the bars properly. Don't skimp on the mounting brackets for lights. Save a few bucks on cheaper ones and you will likely be disappointed like I was and end up changing them out for these. Driving down the road with the lights bouncing and then they won't stay adjusted is frustrating. But not with these, I have them on a Semi  deer rack and it vibrates and bounces all the time and the lights never move adjustment. Worth every dime and with Prime, they showed up right on time. Easy install, make sure you put the rubber strips against the bar you are mounting them on, strips come with brackets. Thanks!"
1570,5,Excellent
1571,5,"Installed it on my '06 Chevy Cobalt. No issues. Don't know about the installation process, though."
1572,5,Easy to install. Looks great!
1573,5,Very good product. Easy to install and has smooth ride.
1574,5,"Can't complain about anything. The price is good, the product fits my 2010 mazda 6 perfectly. The filter is in my car for 2 days now and the AC works fine. If I went to the dealers or a auto service, it would cost me 60-100 dollars."
1575,5,"Just as expected slight power gain, turned off AFM  and adjusted for tire size."
1576,5,I was skeptical at first but this thing really works . Now if it only had better straps than the flimsy elastic things that it comes with.
1577,5,Fit perfectly.
1578,5,"Installed on corolla 1995, working good."
1579,5,Good product
1580,4,"Quick shipment, very easy to install!"
1581,5,Great product for my Yamaha 150
1582,5,Well built frame that should last my lifetime.Money well spent.
1583,4,"Thanks for the prompt service the tail lamp looks & Fits the car good ,<br />However the tail lamp 7 turn lamp sockets provided did not lock to my body wiring harness,<br />I removed the sockets & used the ones that came with my car.<br />All's well that ends well"
1584,5,Just as expected.  Worked well on my motorcycle.
1585,5,"Save your fuel, turn off your A/C. For the price, these can't be beat.<br />Clean the surface before adhering and they'll last for years.<br /><br />They fit our 2004 Nissan Sentra Spec-V perfectly. The only complaint I have is since these stick onto the outside of your door and not in the window channel, you sacrifice a little distance down you can lower your window. Not really an issue though since cracking the window even an inch brings a good amount of breeze."
1586,5,Fit perfectly!
1587,1,"I am extremely unhappy with this product. I purchased this to place near the keyboard on my laptop. On the envelope it came in, on the front it says to visit its website for application instructions. Obviously, I thought it was a whole sticker that you just place onto whatever. So, I proceeded to take top of the sticker off, which i thought was just to protect the sticker in shipping, and found, the the vinyl is multiple pieces. I thought I would have to pick each piece off and place it separately in the spot, but it is impossible to get it exactly right without having it look uneven. I don't understand why I have to go directly to the website in order to understand how to properly apply it, instead of just providing the instructions inside the envelope. I couldn't replace the stickers on the thing in order to start over, so now it is useless. Why couldn't the company just put it on one sticker that you just peel and place instead of this complicated mess. WIll not be buying from this company again."
1588,2,"The covers look far better in photos than in person. Very cheap looking but would do the job if you have an old car or cant afford better.  They didnt fit the Tacoma seats well. However, the seller was very efficient and fast with shipping. If the quslity was better with the product, I would buy from this seller again."
1589,5,works great great price!
1590,5,Very good product.
1591,5,"I received these yesterday and installed them on my 2013 JK immediately.  It took about 30 minutes to install the 20 bolts.  The only tools required were a 13mm socket, a 10mm wrench, and a 4mm allen wrench (included).  The brackets were stamped indicating which side and front or rear and were wrapped in color coded plastic.  Instructions were easy to follow.  Taking the time to separate out the hardware was a real time saver.  The wrinkle black finish looks food with the black fender flares.  Reasonably priced and a great addition to the Jeep."
1592,5,"used on back ,very nice"
1593,5,Best I've ever had
1594,5,Good grip and low noise brake pad.
1595,5,Did not reach me
1596,5,"Perfect OE replacement for 97' Silverado.  Replaced compressor with a Delphi CS0120, AC Delco condenser orifice tube 15-5378, and this accumulator/drier assembly and everything fit and works great."
1597,5,Exactly what I was Looking for
1598,5,Perfect fit for our MDX at a fraction of the cost.
1599,5,I returned these because I did not need them but they were recommended by a friend who says they work good.
1600,5,Perfect for Thermal Arc 186 TIG welder. Rolls great! Easy to assemble.
1601,5,great in ohio look good yet
1602,5,"Works great, seems like good quality."
1603,5,Exact fit and OEM part! Excellent price for a factory part! Works great!!
1604,5,Works as advertised.  Easy to install and hood stays up. on the ES300.
1605,4,"Bought it for my 05 S2000 after receiving a no front plate ticket and came quickly in the mail. Didn't like the fact that it didn't have a description of how to install it but it was simple and common sense lol. Looks great, on the car, made of good quality and is definitely better looking then a front plate ticket."
1606,1,I bought this set of stem caps because one of my regular chrome caps randomly went missing and these matched my LeSabre great. I was very pleased with my purchase until I washed my car today and saw the Buick &#34;Sticker&#34; was missing from one of the Stem Caps. For the price I paid I expect better quality than this.
1607,5,Outstanding price.<br />Great lights.<br /><br />Fantastic Ventor!!
1608,1,"Ordered this fitting, along with 4 other ABS fittings to install a new holding tank in my camper this weekend.  Received these items very quickly as always when ordering from Amazon, but upon inspection of these fittings I found that 4 out of 5 of these have cracks all the way through plastic, and I'm not talking about the molded seams that are visible in some fittings. In the case of this flange, the plastic is cracked all of the way through on all 8 mounting holes to the outside, which I could have used it this way, but there is also a crack from top to bottom, all the way through the threads to the outside,  and continues through the land where the toilet seal sits.  This will leak for sure.  Currently looking into sending all of these back."
1609,5,Great tool and very inexpensive. I paid $16.66 without sales tax so i am pleased. It does everything i need it to do and its accurate and I recommend it.
1610,2,I believed it was a decal that i would pit on the inside car window showing outward  disappointed.
1611,5,Have Used Mothers protectant for years and love it. Does a great job and I like the smell. Have had numerous people make comments how our 2011 CRV looks and smells brand new still!!
1612,5,Such an awesome protective item for my alarm fob!<br />I will always have these on my alarm fobs!
1613,5,great
1614,2,"My EZ Pass transponder fits in the holder, but the first time I used it the light at the toll booth wouldn't turn green. I took the transponder out of the holder, and the scanner then read it and the light turned green. I put the transponder back in the holder, and at the next toll booth the transponder was read without a problem; however, the next toll booth didn't read it. I decided to keep the transponder out of the holder for the rest of the trip and had no further problems."
1615,4,Very nice quality mirrors for a fraction of the cost at the Polaris dealer. Nice that they can fold in. Ours was missing a screw so we had to make do but so far very pleased.  Easy to mount to our Ranger Crew.
1616,5,"mechanic would charge 80.00 dls to fix this problem, bougth this relay, replaced myself.<br />saved about 70 dls."
1617,1,Floor mats never arrived. The quality of the seat covers is really poor. They're cheap and thin. The backseat cover didn't fit either.
1618,5,"Love the fit on my Civic. The package comes in a roll, leave it out in the sun for a while so it will take its natural form then install. It catches all the dirt. Bit thin but will do."
1619,3,I actually bought 8 but broke one putting it in. I have put 500 miles on the plugs and dont see any improvement in mileage or power. I am still going to give it a bit more time before I say anything bad about these plugs.
1620,5,Pretty cool stuff.
1621,3,"Good for the price, but the plastic is not very durable.  The plastic mounting points broke and I had to epoxy them back, twice."
1622,5,"good buy, thanks"
1623,5,Fits my 725CFM CobraJet cab perfectly
1624,1,This is a stick on and not sure I will use.
1625,1,"I would not recommend this refurbished alternator to anyone unless you have a support vehicle to tag along . My 40AMP factory alternator has 120,000 miles on it and it's plum wore out .. I installed this 85AMP and didn't get 2 miles away from home before it started making a rattling noise .. I made it back home ok , I took it back off my bike . The front pulley nut was loose and as I was turn the damn thing by hand it was trying to lock up on me making a scraping noise from the inside .. I contacted LActrical and they told me that the factory where the alternator was assembled must have left it loose .. Then they said that they only took the back cover off to do the upgrade were if would change 85AMPS ..This told me being a ASE certified mechanic for 35 years that they are full of shit and didn't know what they were talking about .. I'll never buy anything from LActrical again and that's FO DAMN SHO !!!"
1626,5,PERFECT FIT ....ITIS WORKING FINE AND FIT MY KIA 1997  WITH NO PROBLEMS.....TO ABLE TO INSTALLED IT  DUE THAT THE KIS IS TIGHT TO WORK  I HAVE TO CUT THE TOP PART OF THE OLD ONE WITH HACK SAW TO FIT  SPECIAL LIKE SPARK PLUG CUBE TO LOOSE THE TOP NUT WITHOUT STRIIPING IT BUT TO FIT THE NEW HOSE  AT BOTTOM WAS EASY  NO MORE  LEAKS  ......GOOD PRODUCT ........THANKS
1627,5,"Excellent product, better than the Car Manufacturer all weather mats."
1628,5,great quailty
1629,3,Pricey part.
1630,5,"Really Good Product, I like it!"
1631,1,The clips do not properly for my 09 legacy.  They are size or two too big.
1632,4,Size is length also. they were a bit long.
1633,4,"I'm not sure how much good it did, but it was easy to use."
1634,5,Good Product
1635,5,Jacket is great.  Haven't worn it yet so don't know how it will be in the cold but fits and looks great.  Totally happy with it!!
1636,5,"This is my second Fumoto valve. Although time is added when draining the oil, the less mess and cleanup is entirely worth it. When attached with a hose, I simply route it into a jug and open the valve. Once it gets close to capacity I will switch containers. I no longer go through multiple shop rags full of oil, clean out my pan, etc when changing my oil. I have had zero problems with clearance on either vehicle and we go camping and hunting throughout the year."
1637,5,greta item
1638,2,"It fits well, but shakes like a feather on the road after it is installed."
1639,5,"Fit my '69 Johnson 6hp perfectly. Can be a bit tricky, like other impellers, to get into the pump housing. I used a little dishwashing detergent to slicken things up a bit. Pumps water the way it should. Nice strong stream from the tell-tale. No issues."
1640,3,Design sure looks great but it is a bear to put on.  If you do not have a whole lot of bike experience let the professionals do it.  The whole vacuum hose thing threw me off and I had to do a little researching.  Make sure you know how to differentiate between different screws.....you will need to know it.
1641,5,"I was a little worried about the quality, but these are very good.  I would not use them for nuclear waste, but for water, soap or vinegar solutions, they work well."
1642,5,love it
1643,5,Wow I got some brownie points off this one - Wifey loves this helmet and I wish I brought one for me - currently looking UPDATE: Was in a horriffic accident hit by a car wife and I was riding my Ultra Classic she was wearing this helmet - saved her life!! The face mask was ripped off but no head damage!! Loved this helmet
1644,5,"Grill mat works well, it helps catch all the dripping and crust that may fall from the grill and annoy my boo.  She is happy that something is there to catch all the crust and keep up with our maryland theme."
1645,1,"Followed directions completely...primer adhesive...paint...top coat. While the paint matched perfectly, the top coat does not give a glossy finish like the rest of my car's original paint. I called the manufacturer who suggested I tried buffing it, which I did, but still have a matte finish that doesn't match my paint. I'm stuck either having mismatched paint or getting it professionally repainted."
1646,5,"In perfect condition for my car and its awesome! Its nice and small but, looks perfect on my car! Thanks!"
1647,4,Fit was good. Little hard to work the gas lines on to the fittings. Machine works great. Price was excellent.
1648,5,"This should be standard for all states that require front tags.  It helps to protect you, and prevents you from dinging the car in front of you when you bump them, or they bump you."
1649,5,These r well made lense covers. Will definitely do the job it is made for. Worth a look and a buy.
1650,5,Perfect gloves!<br />These gloves are light and confortable. The fit are normal and have an excelent grip!<br />Protection in the full hand!
1651,5,"I bought this adapter along with the roughly half-million other things you need with a new travel trailer, and on the very first day, we end up in a space with a burned 30-amp socket on the pedestal. Not just a little singed looking, but burnt so badly, what used to be a slot was round.<br /><br />Not wanting to take a chance on burning my plug in a bad outlet, I used this to plug into the undamaged 50-amp socket."
1652,5,"This shade fits perfectly in my 2013 Hyundai Elantra. With the visors down, the shade is firmly held in place. There is no sagging or other gaps. This shade fits so well I laugh at people who have ill-fitting shades and wonder what the heck they were thinking.  Buy this shade, be happy, and mock others."
1653,1,"DID NOT FIT MY TRUCK AFTER 3-HOURS REMOVING MY EXISTING SYSTEM ONLY TO FIND OUT I HAD TO PUT IT ALL BACK. BE VERY CAREFULL WHEN ORDERING AUTO PARTS, EVEN THOUGH THEY SAY THAT IT WILL FIT SOMETIMES IT DOES NOT."
1654,5,I haven't had to use this rain suit yet but the quality is very nice. Fits just right. Sitting in my saddle bag waiting for some rain.
1655,4,"The top fit my 1991 Wrangler but I was so disappointed that there was no \\""tinted\\"" window(s). I feel a bit ripped off. The product title clearly says \\""tinted\\"", yet that was not true in my case. We live in AZ and my Jeep has no A/C, so I was hoping some tint would help. However, my son, who drives the Wrangler, is thrilled that he can see thru clear windows and that the zippers work, etc. Prior top was bought in 2005, so it was time to get a new one. I was disappointed, but not enough to send back. My son is happy, so I'm going to just take the hit. I wish I could complain to Amazon, but I don't see anywhere to do that."
1656,2,I specifically asked for the panels for a 2006 WITH factory flares and a crew cab ! What came was for an extended cab W/O factory flares! How can that be so hard to understand? Probably will NOT order anything else because it will be the wrong item when it arrives
1657,1,This was the second try at getting the right part for my f350 and it still is incorrect. Both orders of this blower motor were labeled for my truck but neither fit correctly.
1658,5,If you are looking for something to take those ugly black streaks off your camper then look no further.  This stuff really works.
1659,3,"These look great and work well for me, but I added some silicon to ensure they won't fall off. These do not<br />attach the way the originals do.... They have been on for a month or so with no problems.  Without added adhesive, I am not sure how well these would work."
1660,5,"wished i had bought this ten years ago when i put together my little tilt trailer i got from menards.  works great holding the front up and back down so i can easily drive my ferris walk-behind mower up onto the trailer.  kind of a pain to install, but not too bad, take your time."
1661,4,"My spouse's family member spilled red ice-cream on my Volkswagen CC's rear leather armrest, had it been anyone else I'd holler at them for eating ice-cream back there! After going unnoticed for about two weeks until I got around to cleaning the interior. When I finally saw the spill, you could see the exact large drop size that had fallen, as it kept its shape but had sadly had time to bleed into the two inches around the drip. Now, when I finally found it, aside from being furious, I removed the remaining drip.<br /><br />What was left was a perfect circle ring surrounded by leather with the red ice cream's bleed stain. I tried my Armor-All wipes, and the result was a shiny stain. Next, I tried dish-washing detergent, that did nothing more than remove the shine from my Armor-All. After glaring at the stain, I started researching the best auto leather cleaner and found Chamberlain's Auto Refreshener.<br /><br />While I applied it to the stain, it did not give much effect at first. I was rather annoyed that I spent a small fortune on the bottle but proceeded to wipe down the remainder of my leather. The smell is fresh, yet not fragrant to bother one's allergies, and left a pleasing aroma for a day or so. After drying the Leather did look refreshed, yet slightly darker. The stain remained, but it was far less than original. Unless I point it out, most don't event see it. If you wear glasses, you definitely won't as I eventually showed the family member, and they were blind to it. I would use it again, but don't expect it to be magic: determined, well-set stains will be stains."
1662,4,Seem OK.Slightly different color than the original but maybe it was faded due to age.Should work fine. Will know more after paint job.
1663,3,"Not an expert on pneumatic tools.  Lucas has always had a good reputation for oils, been around for a long time.  I purchased it with confidence that it would do the job."
1664,5,It fits perfect  n the bike looks a lot better it looks a lot better  than the stock one n is not the flat one
1665,5,The splash guards are OEM so quality wise they are impeccable. To make the installation easier you would need a mini dual drive ratchet. Also the push pins for the front are kind of difficult to remove. I had to replace them with ones I bought from Autozone. This is a easy DIY with the right tools.
1666,1,"I received three of these mirrors and each one fit the passenger side, not the driver's side as indicated in the description."
1667,5,"I'm not a handy person so I was a little bit intimated to fix the windshield crack myself. The product came with good instructions so after 30 minutes voila! Crack on the windshield fixed.<br /><br />Just aware that depending on the size of the crack, it may not all disappear."
1668,4,NAPA only had straight hose in this diameter and I had a heck of a time making connections.  I respectfully disagree with the other reviewer- I was easily able to make a 90 deg bend to solve a tough installing problem. Thanks Amazon & Gates.  However I take 1 satr off because the listing doesn't mention the hose ID-  I had to google to find this info from other auto parts stores websites so I could find the right part here. Prime is awesome!
1669,5,"The muffler was the exact fit needed for my '89 Nissan d21 extended cab pickup.  It took considerably more time to remove the old muffler than it took to install the new one.  Due to the rust, it took an hour to remove and only twenty minutes to replace.  We have had it installed for a couple of  months now and we are surprised how many performance issues have been resolved in addition to the noise.  I purchased the gasket locally to confirm proper fit."
1670,4,"So first off, this thing is cool. I like it for what it is more than the use I have not yet (thank God) gotten out of it. Its light, small and comes with everything you need including that handy two port USB charger in case you are stranded and your phone is dead and you need to call for help rather than needing to jump start your car since it has a DC plug already.<br /><br />However, you will need an outdoor extension cable (1 port 3 prong parallel to the cable itself) to charge it as it is in this awkward spot that you can't really get a surge protector too. There are indoor ones available like this too but basically you will need a cable to charge it. Unfortunately, the product description didn't say that when I purchased it (or I totally didn't look at it properly) and had a battery backup that I couldn't charge.<br /><br />It also requires recharging everything month, which I believe means if you get stranded on the 29th day I don't know if you will have a full charge sitting on it. All in all though, at the sale price I got it for (and hopefully you do too) its well worth it. At the regular price, there are many others to compare to that may be cheaper."
1671,5,I had new shower doors installed and my contractor recommended coating the glass doors with this product before the first use. Makes clean up very easy.
1672,4,Does what it's supposed to do. I used it to hardwire a radar detector in my car and it was simple to install with this.
1673,3,"Not metal, plastic with metal toggle link, just like OEM part, though slightly different shape.  It works.  Was expecting metal per discription."
1674,5,Fit perfectly in my dad's new Jeep. He is very detail oriented and this fit perfect and he was very happy with it!
1675,5,"This has been one of the best upgrades that we have made to our 2000 TJ (Jeep Wrangler for the non-Jeep folks). We can actually see the road now and our safety and piece of mind in knowing what's in front of us was enough to justify this purchase. They also illuminate the sides of the road much better than any sealed beam light. Previously, we had sealed beam halogen bright lights on the Jeep that did not even compare to these new lights. Installation is simple (plug and play) and it was hard to beat the Amazon price. You'll want to adjust the new lights once you install them for optimal performance. These lights can be compared to the light output from newer technology lights on the road but at a fraction of the price."
1676,5,"Love it great remote and i jus like the fact that the price was not bad at all great product, worked well in my car."
1677,5,"I did a lot of research on the proper cleaning and care of leather auto interiors, and this product seemed to be the one I'd always come back to. I tried it on my car's seats and it did the trick. Cleaned off all the grime and got them looking new again. Didn't notice any pulling of the color and they retained their suppleness. All in all very happy with this product."
1678,3,I purchased for such these for my ATV and they all work. Unfortunately many of them had the circuiting boards sticking out of the back that can be felt with the finger and two of the 15 what had the circuitboard sticking out so far I was concerned if they were even sealed. You could not use double-sided tape on the back side had to be put on the side of them. After use in mud and water I found all of them still works properly but one was fogged up from
1679,5,I like this unit because it is easier to use than my old Actron unit and it can access the ABS areas which my old one could not.<br /><br />Actron has been making quality automotive devices for as long as I can remember.
1680,5,"excellent article! just as promised, very good quality,the article is exactly right for my truck C1500 Vortec 5.7 year 1998, Best quality  100% satisfied, I recommend ..."
1681,1,Didn't fit well. It wasn't sturdy enough to use as an armrest  Color didn't match. I didn't feel it was worth the price.
1682,5,"I love these towels. They are so absorbent and soft. I use them for cleaning everything (counter tops, appliances, the car, the dogs, etc.)"
1683,5,I had to use these right away for a very hard snap ring to pull out and succeeded quickly with this tool.
1684,5,"My original spare tire cover became useless when one of the zippers jammed and was damaged.  This genuine Honda replacement cover was significantly lower in price than what my local dealer wanted -- forty bucks cheaper.  And, I was very pleased to find that the zippers had been much improved over the original.  More heavy-duty, with larger, easier-to-grasp zipper tabs.  Please note that my CR-V is the base model with 2WD, not AWD, and the smaller tires."
1685,5,Had a cracked taillight and picked this up as a cheaper alternative than getting it from the dealer.  It fit perfectly and couldn't tell that it wasn't straight from Toyota.
1686,5,Run this in a 2011 Sonata Turbo.  Oil analysis always shows minimum engine wear metals. Change at MFG. recommended intervals. I would recommend this oil.
1687,5,"What a difference, the issue of jerky power between shifting was cured, i now enjoy my bike more than ever."
1688,5,"The part almost exactly like the original.<br /><br />The difference is that the original one was broken.  :-)<br /><br />Took just a few minutes to replace it. Just remove the screw, slide the old handle assembly forward, and disconnect the pushrod. You might want to tie a piece of string to the pushrod before disconnecting it to prevent it from falling into the door and making it easier to retrieve.<br /><br />Put the nylon clip for the pushrod in place, THEN insert the pushrod, and lock it in place with the nylon clip."
1689,5,"Perfect fit for the JK.  Dog slides around though, so I might have to think of something to make his paws grip!"
1690,5,These are great for minimal invasion testing and retrieval. Superglue on the hole when your done and looks like you were never there. These tools are a must have when testing anything already built.
1691,5,"These Warn Hubs where a great improvement to my F-150 4x4 ,they look and work awesome. The price was also very fair.<br /><br />Thank you"
1692,5,"This is my 3rd or 4th purchase of these lights.  I really like the warmth and brightness these lights produce in my travel trailer.  I started with 2, then replaced all my lights with the LEDS to reduce battery consumption.  Excellent lights, I don't think you will be disappointed."
1693,5,exact fit worked good thru this winter and great value for the money hope not to need another one anytime soon but then again it's a jeep thing.
1694,4,"I keep this in my truck and have a 12 volt cig extension cord for it. Came in very handy on a few trips. It does get a bit hot, but the magnetic base is nice and the light output is killer for this small lamp."
1695,1,"Not sure what type/brand of air hose fitting this is for, but the fitting is 2x bigger than any one I've ever seen. And the fitting is a female, not a male like every other one I've ever seen, so I can't even replace it.  This device is useless to me.  Guess I should've just gone to NAPA."
1696,5,"This hitch bar has more choices for height than the one we previously used.  Spouse got a new truck wanted this bar.<br />Is very pleased with it.  It's heavy, it works."
1697,5,"This has been on my eighty three RX7 for over a year , through a brutal winter and has held up well.  Great value.  Would order again .  Recomend."
1698,5,I am very happy with this purchase.  They came well packaged and are original equipment as described.  They are installed and work as advertised.
1699,4,Easy to hook up. Works as expected. It is a little touchy with adjustments  but you get used to it.
1700,5,Everything was there that was needed for the job and is working fine. Tabs for holding pan gasket are only good for 'bench' installation...would not have enough room for doing in vehicle due to length.
1701,5,Because they are not air assist they lowered the bike about one inch which is what we needed so the wife could &#34;flat foot&#34; the bike.  great ride all so.
1702,4,"this works great as a clear coat over other colors to make a glossy look. completely reversible and peelable, easy peeling off just make sure you have a thick coat to peel off"
1703,5,"looks great, it has good quality and is very easy to install...it seems durable, we'll see how it goes in some months"
1704,5,"Well the Angels were with me and so was my Jacket.<br /><br />I had to lay my cruiser down on the interstate doing around 75mph. It was either that or get creamed. I slid on my back and side for a good while. After stopping, I stood up, none the worse for wear other than torn jeans and a little lost skin on my left leg. My upper torso was perfect. In fact I could not even tell where I landed. The jacket was way tore up, but I will be buying another as soon as I get my bike back on the rode. Believe it or not, it almost came as good as I did.<br /><br />This Jacket is AMAZING and if anyone is a little dubious of a mesh jacket regarding Safety, rest assured it is a SAFE buy.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Most people have no idea how much cooler it is riding in a mesh jacket This one, like all Xelement products is well made. It is not big or a loose fit which is just the way I like it. The rain liner is a huge bonus as it is great for keeping the cold out on cold mornings."
1705,5,The Battery Tender 021-0123 Battery Tender Junior 12V Battery Charger came as ordered. No problems or suprises to report. Works good.
1706,5,Great dupe for BMW wiper blades. Wipes streak-free. Will have to wait and see if durability is comparable to BMW. No complaints for the price.
1707,5,"For my husband's new car. They seem sturdy, fit perfect. They get a lot of attention. I'd buy them again."
1708,5,"I had some seemingly bad scratches on my hood, about 5 of them, each about a foot long. I went to repair shop that quoted me &#34;$150-200) I then tried the Turlte Wax scratch removal pen which was a complete and total waste of money, so I decided to try this. I follwed its usage instructions and watched a few youtube videos. After using it I can barely see the scratches. Theyre still there, but you have to *really be looking for them to see them. Im honestly kind of blown away at how well it worked, it was definitely not expected. Very, very happy with the results and plan on buying more for the other scratches on my car. My only complaint is that there wasnt more compound in the package but for the price, its a minor complaint. Especially compared to what the repair shop would have charged. Pro-tip: make sure your drill is fully charged before you start so you dont have to stop half way through like I did."
1709,5,"Fits my 93 Integra.. Materials used is high quality, just like the OEM. its remanifactured from OEM after all...payed $150 for the last stock, after that price went back to $250. I was Lucky..."
1710,1,To much work had to call long distance still dont work.I have a 2004 Mustang and it dont work for my car all wrong
1711,4,I like my Airhawk and I kept it on the bike even for commuting.  The cover wore through.  I expect that same for this cover but it did the job when I needed it.
1712,5,"Covers my trunk space very well. Protects against spills, gives a great look. Very easy to clean if it gets dirty"
1713,5,This plate made mounting my antenna a piece of cake.  Can't imagine installing without it.  Should be included in the package at an additional price.
1714,5,Good purchase.  Installed and working perfectly.  No more clogged filter.  The cabin air now feels clear and fresh.  Thank you!
1715,4,a very good pump at a good price
1716,5,"I got this filter because the location on my bike is in between the headers. trying to get a regular hand tighten filter off and on with it in this location is near impossible since there is no room to grip. This wrench on filter is easier to get on since it can use a tool to help. Its also K&N so the price was higher, but I know I get better quality. Check youtube for videos that show comparisons of internal components used by different filters(spoiler alert: FRAM is usually the worst)"
1717,4,"It fit, it came in time, it's a good replacement for the original especially when the original has a big hole in it"
1718,4,These led lights were easy to install and so make a better light for the black interior than the factory bulbs.
1719,1,Not good quality. The heads pop right off and the plastic has major flaws. I bought these for my toddler and unfortunately I won't be giving then to him.
1720,1,The fit of this piece is so poor that you cannot line up the edges without adding fibreglass on virtually all the edges so that there is a unform seam line similar to the stock hood. They don't call this stuff chinese junk for nothing.
1721,4,"I have had a long term interest in this type of product before they were even available. I love cars, technology and getting additional information from how I live, work and play. I have a Nest thermostat at home, I use Wemo devices to turn lights on/off from my phone and this is the next natural extension for me-- more information about my car and driving.<br /><br />I'll get the bad part out of the way first-- I had pairing issues at first. It may not have been more than 10 minutes of issues, but the app kept telling me to unplug & replug the device. Knowing how my phone works and the old &#34;have you rebooted yet?&#34; from the PC days, I rebooted my phone and everything continued on with no issues.<br /><br />Once sync'd and working, the device automatically detected my car and configured it for me. The app is absolutely beautiful, and intuitive. It easily shows you how your driving is going, when you park and aren't moving the app automatically shows you where the car is (no need to drill through a menu, just designed simply & in a smart way), and you can easily access settings, functions, etc. in a way that is easy to discover and understand. You don't need a manual to discover & use this product.<br /><br />I don't try to hyper-mile, but I did learn quickly that I'm already an efficient driver. My car does already show me current MPG and overall MPG, and I'm comparing this data to my car's data and it's very close. For someone who really does have no grasp on how efficient or aggressive they hit the gas & brake pedal, this can easily help those who don't know. It could also be great for teenagers who you want to remind when they're going over 70, but don't necessarily want to nanny-mom them with an expensive solution.<br /><br />I was most interested in the emergency function that could call if I had a bad crash. This is something that you have to pay $20 a month for, minimum, with something like OnStar. I'm surprised they haven't come out with a device like this yet. This is a curious feature because you'll never know how well it works until you have an emergency. Of course it won't work if you don't have cell signal, if your phone is damaged, or if the device is dislodged before the crash it detected, but I really liked the feeling of knowing there is at least potential for some automated process to take place if I should have a severe crash. a &#34;simulate emergency&#34; would be interesting to try so you can see what would happen without really calling 911 or your emergency contacts.<br /><br />I've discovered and enjoyed a lot with this device in only its first day. I did want to concur with the support comment on another reviewer's note that they couldn't connect with the car's Bluetooth hands-free with this device connected at the same time-- I had no issue doing that, and as well still maintaining a connection from my phone to my Jawbone UP24 all at the same time.<br /><br />I was also a little scared or put off by the review talking about personal data and VIN number and web-enablement. Every modern tool with a smart phone app stores its data in the cloud. Whether you call the cloud a cloud, a private cloud or a website, every other device I have does this, so in this case I did not feel concerned. My insurance company has my VIN and knows my driving history, the BMV has my VIN number, etc. I would like to know more specific information that is uploaded & stored about my driving history. Do they store constant GPS & location data/speed data, or only acceleration trends and start/stop location/park location? I plan to learn more on that point.<br /><br />I can really see the future potential for a product like this. One thing comes to mind is fuel and travel: If you're in a place with limited fuel stops/gas stations and it knows you are x miles from the next one and you only have 1/4 a tank, it could recommend that you fuel up soon, etc. It could recommend more fuel efficient routing of trips if I could sign in with Foursquare and it sees that I often go to the dry cleaner first, UPS store second and Walmart third. Maybe it makes more sense to go to the UPS store last because the total mileage of the trip would be shorter. The possibilities are endless and I'm excited!<br /><br />I had a simple device looking like this that could *only* read codes. This is a huge upgrade for not that much more in cost. I want to get one for everyone I know so we can compare stats!<br /><br />Feel free to ask any questions below in the comments and I will do my best to answer ASAP.n with Foursquare and it sees that I often go to the dry cleaner first, UPS store second and Walmart third.

1722,5,"very good instructions.  not a do it yourself job as a lift and air tools/metal drill needed.  very good, heavy duty paint job."
1723,5,"I would let everybody know how great these plastic rail covers are ,great price and easy to put on ,thank you"
1724,5,Transformed my 360.  Can't tell it's idling sometimes.  Exhaust doesn't burn my eyes anymore.  Looks good on the engine.  Great.
1725,5,"Not a whole lot of options for perfect fits for the earlier model Miatas.  I guess U1Rs are typically for lawnmowers and such.  The entire class of battery doesn't show up in Consumer Reports car battery reviews.  I took a dead Delco 3-3989 out (lasted almost four years).  Chain auto stores had similar batteries, but would have required a simple change of the vent tubes (from existing/original round to rectangular).  The batteries I saw were not only more expensive, even after the core exchange, but they were also manufactured months ago.  I got Advanced Auto Parts to buy the old core from me for a $5 store credit, and ordered this Marathon battery for $93 total.  It arrived the next day (despite their week+ shipping estimate), and was packed in a solid box perfectly wedged into 2&#34; of foam on all sides.  The battery was manufactured this month (E4), was fully charged, and fit exactly into the trunk battery spot, including the battery &#34;strap&#34;, the hooks at the top of the battery strap, and the original round vent tubes.  We'll see how many years we get out of this one, but so far, it doesn't get better/easier."
1726,1,"This net smells so horrible I had to put it outside in the sunshine in hopes to get rid of some of the smell!  It is much bigger than I expected, but I may be able to get it to work to hold my helmet on my bike, if I can get it to not smell so bad! I do not recommend this net."
1727,5,Good stuff.  It is also encased in clear outer sheath. Should be durable. I used this to supplement a another wiring set to make the entire harness longer.
1728,5,"I have looked everywhere for something like these in stores with no luck. I am so glad that I found these here on Amazom.<br />Now I can hang my lights and other small items from my awning. Very good price and great quality AAA++++<br />I do recommend buying these.....you will not regret doing so.<br />Thanks Camco, I will be shopping for other items that you offer (:"
1729,5,I used to use mink oil until I found out the dirty little secret that mink oil is just a good marketing lie for PIG FAT. Yes that is correct....pig fat.  I researched the best conditioners and Lexol was rated #1. I agree. Excellent product.
1730,5,Purchased to use on the bullwhip that I purchased but find that I am using it on other items as well. Very pleased with the product.
1731,5,"This is a lovely key chain - well constructed and looks better in person than in the photo shown.  It has a good weight to it and the writing on the ring not only is bold and clear but appears on both sides of the circle.  For the money, this is an excellent buy!"
1732,5,works great for the cost really good perfect match and fit id recommend to others :) get it now :D
1733,5,This item was such a vital item in the post- SUPER STORM SANDY days.  It charged my iphone and i was able to see colored TV  on the Axion AXN 7 - inch  handheld tv.  Up to recently I was able to charge my friends dead car battery !! she had NO AAA<br /><br />It was listed on Kiplingers 10 must have emergency items . I'm so glad I read that article. I bout 6 out of the 10 items it recommended.
1734,4,No problema. I used it on my 04 oldsmobile van; hopefully I get no surprises that discredits my initial take.
1735,5,"Fit perfectly! And the color was correct... I am very happy I can protect my carpet now. having my own business as a housekeeper, I have to also transport trash and this liner has been a saver so far. I will be ordering the floor mats for the front before winter."
1736,5,"Quality construction, these do the job as advertised. Glowing indicator lights on the switch look sick at night. Allows me to ride in temperatures that would have made me think twice before. No more aching hands. Gets toasty right through the bars and gloves! Installation was simple enough, though drilling the bar was a chore. A must have for rain or shine riders."
1737,5,"Great Manual for the DIYer. For US folks, there is some information that does not apply (I don't think they imported the 636 motor in 2002), but works great for any other 95-02 Ninja 600 as well as the 2005-2008 ZZR-600 (which is the same bike as 2002 Ninja 600).<br /><br />Lots of pictures and explanations. Way easier to use than the factory manual."
1738,1,"Complete crappy, cheap from China. Shop not buy them. I had a box burn up within hours of install. After checking I found 4 of the wires to the grill lights had shorts. Spend the extra money and get a quality light. I filed for a refund, sent them back, and never got my money. The company will not respond to any emails. Wish I could give negative stars."
1739,5,"This is the 2nd M8000 I've purchased.  The first one is still running strong ... this one is going on a different Jeep.  The first one has never failed me in all the years I've had it.<br /><br />But, Warn will provide support and parts even for really old winches if needed. I just finished restoring a Warn 8274 built back in Feb 1982 as a Christmas present for my son.  Warn reps helped me find the right parts and provided advice on the rebuild. Try getting that type of support from any other winch manufacturer!!!<br /><br />And, it's made in the USA and support is in the US."
1740,5,"This fits perfectly on my 2014 Prius. Though I read online that some Prius owners had to remove the car's underbody plastic cover to install the hitch, I found it unnecessary. Make sure you have a 6&#34; ratchet extension and you will be fine."
1741,2,"most be something wrong here, 8 ounces a hub bearing? I don't think so.... please clarify this because I need 2..."
1742,4,I LIKED THE SEATS BUT THEY DID NOT FIT MY SEATS IN MY CAR....TOO BAD....MAYBE NEXT TIME I WILL TAKE MEASUREMENTS...
1743,5,Filters great oil looks new even after 3000 miles. Whish they where made in the USA still though some are other's madein mexico Guess demand went up they needed more suppliers.
1744,5,Worked like a charm to get rid of the code and engine light.  Although the one in the back was a beast to get in! But saving $200-$300 on labor was well worth it.
1745,5,"The original handle on my son's car broke off this winter (on one of the many icy mornings we had in the east).  This was the original part and color of the car.  We had a body shop near us put this in for $50.  The color matches exactly, works great, and saved us a lot of money!"
1746,5,"That's the truth! we never needed DHS after 9/11. The security of this nation has always been americans with guns and the military. We can defend our selves just find, we always have!"
1747,1,the part i got is not the right part ... the gas filter is no the one show in the pic  you guys  showing the wrong part...
1748,5,Took five minutes to install using a flat head screwdriver to jimmy the holding clips.  Hood now rises on its own after it is unlatched.
1749,5,My boy friend was able to get this installed in less than 30 minutes.  Plus he didn't have to read the directions.
1750,5,they were better then expected. Grate quality for the price. The instructions were simple and to the point. I got them really fast. Installed them the next day. I would recommend them to a friend.
1751,5,"I am very happy with this luggage compartment cover.. I bought a Subaru Forester, and I  really like the vehicle.. but the only thing I was not happy with is if I had purchased something in a store, and put it in the back, then decided to go to another store, or restaurant I would worry about the things in the back of my vehicle... Purchasing this blocks everything in the back of my vehicle, so I don't need to worry so much...<br />The product works great, and is easy to remove if necessary.. I also saved over 30% by buying it through Amazon."
1752,5,"i had the other version for a long time.  glad to see this company still in business.  my old one the bowl just blew out.  the upgrade to the auto drain is worth the money.  the way i have my compressor setup, it was a minor problem getting to the drain valve.  most of my pneumatic tools will operate with this regulator.  i only a couple that need more volume and then i just use the bypass i have setup.  with my setup i could not use the next size up."
1753,5,Same as description and pictures and it only tooked me like 4 hours because the front headlights there were a little hard to install but am happy now how my car looks :)
1754,5,"Installed on my 08 V-Strom 650.  Raises about 3&#34; over stock, pulls back about 2&#34; further than OEM.  No cable mods required.  Much better ride, my right hand doesn't cramp up anymore."
1755,5,This is the second seat belt extender I've bought.  They are well made and really are a major help to me.
1756,3,The problem with this press is the wench on the side was really cheesy. The company sent another one and it was improved but still not that much better. We ended up mounting the wench on the top of the press to get the thing to work. Also the pump system was so slow it took forever to press something. We mounted an electric pump on the side to make it a lot faster.
1757,1,"NO!  NO!  NO!  Beware beware beware!!!  I bought these defective Gorilla Lug Nuts as part of a wheel package from Discount Tire.  Within 25k miles, these Gorilla lug nuts wore out with the threads almost stripped.  Not quite stripped, but loose enough that the wheel was extremely loose and the lug nuts could be tightened by hand.  One wheel lost a lug nut.  40 years of driving, never saw a single lug nut fail.  Now most of these horrible cheap material Gorilla lug nuts have failed.  You have been warned."
1758,5,"Well first let me say that I got shipped GearWrench ones and NOT KD but who cares they are thick gauge metal and very heavy duty. I bought these to give customers something to look at when explaining to them they need brakes. Customers need visual aids, this is a great selling tool. If they see they are down to the last yellow or in the red they know they have a problem. If you are a mechanic I suggest buying these just to have a visual aid for the customer."
1759,5,"Got this because of its lube characteristics and also its anti corrosion abilities.  It has many uses.  And I have tried many others, i.e we are not talking 3 in 1 oil here, but oils with various lubricating additives like poly teflons, and synthetic chemicals.  BTW,  I use Royal Purple in my 17 year old mint, 100k mile truck, at 10 dollars a quart.  I picked it over Redline."
1760,5,"Worked great for my 2004 Dodge Ram that had a Mode 1 door failure.  (To diagnose Mode 1 door failure - I had air through the front vents, but was unable to select floor or windshield vents).<br /><br />The door is plastic, but appears to be slightly stronger than the original door that was replaced.  The pin with the stop is metal and appears far superior to what was replaced (the original OEM plastic pin was broken and was the cause of the failure on my vehicle).<br /><br />The instructions included with the door are somewhat lacking in detail (go to Dorman's website to see the exact instructions that are sent with this door).  I would not have been able to properly diagnose and complete this repair without aid of the Youtube videos that exist for this problem.  In short though, the repair involves removing a few dozen screws and removing 4-5 pieces of the dash.  The plastic duct work is then cut into with a Dremel or similar tool following the pattern that is included in the instructions - both the outside of the duct and a useless plastic divider is cut out.  The old door is removed (Pull the old white plastic pin out with pliers) and the new door is fit into place.  The inner divider piece that was removed is thrown away - this is only there for future vehicle enhancements and doesn't actually serve any purpose.  The outside duct piece is reattached with the provided metal duct tape.<br /><br />I generally take my vehicles in to a mechanic for fixing, so I am not particularly apt to try do-it-yourself repairs for a vehicle.  In this case, I couldn't justify the price to have this issue repaired professionally.  I would rate the difficulty of this installation a 4 out of 10.  Plan on 1-2 hours to complete the work."
1761,5,"Although the head rest is cheap, the formed body of the creeper is sturdy and fully supports my 200+ lbs."
1762,5,I use this for my sliding glass patio doors and hurricane shutters.  This is the first product that has worked...no mor fighting sticky sliders
1763,4,The rotor fit the application (1973 Corvette) and seemed well made. I was disappointed that it was manufactured in China. I thought for sure that an actual ACDelco product would have been domestically made.
1764,4,"Helmet is lightweight, comfortable and full of vents.  Thought I would need to wear ear plugs for noise but was pleasantly surprised."
1765,5,Lights are super fast and easy to instal. Lights made a great big difference in appearance and lights! Affordable and shipped quick.
1766,5,"Worked like a charm, unfortunately the security bolts were oversized so they could not be covered. Nonetheless the rims look even better with the chrome covers."
1767,5,"This worked beautifully. I have a leather couch that sits partly in the sun, so there was some dyness and discoloration.  This went on very easy, but I did get a little nervous when I first looked at the color...it was much darker than the couch.  by the time I woke up the next morn, it was all soaked in and looked great."
1768,5,i bought this product and it was exactly what I was looking for although I did not measure the demensions accurately for the width of the flares was way to big for the type of tire I had on my truck. althought the product was worth its while on my brothers truck and he is a happy camper now. dont get me wrong I was so impressed on the product that I reordered the  flexy flares just at different demensions!
1769,4,Second what the other reviewer said about the diameter being slightly different.  The OEM hose clamps are just slightly too small and it's not worth your time to fight getting them on.  Otherwise good product.
1770,5,I crack up every time I see it and people love it.<br /><br />The decal went on easily and is staying on strong so far.
1771,5,The frame is substantial and mounted easily.  Looks great on my Pathfinder.  The screw covers didn't really snap over the screws that I used which were the flat ended ones (you get 2 of each type).  I just used some clear silicone caulk inside the caps to hold them in place.  Once the silicone dried they were firmly fastened to the screws.  There will be no reason to remove them unless I sell the PF.  Chrome finish is high quality and looks great.  I live in the desert southwest so I will not be able to advise if this will hold up to winter snow and salt on the roads.
1772,5,Havent had any trouble yet. Gave it to my mechanic and he installed it no problems. Really happy with the price and service.
1773,5,I used to use WD40 until I found Motorkote and I love this stuff I'll never go back to WD40.
1774,5,"Very nicely made, no problems with the fit would recommend anyone rebuilding these transfer case to prevent the oil pump rubbing a hole in the back case."
1775,3,"The mirror surface is ok. the clamp leaves a lot to be desired, you will have to secure the clamp by other means to keep it from twisting on the bars.  It works ok for a rearview mirror on a can am commander, but not well at all for a side mirror..."
1776,5,Easy install instant performance even made my screaming eagle exhaust more throaty always trust S&S I have for the last 10 years and have never had a bad thing to say about them
1777,5,Fit perfectly & was easy to install.  Saved myself $200 by not going to the dealership.  Definitely a good purchase.
1778,5,"They fit like a glove, do a great job, and were about 70% the cost of the VW OEM mats.  Great buy, I was very happy."
1779,5,"I asked several people if this works with a 150cc and they said yes it did, so I gave it a gamble.  Not only did she work, but I did not have to make any adjustments to this carb.  Just don't buy any size smaller than the PZ20 or the carb will not provide enough fuel for the bigger motors.  For example a PZ19 would be considered a smaller size carb.  Diffidently cannot beat the price, my grandson's bike sat for nearly 2-years, and even though I cleaned the carburetor, could not get it to run right, it had a very bad hesitation and would did once you gave it throttle.  Not any more, $20.00 later and good as new."
1780,5,"I really like the finish, design and protection you have. Fits very well and it shows that it is of good quality. The price is pretty good.<br />It has enough pockets to help much."
1781,5,There was no breaking in with this helmet it is very light and very comfortable from day one. I love it!
1782,5,"Simply put, a well made adjustable hat of good quality I would recommend! Not much else to say about a hat."
1783,5,"This product works very well to take small imperfections out of glass. I helped my son with centerpieces for his wedding that involved empty wine bottles. Some were scratched and had other surface imperfections. After using this glass polish, the bottles were perfect. Great product !"
1784,5,"Everything came as promised and it was a perfect fit for my car. This is the 3rd automobile part I've purchased through amazon and I'm stoked about the results I've had thus far. I've also purchased a clutch master cylinder which I was somewhat unsure about but it was a perfect fit as well. I'm finding most parts to be cheaper here than at Autozone, O'reilly's, Pep Boys, Kragen, etc."
1785,4,"the product works great the applicator could be a little better it came apart near the end of doing my top maybe I was a little rough, but just a suggestion maybe use a different applicator sponge"
1786,4,"After reading the review of this product I was excited for it to arrive at my doorstep. I had been looking for a tire dressing that is high gloss and long lasting. Upon arrival, I applied it to my tires using an applicator which was specifically designed for the job. There were several bumpy areas on my sidewall so I was a little heavy with the product. It rained for three days after my application. The rims on one vehicle turned black. The rims on my other vehicle were already black, so the fun off wasn't noticeable. After driving the vehicles I encountered a large amount of product to have been spun off all over my freshly waxed door. Subsequently, my advice would be to be mindful about the amount of product you apply and wipe off any excess. On the plus side, it gives you a fresh looking tire which has now been looking good for two weeks."
1787,5,This is a good product. It replaced the original perfectly. It has been on my car for a fewcyears so it is durable. I would purchase this product without hesitation again. Good quality and craftmanship.
1788,5,I got this from autopartstoys and was so excited to put it on. The company had already finished the first three steps and included a retractable measuring tape for me. They were super easy to finish putting together and to install on my car. Love them!
1789,5,I put these on the front. Work great and fit well. I recommend them for the front as they are a little thing for the rear.
1790,4,These are really good wipers but I can't say they're the best. They are a really good value though for being as good as they are.
1791,1,"This stuff is garbage.... You would be better off with black spray paint. It does not cover well, it comes out in splatter form and then does kind of even its self out. The nozzle constantly clogs. It is dries very soft and is not durable, it scratches very easy. As some one else posted use the rustoleum bed liner, it sprays on much better and dries to a very hard and durable finish.  This stuff is more like a rubber under body spray."
1792,1,"This part would not work for my vehicle and I had to return it. When i ordered it, it stated it would fit my Truck but when I went to install, I had to return it!"
1793,3,The ride is better that the original shocks on my 250 but the shock bodies have begun to rust already.
1794,5,Perfect looking. And easy to attach.<br />Will not weather and remains looking as good as the day you attached it.
1795,5,"This bumper is awesome. Easy to install and better protection compared to any others i've seen. After having to winch up steep hills through snow and pushing buddies up some ice spots, i'm very impressed with how it has held up."
1796,1,"The price was right, but did not work, would not program. Ended up using the new contacts on my old electronics."
1797,5,works just great...used it all winter on my bike...if you own a atv..boat...camper...motorcycle...the price is awesome..a must have...arrived when they said it would...i only order from amazon
1798,2,"I purchased this for my 2011 dodge ram 1500 quad cab.  It was sent out quickly, but they sent me the rear guards for a quad cab and the front ones for a crew cab.  I called and had them send out a replacement for the front guards to swap out and they sent me ones for a regular cab.  After i called a second time to try to switch them out, and they told me that the quad cab ones were sold out.  I got my money back and had to drop off the other wrong guards at UPS to be sent back.  After about a week and a half of dealing with this i have nothing to show for it. They were very nice on the phone and did send the replacements out quickly.  Just wish they were the right ones."
1799,5,"This is a two part spray that needs to be combined prior to use. It is easy to do, but once combind you only have a 48 hour pot life to use it. That being said this is what it is a urethane spray. Do not put it on too thick or it will become spongy and soft like a skateboard tire. It is great for little touch-ups. I pulled all the trim from my jeep, and painted it to match the exterior color of my jeep then used this stuff to give it a glossy coat. It worked great, and went on super clear. Make sure you give it time to harden, and make sure your prepwork is there. I also gave it a light sand and buff once it had hardened, and it turned out flawless. I can't say enough about how handy this stuff is. I wish it had a longer pot life, or they made it in a smaller can, but all in all a great product."
1800,5,Setup was a breeze! worked like a charm for the fraction of the price! I would recommend for anyone who is in need of a replacement.
1801,5,Look good.  Fit perfect.  Shipping was as expected and no problems.  They add a little bling to the drab looking stick mirrors.
1802,5,"these led switches work well, the led is perfect on them and they are small enough to mount anywhere you want"
1803,4,Wasn't as big as I thought it would be. In that as bigger person it's harder to get over my head and it's not as tall on my neck as I was looking for. But it is warm. and I use it under a scarf. We've had a brutal winter and it helped to keep me warm.
1804,5,"They are a great way to keep the floor clean and fit just right. Easy to install, clean and look good."
1805,5,"These are very nice, warm riding gloves. I will say I normally wear an XL glove but the L fits me better in these."
1806,5,Bought this to replace  the original plastic BOV that came with my Ripp supercharger.  Works great and love that it's adjustable.  this thing will not be failing the way the Bosch ones did.
1807,4,"I vomited on my leather jacket. Classy, I know. I used this stuff to restore the pliability of the leather once I had removed the vom. It's not quite new feeling but very nice."
1808,5,it was bigger then i was expecting but thats ok looks great on the back windshield of my stang :) very happy :)
1809,5,"Don't bother with getting the non-long life bulbs in such applications. Just get these, install them, and forget them. Brighter and more reliable than any sub-$100 LEDs."
1810,5,"Worked great, easy install. Saved a great deal of cash by buying it here, and installing it myself, versus going to the stealership. Buy with confidence."
1811,5,"Best wiper blades I've used.  Easiest to install, too. Almost no streaking due to design, and I'm talking about driving in rain, sleet, snow, salt and ash on the roads.  I hope they keep making these blades, because they're far superior to ALL others I've used."
1812,4,I use this on an RV refrigerato.r  Very helpful.  Provides helpful information as well as current time.  Provides inside refrigerator temp.
1813,4,Fast shipment!!! The product was in perfect condition. It took me 15 minutes to install with the proper tools. It wouldve been 5 minutes if it wasnt for the rubber seal. The rubber seal doesnt quite fit the space between the fas cover and the edges of the gas tank opening.
1814,2,"Bought to replace a 1999 Subaru.<br /><br />Physical size and dimensions are generally correct, but it does not at all fit in the brackets for the Subaru.<br />The number and function of the wires is the same, but the clips at the end are wrong, meaning I'll have to splice the ends of the old ones on.<br /><br />Overall, this antenna doesn't fit precisely in any vehicle.  It's just a standard replacement with a bendable bracket, and screws so you can try and &#34;Make it fit&#34;.<br /><br />Good luck!"
1815,4,At first I wasn't sure it would fit on my bike (1997 Honda rebel) but it did and so far it is working great. Nice and easy to install.
1816,5,"So easy to apply. I applied to some motorcycle spooks, screwed it in and now it won't come out. Well unless I try really hard. The point is it makes the bolt immovable when you want it to and doesn't make it impossible when you want to remove the bolt."
1817,4,The seat cover had a loose seam on the drivers side.  I decided to keep it instead of the hassle of returning it
1818,3,"Pretty cheap & chincy,Bulbs are low wattage, blink too fast to be safe,had to fabricate mounting bracket,wires are not installed inside the light bar as pictured in the ad.I guess u get what u pay for,but be pretty handy with tools if u expect to install it on a Yamaha&#62;"
1819,4,"I was very happy with the quality of the jumper cables and flashlight. The first aid kit is ok, I think I need to beef it up a bit with some antibiotic ointment and a few more bandaids and tape. The case is very nice alot of room tho throw in some flares and the protective auto triangle's. I would have given it easily 5 stars but the first aid kit has minimal supplies. On the good side it's a easy fix to go to the store and purchase a few more first aid supplies. And to add the screwdrivers that were included were of good quality. I have no problem recommending this product,"
1820,2,I just used it for the first time(3-15-14) and the metal that you put your foot on to put up stand up with bent. I did not expect for it to be so weak.
1821,2,"I had to send the product back, when I ordered the directions for installing were misleading.  In order to install you actually have to take off your bumper and drill holes... too much work!!"
1822,5,Fit my 2010 F150 Super Crew perfect. Keeps the mud and ice off my running boards as this is what I was looking to stop.
1823,5,"Trunk and cargo area lights seem to be an afterthought, almost as if car-makers are saying \\""Throw a low-wattage fixture back there and we'll have one more 'standard feature' to pad the list in the brochure.\\""  That all changes when you plug in these li'l chunks of the Sun. Because of their extra length, they're particularly suited to horizontal installation as in dome, trunk and cargo lights.  If you can plug them in and they fit the enclosure, they're perfect for many cars made within the past 10 years and beyond like the trunk light in our 2004 Honda Civic sedan and the cargo light in our 2013 Subaru Impreza hatchback.  The pure white light complements the LED dome and map light bulbs we installed, spreading that white-hot LED bling into the dark forgotten regions."
1824,3,"The color is still not the gold it may seem in the picture, but they sent me a brand new one with the right size this time. sticking it to the clear paper was hard to do, and the size is a little bigger than the cover size but its an okay product."
1825,4,"The cable on the regulator broke on my rear passenger side window.  I drive a 2002 Grand Prix GT (4 door, obviously).  This part fit perfectly and took about 45 minutes to install.  I've never tried keeping the old motor, it seems like it's worth it to just replace the whole thing even if your motor still works.  With my luck the old motor would die 2 weeks later anyway.<br /><br />Be sure to buy some of the GM trim panel retainer clips, you will surely break some of them removing the door panel."
1826,5,Works great easy to wire up and matches my current ultra lite gauges perfectly. I was worried bc most recommend different brands of wideband air/fuel gauges but I am pretty anal about having all my gauges match and I don't regret it.
1827,5,"Not only is the price the best around for these riding glasses , but the shipping was incredibly fast. Very happy all the way around with this purchase."
1828,4,"This mounted easily on rear tailgate of 07 Wrangler unlimited x. It took me 2 hr to install, but I was getting a lot of nuisance phone calls at the time. Do duct tape it in place as you install. Stretch it really tight as you place each screw so it doesn't sag; I started to the right and moved left. Some have drilled the holes with a slightly larger bit than recommended, I did fine with the recommended size. It does take a lot of control to drill in the self taping screws: they are cheap and soft, and will strip easily. It might have been a tad easier with a bigger pilot hole. Drive them in slowly: it is very easy to round out the top, drive them in crooked, or over tighten. If you over tighten, they will pull through the grommets: I had a few dip deep into the grommets. They are holding for now, but I may have to put in a few washers if the grommets pull off completely. I have a third row in my jeep so the bags fit very snugly: perfect for keeping everything still. The bags are smaller than I expected, but the MOLLE straps will let you attach the bag of your choice.The big bag is holding a tow strap, gloves, jumper cables, and a D ring, small pack just has some bungees. The bags have an incredible assortment of internal compartments, but I have everything stuffed into central compartment. Bags come with shoulder carry straps, but you have to pack them inside or they will hang down too low. I am very happy with purchase because this stuff is not in my passenger compartment anymore and it doesn't fall out when I open tailgate."
1829,4,"The seat covers are awesome,  they fit my seats well, and they look cool.  The only thing I noticed was that in the picture there is gray checking up the center,  behind the design,  but the covers that I received didn't have that.  Besides that (which really wasn't a big deal) I love my seat covers!"
1830,5,"This tool os price less when it comes to the a/c system on your cars. The quality is above the average China made product and it works as advertised. If you want a time saving tool that is quality this tool will do it. Myself, I wanted to be able to change leaking schrader valves without discharge and recharge of the a/c system and it delivers."
1831,5,"I used this item to replace the tubes in a 12&#34; fixture.  I am pleased with the amount of light.  It is a warm white.  I would like to have the cool white, but it is not available.  I will purchase more in the future to reduce the 12 volt DC load of our RV."
1832,5,"The dealer wanted twice as much for the same hose. Replaced both fittings on the radiator without any problems along with replacing the hose. Also wanted to replace both fittings on the transmission. The transmission seals were extremely difficult to remove, because they are a press in type seal and took some thinking on how to press the new ones in.<br /><br />Its now about 3 weeks in service and no leaks."
1833,5,I have an HHR which is a cross-over vehicle. I am also on the shorter side when it come to height. I loved the extendable and yet sturdy handle which allows me to get all that midwestern winter off of my car.
1834,5,The fit was perfect and they were easy to install. Works great and keeps my hood up properly now. Thanks!
1835,5,Perfect fit and durability.Material is made up of high quality. Saved me from this nasty NYC weather this winter . Recommend!
1836,5,My best friends mom loved this. Her car has tinted windows and when she put it on the window she was afraid it wouldn't show up. She was thrilled that you can see it and read it thru the tint...
1837,1,"I never really got to use it. It stopped charging almost immediately. I did not buy through Amazon and after reading the internet review horror stories about Wagan's customer service on this product I decided not to bother contacting the company, It was an impulse buy for me; I wish I had read it's reviews first. One star is not a low enough rating option for this product. Something in the negative star range would be more suitable."
1838,5,"Easy to install took within 2-3 mins very silent and works very well, no streaks when raining... though i could have bought a 20 or 21 inch."
1839,5,Its legit! We had an ice storm hit my town and my window cling broke. I ordered and got in withing a couple of days! I had someone install it for me for a h2 hummer  . Thank you
1840,5,"This is the real deal,, great for black paint or any other color for that matter.  We use this to put on a final shine just before delivery of a new car at the dealer where I work.."
1841,5,"Exactly what I needed, must cheaper than buying local. Gate makes the best hoses, don't buy a cheap import, when you can get the real thing."
1842,4,"They fit perfectly and the arrived very quickly. It was easy to shop for the replacement and the price was one of the better ones.Will soon be purchasing new ones for the hood, as well."
1843,3,"These are for very small gauge wire. The description for this type of connector should always include the supported wire size and amperage rating. There are also no instructions for installation. You need to sort out which fitting holds the male pin vs. female pins and the proper sequence / orientation. Once you have it down, they work well.<br /><br />Seller should add supported wire sizes to the description"
1844,5,Bought this for hubby for birthday. He loves it! Jeep looks great now. Couldn't be happier with it. I would recommend.
1845,5,"Great product, no dipping necessary! You can Plasti Dip just about anything, here are a few thing's I've tried so far<br /><br />Rims - Hard to get out of tight spots but looks great.<br />Ez-pass - looks awesome in stealth black<br />Bottle of Jack - Plasti-Jack*<br />Roof - Hasn't leaked since<br />Strawberries - Ziplocks are for squares. Strawberries are some other shape.<br />Spray Paint Can - pwned<br />Hand - Latex gloves? What am I a caveman?<br />Caterpillar - Plasti-fly? still waiting...<br />Fire - Just try it.<br />@$!& - Don't be a fool Plasti Dip your tool!<br /><br />*Plasti Drink responsibly, Plasti-Jack and Plasti-Dip do not mix. See above."
1846,2,Doesn't work well. It's brittle and cracks easily. It's also a bit thick and does a great job of depressing the padded panels you try to remove. But I was able to work with it.
1847,5,"These are very nice.  They fit perfectly and seem like they will be durable for several years.  At this price, they had better last.  These won't slide around at all."
1848,2,"For the price, i expected some quality..but i got zero quality......on one cover on of the bungee's snapped, then one of the clips was sewed so poorly it literally came undone, and a different clip snapped and broke, all this happened during installation..."
1849,5,Put them in and went to work...that's a 700 mile round trip and the truck has a new peppy feel again...mileage improved! Very happy<br />with these sensors.
1850,3,"i say so because i noticed some compression imoprovement for say 1000km ,however upon investigation it seems my smoking 4banger was a result of a blown turbo and head gasket so not so sure if it went well with my turbo or not"
1851,4,"The fit and the color were fine. The velcro tape did not stick worth a darn on a clean dash, so I am going to buy some better 3M tape so I can get it to secure properly."
1852,1,"I concur with the previous review: this plug does NOT fit my Mazda B2300, as advertised.  I needed 14mm, but this one is only about 12mm."
1853,5,"This winter in the northeast has been pretty bad. With an SUV and a normal size brush I had a real issue getting my car clean every time it snowed, which was almost every day at one point. This has saved me tons of time and was able to push very heavy wet snow from the top of my SUV without much effort, The swiveling brush head works well depending on if you are using it as a broom or a brush. It seems pretty well made and hopefully will last me a while, I happened to get this very cheap which makes it even better in my case."
1854,5,It's amazing like having a new jeep again. I forgot how nice it was to have a liftgate that stayed open by it self.
1855,1,"All I used my bottle for was to spray a diluted carpet cleaner on the stains on my white carpet....The sprayer stopped spraying within 20 uses......As far as the warranty goes, they got ya there! Cost more to return than the bottle cost....."
1856,5,"Got them faster and then they said putting them on now.  Putting them on now, Will make my car look brand-new again"
1857,5,Good product!!!! A+ good response and low price I really recommend it to every one !! Add 2 mpg and much power
1858,4,"This is a great tool for self-defense. The only caveat is that someone has to be close enough to you to use it, which isn't super ideal, but it is better than nothing. I still have my pepper spray, and carry both just in case. For someone who works very odd hours, I like having something to protect myself if need by. It's also quite innocuous, which I like."
1859,5,Easy to install and they work as good if not better than the originals. I would recommend these to my friends and anyone else that rides.
1860,5,they will see you coming and in style like no other i recommed everyone have light like this on their bikes easy to install and look great
1861,4,"I ordered three of these - one each for myself, my daughter and Goddaughter.  Mine only lasted a year but was great while it worked.  My daughter and Goddaughter are still using theirs and it has been a little over two years now."
1862,5,"Best replacement wiper I have ever used on my Infiniti QX4 and Chevy TrailBlazer. Wipers are silent, not the slightest squeak. Clears rain effectively with very little to no streaking. I've used RainX in the past and the last set was so bad, I'd rather deal with the rain than have to use my wipers. Excellent buy!  UPDATE: 6 months, 1 very rainy spring, and 2 cross-Texas road trips later, these are going strong and still quiet, no squeaking, no streaking. Other expensive brands I've tried haven't last this long or performed like new. I don't think I'll put another wiper on any car I own unless it's a Bosch."
1863,2,"I like swiss tech's utilikey, however I received this tool as a gift, and was rather unimpressed. The light is more dim than other keychain lights, the tool itself is very thick and heavy considering how few functions it has. The screwdriver(s) are weak, slippery and uncomfortable to use. The blade is too small to be useful for more than a box cutter, and is disproportionately small to the rest of the tool. The bottle opener is a bottle opener. Nothing special.<br /><br />It's assembled well, I suppose, and comes as advertised, but you could do a lot better. Spend the extra $10-15, and pick up a leatherman style, which is more useful, compact, comfortable and much higher quality."
1864,5,"The cat back system fit perfectly, no cuts needed and sounds like a hemi! Big response when u hit the gas pedal"
1865,5,We were slow to rate this on because most inverters have problems get hot and don't last very long. We have had this on for 2 years now and use it all the time. Very well made and performs great.
1866,3,It's okay but a downgrade from a quality German made car and then installing a Chinese made rotor. Not too confident about the rigidity of their product.
1867,5,Using as wall art instead of license plate cover. It's basically a mirror with the Broncos logo. Really like how it looks!
1868,5,These were purchased as reading lamp replacements for my truck. Color is a crisp cool white. Installation was a bit dificult but only because of the style bulb no fault of Classy Auto's. They color match my Dome light LED upgrade perfect. Great product all around. I do consider myself somewhat of an expert on LED lighting at this point. Recomendation made!
1869,1,These people are unfair my on timeall I wanted to do was change them for smaller size they wouldn't let me do it
1870,2,cheap  n doesnt fold in not enought ajustment on it
1871,5,"Very well built al carrier. Loaded a large (16in) wheeled scooter weighing 290lbs. Very little tilt or shaking on front hitch. Highly recommend,. Plan to use on front of truck fiver combo every year for 10-12,000 miles a year. Easy assembly, will last for many years of use. Had to trim the corners off the ramp to clear the bottom of scooter plastic bottom. Otherwise, flawless."
1872,4,It worked but I was under the impression that my car had a remote starter. Well it does lock and unlock my doors.
1873,5,"This mat looks like it came with my Ford Edge. The color matches perfectly and the fit couldn't be better. It's very well made, it's strong, and doesn't get scuffed when I throw my gym bag, back pack or suit cases in the back of my car. Sure, my carpet will be left in pristine shape but while I'm using a mat, it's not an eye sore at all, in fact I like the look better than the carpet look. This should be standard issue with the Ford Edge!"
1874,5,called and in 5 minutes had remote programmed.  FREE INSTRUCTIONS  works fine and am pleased with product.  would recommend to anyone.
1875,2,Lint falls off the sponge.  It is hard to clean after use.  Just save your money and use an old T-shirt or hand towel.
1876,3,it is easy to rub the white &#34;paint&#34; off the sticker with your fingernails.  i am concerned the sticker won't last on on the outside of my car for that reason.  time will tell.
1877,5,"Easy to assemble, sturdy and very practical...just how gifts has to be in order to please my hubby!!!  This can help him a lot while he is on the road from one customer to another. He likes the convenience of being able to use the ipad without talking out the cover . Like another review says get the heavy duty .  Recommended !"
1878,5,Open box...wow looks great. Went to install ....have wrong part....just my F---in luck! I am waiting for a credit to reorder same.
1879,2,Bought this for a gift and my mother did not think it got very warm. Nothing more to say. ...
1880,5,"These have been nothing short of delivering! Big things come out of small packages for sure. There is some serious light output out of these suckers and the overall kit is so light you can literally mount the ballasts that are required to run them just about anywhere. I am going to buy another one of these kits for my fog lights because I am THAT happy with the overall output of them in the headlights alone. I would recommend these to anyone looking for an upgrade over stock. If you want to test the output and how much better they are then stock replace one side and leave the other side stock. You will see on your garage wall alone just how much better they really are. Instant on and off and virtually no bleeding of light scatter vs. HID headlights makes these the perfect replacements over stock Halogens. They are not blinding either because of the placement of the light itself on the bulb. I have not gone offroading with these yet, but with the hard driving over bumps I have done so far warrants no ill effect whatsoever to the lights. Highly recommended!"
1881,5,This came very well packed. It fit perfect. Color matched exactly. Very well made.
1882,5,"Very useful pocket. I use it for mobile phones, for drinks, for ashh tray and for badge, sunglasses and pens."
1883,5,I actually bought this item because I bend his last on and I wanted to replace it before he knew it.  Item came quickly as ordered.  He didn't know for weeks that it wasn't the original .
1884,5,Great for trash after a busy party.  Easy and convenient to use.  Fold and stores into a small area for storage.
1885,5,replace all 20 of 921 bulbs in 10 fixtures throughout MH.  Light quality is excellent.  Color is great.  Very bright.  Makes reading much easier!
1886,5,you can't really mess up an o-ring....fits as intended with no leaks (2 months so far)...buy it if you need it
1887,5,"I purchased one of these from another company and liked it so well, until I decided to see if I could find another one and I did.  People that saw it LOVED it and wanted to know...where did I get it from."
1888,2,I got many cracks just putting them on. Looks great on the car but they are really like one use product.
1889,4,"*Disclosure: I was contacted and given a sample of this product by HitchAnything.com*<br /><br />I really dig on LED lighting, especially on cars.  Now, I don't have a trailer, but I did have some ideas on what this could be used for besides that.  Even the product picture shows an alternate usage - aux lights on a truck.  Really, this setup could be used on just about any car, truck, van, or trailer as long as you are filling to install it or have it installed.  It's a simple kit, just stick the light strip to your car using the tape already attached to it, then plug it in.  (Note: If your vehicle isn't already set up for towing, installation is going to be more difficult and time consuming as the vehicles wiring will need to tapped into).  Myself, not a fan of using tape to hold things to cars, and the kit does come with a couple brackets for mounting it.  That's the way I'll be going, probably adding a few for good measure.  The kit comes with a pretty good set of instructions, including into on wiring.  I took a star off here, as the wire colors in the instructions didn't match the unit.  To complicate matters more, going to the HitchAnything website, the diagram they offer uses yet another set of colors.  Come on guys, really??  Contacting HitchAnything about the discrepancy didn't get a response.  (To be fair, I could not find this product on their website, so maybe they stopped selling it.)  Anyhow, on my sample, the wiring did match the description for which pin in the connector did what.  Running some spliced in wire on my '68 Ghia, I was able to test the unit thoroughly, including the added reverse light functions.  Because my car is currently a garage queen, I ran the wiring outside the garage so I could get an idea just how well the strip would be seen in broad daylight.  It looks good!  Comparing it to the original lighting in my old car, it was hands down much more visible.  Comparing it to my much more modern Honda Fit's lights, it was closer to even.<br /><br />In conclusion, I think the product itself is very good. It will take time and usage though to see how it handles weather and typical.<br /><br />In conclusion, I think the product itself is very good. It will take time and usage though to see how it handles weather and typical."
1890,5,"There was limited choice when looking for a 22mm lug nut socket. I'm ok with this limitation, as this product serves its purpose well."
1891,3,"They do look nice but their are quite a few problems... their are some small pitting on the welds no leaks though and they are ground smooth so that's alright I guess, second the lower O2 sensor is on the wrong side for my 2002 Dodge Neon. I needed it on the drivers side of the car the header has the port is on the passenger side. But the really big problem is with that ball joint gasket for the down pipe; Not the Joint itself but the hardware that it comes with the springs are far to long and really don't compress and the washers don't fit with the springs at all because their too big in diameter."
1892,5,"I love the ventilation holes! My original bumper finally rusted out after 25 years, and I'm hoping these will help keep the moisture from the dump hose out of my new one so that it can last even longer!"
1893,2,"I bought these and was initially quite pleased with the purchase. As I got into installing these into my Toyota truck I started getting some issues with fit (very tight) but not a big deal, and then getting creative in wiring. I wish they had something better for the marking/LED lights instead of loose wires that are not consistently colored to show polarity. The tough part came in that the focus of the projector head lights is not consistent between units. So the right has a softer pattern than the left! When I checked the IPCW website, the instruction link is broken and then they don't answer to email. Good price but you get what you pay for."
1894,5,"Used for back up lamps on my half ton pickup truck.  Installed to match license plate bulbs I put in.  No complaints, nice and bright with a clean white color vs old yellowing incandescent bulbs."
1895,5,I saw these on a site butthe doors were off the jeep so I wasn't sure if they'd fit. These looked like I could probably just mount anywhere so I decided to order. They came with instructions and they fit perfectly. My doors still close and they seem pretty solid. I would recommend these if you don't have a center console!
1896,4,Great quality for the price. The handlebar has a durable black coating. Quick shipment and the packing was very secure. I would highly recommend.
1897,5,"I was a little hesitant paying so much for a pair of day time running lights, but since I read Phillips<br />provides the DRL's for production cars I decided to buy them.  The lights are worth every penny.<br />The ease of installation,quality,and brightness of the light justifies the price.  You will not be disappointed."
1898,4,"Came with the later model tune installed, had to do a download before using on my '98.  It was fairly easy to do and only took a few minutes.  If you're using the speedo calibration menu, be sure you go out and take tire measurements if you don't already know the tire height in inches."
1899,3,The only thing wrong with this Dash Mat was that it was to wide from the windshield to the glove box and dash. I had to fold up the mat a little to make it fit just right. This went in my 1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited. Other than that it fit great.
1900,5,"Absolutely what I wanted, fits very well, I can breath with it on, and I would definitely recommend it. A Great buy."
1901,5,Fast shipping and good boots for the price. Very comfortable right out of the box. Lots of room in toe box area for wide feet.
1902,3,"I just had to use an included alcohol cloth to clean the brake light cover and stuck this on. I was able to get both of them straight, but on both the bottom bar didn't stay stuck. It looks like they should have made that bend a little bit tighter to have it fit better. All in all, it looks good, just doesn't fit perfectly."
1903,5,"These were a nice replacement for the factory struts that cost way too much. The quality, and price of this product is outstanding. They showed up in just a few days, and installed without any modifications. I highly recommend this product, and the seller."
1904,2,"Bought a pair of these for my 2009 Honda CRV. Both Amazon and PIAA website said it would fit. Passenger side fit fine, but driver's side wiper would not sit flat on windshield. Nothing in instructions about adjusting it, tried for a while but ultimately gave up and returned it, bought a pair of Bosch that works just fine. I like the silicon windshield coating that comes with these PIAA wipers, and I've had success with them on other  cars in the past, but just didn't work for my car, despite saying the opposite."
1905,5,"This is VERY sturdy, which unfortunately gets lost in the purpose for which I am using it. I have a Steel Case Leap stool for my computer desk and because it is so high I needed a raised foundation for my foot rest. Voila!"
1906,3,I am happy with the boot except they did not come in the color I purchased. I received black with yellow boot and I had purchased all black. Otherwise the shipping was fast and the price was great.
1907,5,These mats are great!  Fit the Fiat 500 perfectly and are doing a great job protecting my interior through this rough New England winter!
1908,4,I have been looking for this item for at least a year even went to Europe but had no luck. Then your service offered the product and I was delighted
1909,5,Perfect! They look awesome on my all black Jetta TDI. Not like other emblems that chip and look chrome underneath. These are solid black so if it ever does chip it won't be so obvious. Great quality product!
1910,5,"We have four rescue dogs, a rescue cat and four rescue rats so we definitely love this decal! We can't wait to put it on our car! We have to wait until it warms up outside a little but we absolutely adore this decal!"
1911,5,"O2 sensors wear out or burn out. You can debate or question the initial quality but the fact remains that when one fails, you have to replace it to pass emissions testing.<br /><br />The OEM part is made for GM by Denso. I found this after-market particular product through frugalmechanic.com, a search engine for car parts. It met my four criteria:<br />--Direct mechanical fit<br />--Correct connector on the wire--no adapters or splicing<br />--Worked--no codes shown and engine no longer runs rough (limp-home mode)<br />--Least expensive solution<br />It will be a long time before I know if it will last 130,000 miles like the original, but for now I'm delighted."
1912,5,"very smooth and easy to manuver, plenty of articulation even for the hard tight spaced jobs. I am a professional technician and this was well worth the money."
1913,1,"I needed wiper blades so I purchased these in an auto parts store. They were just awful.  They streaked, chirped and chattered immediately. There was always streaks and water left on the windshield.  I paid over $10 for these. What a ripoff. Stay with Anco or Trico."
1914,5,The fit is great which has kept the grime and other contaminates from getting to the carpet. I would recommend this 100%
1915,5,Works and fits well on my 2012 Lexus RX350.  With full synthetic oil and the oil filter socket wrench is a lot cheaper than having it done at the dealership.
1916,4,"The covers fit my impala seats just fine. The material is thin, almost shear, but it covers the entire seat. There's a lot of straps attached to it that I couldn't figure out how to tie around the seat. For the price, you can't beat the protection it provides the seat fabric though."
1917,4,"Works very good, great quality. It is making more horsepower now then with the stock system. It looks good as well."
1918,1,"This is will not fit for honda civic HX, It is miss lead information.<br />Do not trust when it say it will fit your car"
1919,5,Very Nice Recovery Strap at a great price I have used it and worked great. I would recommend this to anyone
1920,5,These are amazing seat covers and they were worth the money! They fit my seat very well. Also they are very confortable.
1921,5,"We use this in a very hot climate on outdoor patio umbrellas and the fabric on the outdoor furniture.  It repels water and protects from the sun like no other product we have tried, and the gallon size is the way to go when used with a heavy duty spray bottle.<br /><br />Before you waste your time with other products that do not deliver, use this first and enjoy your furniture, umbrellas or whatever for much longer!"
1922,5,Fit like a charm. Thanks to Lexus what could have been a 5 minute job took 30 minutes but I saved atleast 300 dollars doing it myself.
1923,5,"It's great. Gives you some much needed storage on a crouch rocket.  Costs a lot,  but to me it's worth it.  It should come with a small lock.  I rigged one up from an old travel case I had."
1924,5,"great product, has already paid for itself, however, not all features work on it...very easy to use tho, put dvd in computer and in a few min it was up and ready...the codes that it has read so far have been right on the money.."
1925,1,"Connected this w/the Battery Tender ring terminal harness to the motorcycle battery in my backup generator.  No-load voltage is appx 20v, however, then connected to battery, the battery still discharges to 10.5v.  And yes, it is connected properly. Doesn't seem to have enough current to bring battery back up to 12-13v."
1926,2,Received the keychain I the mail and the black face with the Honda logo fell off the actual key chain.  Glued back on but it is actually a bit large for the holder.  Actual key chain feels hollow and inexpensive.  Guess you get what you pay for.
1927,5,"Really smoothed-out the acceleration, gained 1 to 1 1/2mpg, on our 2012 CRV!  Really noticed performance improverment, after using Royal Purple synthetic fuel additive!!!  Climbed the mountains, on our recent trip to Las Vegas, almost effortlessly, and kept-up even with the newer 6 & 8 cylinder vehicles!!"
1928,5,"Like it!! I purchased two!! Gave them both as gifts, but I told them to apply once the temps rose for better application."
1929,5,"Fast shipping, clear instructions (worked at first try) and working great.<br />Will recomend this product.<br />I use it on a 2005 FORD Explorer."
1930,4,"This costs much less than original equipment and was a good fit, but the lack of replacement screws creates a hassle. The color was close. I didn't expect perfect for a 16 year old vehicle."
1931,5,"I bought these for my daughters new car, she loves them and has been getting many compliments from other &#34;pink&#34; lovers."
1932,5,Well made and the device charges four batteries easily.  The charger and all accessories are made of high quality material - shop / professional grade stuff.
1933,5,My hubby loved this and he can't wait to put this in his car the floor mats came sepertae which was kinda lame but other than that he loved it.
1934,3,"These are made of extremely lightweight hollow plastic, not the rubber I expected. Do not know if they will hold up, and I would only trust them on a flat rough surface. I'm afraid they could slide on epoxy garage floor so sticking with 4x4."
1935,5,"Put on your antenna or hang for rear view mirror, too cute, you can almost smell the frosting. Yum.<br />LUV"
1936,5,good product keeps them on real tight. prevents theft and looks good on the car. and the key ring is a nice touch to
1937,1,water get thru bike gets all wet had to get another brand and stile .Did not care for it at all
1938,5,"I have a Marantz DC garage door opener and it's is very quiet, but the noise from the garage door moving on the tracks was driving me crazy.  After WD40 and other lubricants didn't work, got the CRC White Lithium grease and applied it.  The noise was reduced to a bare minimum.  A must have if you have a garage.  I have also used this on door hinges, van sliding door, etc.  Works great!!"
1939,5,"They look great on my 2010 Accord Coupe and they are just as bright as the stockers. Their lightbulbs, what else can I say?"
1940,5,6000 k looks amazing I was very pleased with the fast shipping and price of this ballast. I highly reccomend this over my old XENON ballasts that I bought.
1941,5,Air cool your hands and dissipate engine vibration with these grips.  I haven't taken them for a long ride but that throttle boss makes it more comfortable already just ridding around town.  Add an end cap of your choice to add some flair.
1942,5,"Great brake line. Easy to cut, route & flare. A lot easier to work with than steel brake line. The best thing is that it will never rust. We have about a dozen snow plow trucks & are always replacing brake lines. Sometimes we are replacing the same lines every 2-3 years. Even the coated lines rust out eventually & are harder to work with. I believe that with this new copper/nickle line, I will never have to replace the new lines again. Highly recommended product."
1943,1,"Why would you make an LED running light and not make it water proof, two days after installation and already water in them and leds out i will be returning this crap"
1944,5,serves its purpose<br />purchased two boxes for my boat it came with everything to mount<br />would recommend and purchase again
1945,4,do your research - most UPS use the same battery with different Model Numbers - this was exactly the same as the one I replaced
1946,5,"Received on Jan 06, 2014, installed and in use. Glad I finally got a gas cap. I don't think ford's better idea was in my interest. Ford's way of cutting their cost."
1947,4,"This part fit well, went on as it should have and seems to work well over bumps. It is not a performance strut just a solid replacement option at a good price.<br /><br />TIP: Don't forget to move the rubber seats from the old strut as this does not come with them and you will get excess noise with out them. You also may need a new boot and mount"
1948,1,"Comes as words printed on a clear piece of plastic. I have bought these in the past, and its supposed to be individually cutout letters..... its not... I wont be buying from this seller again"
1949,5,"I recommend to anyone needing a replacement coil,very good quality part that worked right first time,bright blue spark,easy install,will work on most any bike"
1950,4,"Very true to size, for the man who loves his GTI, Great true black, and nice large plaid letters with Red lines."
1951,4,It is really well made but you pay for the well made. I have two of these on hot rods and not sure how much they cool but they do add capacity and are not a piece of thin chrome junk.
1952,5,It works like it said. I got 3 miles more to my jeep after adding this. I will buy it again for my next oil change.
1953,5,I have used product for many years.  I absolutely knew it would be great gift. Will use as great gift in the future.
1954,5,"Blends well with my wife's 2013 Dodge 4x4.  Easy to install, Sturdy mount.  Great product for the money.  Best of all, the wife loves it."
1955,3,"A lot bigger than what I expected, it fits really big and a little too hard to handle. Still have it, don't know if I'll ever use it again though."
1956,5,"The gauge has everything that I expected and more, display is large enough for me, very easy to install and no set up needed. I like the options of viewing any display I want to in 4 different windows. I works in all my ford vehicles and I have not tried on Honda but the instructions say that will work with all those cars.<br />Amazon had a good price on the gauge and ship very fast also at no charge. What else can you ask for?"
1957,5,"these floor mats fit perfectly in my 2013 honda fit. they were exactly what i was looking for: mats that weren't carpet, easy to clean, and sturdy."
1958,5,I work in an underground coal mine. The crimper works great. It really takes some abuse from a 4 pound hammer.
1959,4,"Delivery was great.  Product is high quality and works great.  Unit is sent with a jack shaft screw that is 1/4&#34; diameter with 10/32 fine threads.  This screw will not insert into the smaller jack shaft coming through the wall of the inner drive chain housing on my 95 FLTCU.  I had to go to a dealer to get the correct jack shaft screw. ($19.00).  Would be nice of All Balls to send both size screws, or at least notify you of the size of the screw prior to shipping."
1960,5,I've used this on several rusted parts on my front end during a rebuild and it works really well.  The best part is that it makes for a paintable surface.  Don't forget to buy some flux brushes to use for applying it.  You can buy them in the plumbing section of Home Depot or on Amazon.  You'll also want to have a disposable plastic container to pour some in.
1961,5,Great Key Chain.  Holds Keys very well.  The item is as described and is great quality.  My wife loves it!
1962,3,"This thing is amazing, it shreds through ice and snow on your car.  The only complaint I have is the plastic piece that connects to metal bars together.  You twist it to elongate the scraper to reach ice easier, the plastic used is VERY CHEAP and broke on my second use.  If they had made this piece of stronger plastic or better yet metal this would deserve a 5.  I still use it but I can't make it any longer or the pieces fall apart."
1963,4,"Worked very well on stubborn toilet stains, but not the staining on the vinyl tub surround.  Overall, a good investment."
1964,5,We were looking for something to keep our trailer safe and my next door naighbor have one. We already know that it will work regardless.
1965,4,"Great product for minor scratches, not for major ones. Just make sure you take your time and don't over use it."
1966,5,It was exactly what i ordered works perfectly can't really find any complaints myself it was in perfect condition just as it should be and works pretty good.
1967,5,"The first thing i did with this puller kit is run a bottom tap on the extensions and bearing separators, and a a die on all the threaded shafts. The next thing i did was replace the bearing separated nuts with some from ace hardware that are steel and Rockwell rated. I then coated everything with silicone lubricate. I have now pulled bearings off dc mothers, axle shafts, CV joints. I have used it about twenty times in a short period of time without any problems or failures. I think i save a lot of money overall by doing these few things."
1968,4,"It was a very useful for flexible packing. I used it on a 40 degree day and it withstood well. Never tried it on a rainy day. Hope it will work okay. Overall, the product is worth for following reasons<br />1. flexible - packing, removing etc.,<br />2. value for money - worthwhile investment even it works for 4 - 5 years.<br />3. Aero dynamic design (not sure whether it was tested for it). However, the shape suggests it was built with considerations for aero dynamics. On my Toyota Avalon V6, I got reasonably good mileage (~10ltrs/100kms) with additional load of ~60kgs (30kgs on roof rack, 30 kgs in boot) + 4 people inside car - ~200kgs.<br /><br />Non-product related:<br />The postage for international dispatch was expensive."
1969,5,Better don a life vest because ur gettin soaked fella! I mean you better grip your paddle TIGHT and hold on buddy ! This freshener will bash your skull on the rocks and the river will run red with your blood Mr.MAN!
1970,5,I have been switching to bio based oils for about a year now in my business the ultra-lube line is wonderful.
1971,5,this is a must have product. all of brake issue went away an my 2006 Titan stops on a dime quietly. many thanks
1972,5,"Works like it's supposed to. Good solid construction. I got so many in the box I wished I was Bender so I could snack on them (I only needed 5 - but that's today's world - Home Centers drive real, but small, stores out of business, but don't carry what you need)."
1973,5,"Shipping was fast, and instructions for installing the roll-up cover were very easy to understand.  Took about 45 minutes to install after dusk.  Seals perfectly and no amount of rain/snow leaks into the bed.  About 4&#34; of rain in one day, and 10&#34; of snow on another day, and the bed of the truck was still dry."
1974,5,This front bumper makes my 04 kfx 700 look like the beast it was made to. It has definitely inspired me to get the dg fat series skid plates to match. I love my kfx:)
1975,4,The mats look nice and seem to be good quality they are just a little to small but only about half inch but that's not a big deal so I would recommend them.
1976,5,"I found my new love! I bought a used car and the carpets were heavily stained. Oh my god, I sprayed the white foam and I saw the stain immediately lifted off. I didn't use the brush that came with it, I used the rotating brush accessory from my steam cleaner instead which made scrubbing easier. I would recommend this product. It left my carpets looking like brand new!"
1977,5,This is the second pair i have ordered from this company. I have a jeep and Mitsubishi which now both have these rain guards
1978,5,I bought it for my son.  He had it installed in no time and made a big difference when he is driving at night.
1979,5,"I bought this because the PCV valve on my 2011 F150 was damaged by an errant wrench.<br /><br />There was an aftermarket part that was marginally cheaper, but not enough to make a difference.  As the OEM part, it fits perfectly and seems to be working."
1980,5,"I had read the reviews and thought...well we'll see.<br />The light these produce is absolutely amazing on such little amp draw.<br />I hooked them up to a short wire pair and some alligator clips to test on arrival, and use these now solely around the garage...to give more light to my projects. They have totally replaced those heavy, hot halogen shop lights I had....they are brighter, and cooler, and so I've swapped them out on my halogen light stand.  Small drawback is I need to leave a battery tender on the 12v battery...but once they turn off, it's charged up in less than 30 seconds.  Great for taking photo's....SO now I now need another set for the original project. I have dropped them, or they have fallen off a table perhaps 4 times...and they still work perfectly.  SOLID.<br />Very SOLID. Not lightweight but stout lights. They produce a \\""whiter\\"" light, than incandescent...not necessarily pleasing to the eye ....but if you need bright light...these are the ticket. Very pleased.<br />I suppose if there is a negative...is that if you are walking toward the lights....at night...you are pretty much blinded....and need to put your hand up to block the source or you'll run into something unintended. They are really really bright."
1981,5,looks great an I got it for a good deal and I will be buying more products from them I highly recommend them to anybody
1982,1,Not perfessional at all. It wasn't even cut evenly.i was going to give as a funny gift and it looks like my 6 year old made it
1983,5,"Quality looks good out of the box, and I was provided with very clear installation instructions with picture reference.  Great overall product, although I would not recommend the Dorman passenger glass.  It has distorted vision though the glass and my replacement had the same issue."
1984,5,"Works very well and easy to install. Much cheaper than a dealer and again, very nice price for an OEM filter."
1985,4,"Good part.  I had one at 50k and one at 130k that I replaced with these.  A side note:  The picture is NOT of the actual part.  The actual part has silver 10.9 studs, and no dust seal."
1986,5,Love this thing. Have used it on too many jobs to count. The thing has paid for itself several times over.
1987,1,"Installed these on my 2011 Cadillac SRX &#34;Luxury&#34;  Very difficult installation I must say-  There was no significant<br />increase in visibility on the road.  The OEM lights were just as good and not so blue.  In my opinion the blue tint is<br />a vanity option and does not actually illuminate better.  Cadillac just made an inferior product, will not admit<br />it is defective and the dealers claim it is OK.  Don't waste your $$$  Complain to a Cadillac Dealer"
1988,5,"New and came with the install gasket.  Mounted on 5HP engine, connected to fuel line and primer line, turned each adjustment screw out 1-1/2 turns and engine started on the second pull!!"
1989,5,I love this! With the heat and winter weather I don't have to worry about my vehicle being protected. Doesn't take me long to polish my car and keeps my white RX 330 looking new. People think it's new - little do they know it's 7 year old.
1990,5,"I particularly like the with flexibility both in cold weather (not coiling up) and when attached to the nailer.  I can unwind the poly hoses and get them to lay flat on the floor, but this one, just toss it out there and it is flat on the ground with no annoying loops that you have to step over."
1991,5,am sure it will increase the life of my car tire and fuel efficiency<br />Good luck and thanks<br /><br />Nishad<br />Jeddah
1992,5,"This has been very hard to find, but very reasonably priced for the remote alone, let alone the key.  Thanks"
1993,5,"I purchased these emblems to replace my car's domed wheelcenters. Please note that they are thin metal and curved, so they CANNOT be adhered to a flat surface. They however fit perfectly on top of the domed wheelcenters, just be sure you clean the surface to avoid any grease or dust before installing the Alfa Romeo logo. Vivid true colors. I only hope the glue is strong enough to hold the emblem in place for a long time."
1994,5,Excellent product. Great price. Parts arrived very fast and fit like the OEM. I have installed the door handle and it looks like new
1995,5,You can't go wrong with original replacement parts. The replacement choke cap worked and fit perfectly. The shipping was quick and the price was right.
1996,4,"Quality good but it needs to be a couple inches bigger to fit correctly over a 77 new yorker.  A bit too tight on the corners and I'm concerned over time the car will poke a hole through, at least on the front corners.  Last cover I had from different manufacturer had same material but was a bit bigger."
1997,5,"I recommend using this with a high spray wash like at those self-serve car washes. After you scrub the foam a bit, it gets all of the junk off your wheels, and ours were really, really dirty."
1998,4,"I wanted to find a reuseable mask to filter out gunpowder and dust particles while at the range or at outdoor events.  The color matched my gear, and the fit what pretty good. One Velcro patch on the back, the front black strip has a metal wire, that you can mold to you nose, stays in place pretty good.  Also allows room for ear protection. I like it, and it is washable."
1999,1,"I would not recommend you purchase this product or any product from this seller unless you are VERY certain you want the product as the return policy is incredibly restrictive. These types of products generally take trying a time or two in order to determine if they work for your situation, and in this case, that time or two may put you past the return time allowed by the seller.<br />We ordered these ramps on November 3rd, anticipating our move out of our home on November 15th and into our new home on November 23rd. Our newly purchased home has four entry steps, and we were hoping the ramps would allow for our dear friend to come into our new house as he is confined to a wheelchair. We moved into our new house on November 23rd, and the ramps will not work for the reason we ordered. They are just too steep. We were over the 30 day return because we were trying to be organized and think ahead when ordering, but then didn't even move in until three weeks later. In moving out, staying in transition housing and then moving in, our lives were chaotic, and it took us another couple of weeks to begin to be settled. There was nothing at all wrong with the ramps--they would probably be great for the intended purpose of loading and unloading, but not for our hoped-for-purpose of getting a person in a wheelchair into our new home.<br /><br />When I inquired about returning the ramps, this was the reply I received, “Unfortunately, we do not accept returns after 30 days.” As mentioned above, we ordered the ramps on November 3rd, and I inquired about returning on December 9th, less than a week past the 30 day return window and was denied. While the 30 day return policy is compliant with Amazon sellers, this seems to be the minimum return policy that Amazon allows sellers to have. I have, in fact, returned items to Amazon later than 30 days and had the items accepted without question.  When I replied back to Ramp King that my review would reflect their response, I received another email suggesting that I would be “vindictive” by giving negative feedback in a review. I do not believe I am being vindictive; I believe I am being honest. I have ordered hundreds of items through Amazon and have never given a negative review. I have generally found Amazon and its sellers to be easy to work with, and I am concerned about an expensive purchase such as these ramps being restricted to such a narrow return policy. I think it is only right for potential buyers to know up front about this concern.<br /><br />What if this item had been a Christmas gift? Obviously no exchange if it didn’t work—I think that is a problem. This item was not a Christmas gift, but I am still frustrated by the response. In addition, if a person were to order these ramps for the purpose of loading an ATV r something along those lines, it could theoretically take a week or two or three before a person was able to get out with the ATV’s and try the ramps to see if they worked well. By that time, a buyer could easily be past the 30 day return window. With something as “heavy-duty” as these ramps, one would presume they would be of durable quality such that trying out the product and determining it would not work for the buyer’s purpose within 60 or 90 days even, would not cause damage to the product."
2000,5,This looks fantastic on the front of the Jaguar. It had to be attached by a professional but well worth it.
2001,5,Purchased this adapter to be able to easily flush drain hose before storing in motorhome basement storage compartment. When finished flushing this will also cap off to prevent leaking when stored.
2002,5,This unit is invaluable to my son the photographer. He takes it out in the field with him at night to do long exposure star trails and the unit runs both of the heat strips he wraps around his lens and camera to keep it warm. The other night it was 14 degrees out and it kept the heat strips warm for 5 hours! Love it and it shipped so fast.
2003,5,I bought these for my Mustang wheels which lost a couple of caps.  They arrived quickly and were perfect.  Just the excellent finish for my hot rod.  Very happy with the purchase and will keep this company on my 'go to' list.  I really appreciate professionalism and great customer service and was very satisfied with with all aspects of this purchase.
2004,5,"Best spotlights ever, nothing else compares. Look good and incredibly bright making for safer driving.  You can buy cheaper but a false economy."
2005,5,Independent testing results revealed that this was the best value oil filter on the market.  Well made on the inside.
2006,5,These mats fit great and are easy to clean. It was nice to finally find mats that fit as advertised.
2007,2,"Did not fasten to anything, it just stilts on the floor and tips over. Also it is very large and takes up a lot of room."
2008,5,"Great condition, it isn't made out of cheap material and it was the perfect length. I would recommend it to anyone, thank you!"
2009,4,"I RIDE YEAR ARROUND.  THESE ARE TRUE TO FIT. NO &#34;HOT SPOTS&#34; NOTED AT ANY SETTING.  THEY'RE WARM UNTIL TEMPS OF &#60;30° F, THEN I HAVE TO USE GORE TEX MITTS FOR ADDED SHIELDING.  THE FEINGER TIPS DON'T HEAT AS EFFICIENTLY AS THE PALM, KNUCKLE, AND DORSAL SURFACES DO - UNLESS SETTING IS ON MAX."
2010,5,Kits has a lot to offer in spring choices.  Was exactly what o needed to get mey boat up and running rite
2011,5,"I gained +positive performance, after changing my stock tires of my 2012 4x4 ford expedition from Pirelli 255/70/R18 to Michelin 275/65/R18, the car went a bit slower than before, but after I installed this filter it seems my car received more air ratio. Much better shift firmness. I am so happy and thinking to buy more stuff from K&N"
2012,4,It is both a good safety measure and a driving comfort.<br />a good value for the purchase price.<br /><br />I've been using it daily for about o9ne month.
2013,5,The product produces a  very white light that makes road markings and signs stand out. The installation was  plug and play so it was very quick and easy.  The price was the best available and free two day prime shipping sealed the deal.
2014,5,"This sissy bar was shipped and received very quickly from Big Bad Power Sports. Leading up to my order, they very promptly answered an email question I had and helped me decide this sissy would work well. This Cobra unit was beefy, installation was simple (just 8 bolts), and took about 10 minutes.  It looks great on my VTX 1300R, is solid, and my wife loves the wider backrest pad and slightly higher position on this model. Perfect."
2015,2,"I have 2008 cts and this cover does not fit well at all, to small it is more for a small car not a midsize"
2016,2,"The part pictured is correct and that's the one I needed. But the assembly I received WAS NOT! It is the wrong orientation, with the wrong bracket and actuator lever. If not in a hurry, I would have returned it. However, the valve itself has screw holes on both sides, which makes it reversible. So I was able to disassemble and install it with my original assembly to make it work. I bought from Amazon, at a higher price, because I needed it fast (it was) and the picture is clearly the correct part. However, I'd buy elsewhere if I had to do it over."
2017,1,"I wouldn't trust the seller at this point. I purchased the coil overs and received H-tech springs. Not saying they're bad springs but there's a bit of a price difference and if I wanted springs, I would've just bought springs. Extreme downer and now I have to look elsewhere for new suspension. Really wouldn't recommend buying from this seller. Best part of purchase was UPS was at my door next day to take the springs back free of charge"
2018,5,I ordered these on Monday...came Wednesday! fit like a glove! So glad I ordered! I will order third row and the cargo liner next! I had emailed Husky liners to ask them a few questions and they responded so quickly.  Good customer service!
2019,5,"Perfect fit, looks good and works well.  Comes with self sealing port for attaching to the Jeep floor mat (OEM) retainer.  Buy with confidence as it works well."
2020,5,"I followed the instructions included, making sure to clean the area and then apply the decal. It went on easily and was perfect! What more could you ask for from a vinyl decal?"
2021,5,Great cleaning action. Water sheets off the vehicle nicely after using this product. This product is very concentrated and it only takes a couple cap fulls to fill a 3 gallon wash bucket with a nice sudsy mixture.
2022,5,Money well spent. Makes the difficult job of reinstalling the door spring very easy and safe. Highly recommend this tool.
2023,1,It does not work for a dodge ram 1500 year 1999 it won't fit in the bracket so do your home work frist
2024,5,"I drive a convertible, and my wife had problems with dust, etc. blowing in her eyes and causing problems with her contact lenses;<br />these sunglasses solved the problem.  Also, these are light, attractive, and comfortable; I also use them when the sun shines<br />into my peripheral vision."
2025,5,"I used this on the front of my duck boat, so far so good.  It seems to be durable, the dog hasn't broken it yet.  I've used it a hand full of times in the snow and hail and it works great.  Better than expected."
2026,4,"This is a really nice quality vest. The material seems very durable and looks nice. However, the vest runs a little small. Be sure to order 1-2 sizes up from what you would normally order because you will be paying your own postage on the return."
2027,5,It was an exact replacement for my 6.5 hp Briggs carborator. Everything was identical to the carborator it replaced. Works perfectly and saved my hundreds on the cost of a new lawn mower.
2028,5,These are great for a half helmet when riding motorcycles. Got one for my wife and ended up putting one on my helmet as well.
2029,4,"Good fit, and helps keep filter clean so it can go longer between cleanings. It is great if you live in a sandy environment."
2030,5,"It does EXACTLY what I need it to.<br /><br />Bought a 'new' towed car, it had a Roadmaster baseplate on it but I have an Aventa II towbar.<br /><br />This adapted them just fine."
2031,4,It provides a lot more light than the factory installed dome lights.  A nice bright blue light that lights up the interior of the vehicle.
2032,4,"I used this on a polyester (soft fabric) inner shower curtain. It works. It does not discolor the fabric. Is it permanent?<br /><br />No. What else can I say? Follow the directions carefully. Best use is on jackets, sofas, patio furniture and umbrellas. Too much constant water will defeat this. It is not some magic oil that will seal a life raft. It just makes your stuff &#34;mostly&#34; waterproof for a while. I was hoping for better results but now that I know its limitations I am happy with it. Use it on things that get splashed with water and you will be amazed; use it on things that get soaked and you will be amazed and then disappointed. It doesn't smell very much either. Best to do it out doors."
2033,5,I got 80 thousand miles on my first set of Rancho Shocks (F150 4 x 4)...I abused the hell out of them (off road and hauling overloaded trailers and loads in the bed) and they performed great all the way to the end...I swapped them out when I noticed the truck leaning excessively when merging on tight freeway on ramps and other tight turns.  I purchased and installed these without any problems...truck is firm again...just like new.
2034,5,"I'm very happy with the fit and finish, as well as the ease of installation. I'm would recommend this product."
2035,5,"This is why you buy an italian made leather wheel. Because it is flawless.<br />I am very very impressed on how well this was made/stitched.<br /><br />This drifting wheel is stitched different than every other wheel out there.<br />There isn't any visible stitches on the wheel, so you can slide the wheel around<br />easier while drifting.<br /><br />DO NOT get an ebay wheel. They have MOMO Drift knock off wheels on there.<br />DO NOT GET ONE. If you can see stitching on the inside of the wheel it is fake.<br />You can bend them in half without barley any effort. Think of how that translates into steering?<br />You could honestly die with one of those 60$ ebay wheels. The wheel itself isn't strong enough<br />to withstand the forces of a hard bump.<br />The real one is rock solid though."
2036,5,I bought these for riding horses because I like to feel the reins with my actual fingers.  I think these actually warm the blood in your hand before heading on down to your fingers because my hands weren't cold anymore after using them!  Probably used them in about 30 degrees farenheit.
2037,5,"because since we started using it we have not had any problems with our 6.0 ford. we were told by a mechanic in las vegas it would add life to our engine and we&#34;re up to 172,000 miles no problems and its running great. it is worth the money. thanks"
2038,5,"Best price found anywhere, Factory fit & finish. Will buy again if another repair  ever is needed for Montero Sport."
2039,5,Great stools for the shop! They are a conversation piece and they are so comfortable for guests who stop by. They have held up well and we would certainly recommend them to others.
2040,1,"Not a great cargo net. The knots that weave the net together are very very loose right out of the package. Once you pull all of them together you have a massive net that has no elasticity. I'd say I am disappointed, but I half expected a crappy net considering the price I paid.<br /><br />I'd look elsewhere...I cannot recommend this."
2041,5,The gasket arrived in perfect condition. It worked fine. It has been a couple of weeks and I've had no leaks.
2042,1,"It takes a very good handy man to install them, even had to put washers in the light to keep them from breaking through the lamp  box.  All in all, Cheep, Cheep, Cheep product, but for the price, well, I say it could be much less to be worth it. The lights beam is OK."
2043,3,"I should have read the reviews first. I, too, thought this was an OEM VW part, but it's not. Just another Chinese-made knock-off. The quality isn't as great as the OEM part. Less reinforcment. In fact, when it arrived (it was shipped IN A BAG - ZERO padding, protection, etc.), it had a few broken tabs. It fits my 2002 Jetta GLS 1.8t decently enough, though, and for $30, I suppose you really can't expect much."
2044,3,it is a filter that works like it is supposed to so there is not much else to say about that
2045,3,Smaller than expected but I will use it on a trailer instead of where planned.  I am not sure it would meet DOT requirements for a commercial vehicle.
2046,5,Came in simple pack which shows &#34;Made in Germany&#34;. Easy to fit - just push it in and it locks itself in.
2047,4,The only thing stopping me from rating this a 5/5 was the fact that the decal is not transparent and is a little difficult to see through tinted windows. However its size and image of Mr. J is super awesome and a great find for fans of the animated series. I have batman seat covers on my little car and having the Clown Prince of Crime on it makes it ten times better to drive. :)
2048,2,It broke while putting it on! It Just snapped.....we made it work with tie straps though. It does its job.
2049,5,I always thought ever car comes with a gas cap but I guess wrong. For the price you get a lock with this one. Fits perfect
2050,4,Came quickly and it fit and works and looks great. The electrical conection didn't match what I had but I made it work.
2051,4,"Good product. It matches the bolt that it replaces in the my Jeep.Good replacement part. Interesting, since it's described as a GM part and I placed it in a Jeep."
2052,5,this is a awesome tool and if you have internet service it gives a very good exp of the codes !
2053,5,Great wish it had the relay probes with it though.  It does make using the power probe easier. Thank you
2054,5,"This air intake kit plus a new set of NGK BKR6EIX Iridium IX Spark Plug did turned  my old but very well kept truck into a missile. The kit is a perfect fit for my truck, not loud at all and It did past my wife's Ears approval (Praise the Lord). I simply love it. It's well made, not expensive and  It produce great acceleration."
2055,2,Broke within the week that I ended up getting it. I do plan on getting a new one.  It is just too darn cute.
2056,4,"Replaced the filter in my S40.  The  K&N filter feels well made, and fit nicely into the filter box.  Subjectively I wouldn't say I've noticed any power gain, though the engine maybe sounds a bit louder.  I have no hard data on either of those things.  The filter is reusable, but does require a special cleaning oil as opposed to just being something you can rinse out."
2057,3,"I thought drivers would noticed but didn't coz it's too small and they didn't care, ugh! And there's no other words for me to say..."
2058,5,"A note to help future installers.  The rings are press fit over the heat tubes. A 3\\"" diameter piece of plastic pipe works well. Place it over the ring and \\""press\\"" the ring on the tube by tapping lightly around the edge of the pipe with a hammer.  This will secure the cover pan on the tank. Good luck"
2059,5,"The first one I ordered came severely damaged so after contacting Amazon, they sent a replacement with no extra charge. This paint was admired by my co-workers and fortunately for my car, I only need 1 quart."
2060,5,"The part was identical to the picture, very good packaging.  I trust this brand now and am ready to continue purchasing from this company. Great service and quality!"
2061,5,it came complete bolts frame pieces wires brackets and it was a perfect fit not struggling and new plastic easy to change
2062,4,These were installed with no problems on my '01 Infiniti I30t. I replaced the boots and plugs when I had the valve cover and intake manifold gaskets replaced. The only comment I have is the picture on Amazon is not accurate. The description is fine though. This is a set of 6 Coil Over Plug Boots. It comes with 3 boots for each side of the engine and the springs that go inside the boots. If you are replacing the spark plugs with the boots be sure to use OEM plugs. For the '01 Infiniti I30t and Maxima they are the NGK 2647 Laser Platinum plugs.
2063,5,These rear mud flaps look great and are so easy to install. It took about 5 min to install both sides.
2064,5,"I had visited my local bike shops looking for chaps, cheapest pair I found was $90 and those left something to be desired. When I saw these on Amazon I figured I was getting the same thing. NOPE.  These chaps feel like $150 chaps. I am very impressed. They are warm and waterproof ( morning after I got them it was 44 and raining. Had to try them out..lol). Hardest part was sizing. I sized myself at the local shops and ordered that way. I am 6 ft, 171lb, and skinny. I wear a 32waste and 34 inseam size jean and measure 23\\"" around my thigh with jeans on. I got a large, a little loose around the waste, but perfect length. I like that. Don't be afraid to purchase these."
2065,5,"Not only did it get here quicker than I expected, it fit perfectly!  Product was exactly as described and matched perfectly."
2066,5,"These went on in just a few minutes,but i t took a little longer to set the angle of the heel rests(very nice option) . After riding about 70  miles in one day,I have decided that these pegs have made my bike more rider friendly,my feet stayed awake and the ride was solid ,not buzzy,all day.They look so good,I had to order the set with footpegs and a shifter peg so it all matches.Probably the best money I've spent on my 96 Sportster 1200S since I bought it"
2067,5,I have a MkV Jetta TDi and this installs perfectly.  Comes with a new o-ring for the filter housing cap.
2068,5,"As the product description states, these are high quality tools and not cheap plastic. I've used two of the five tools in order to remove some interior trim and they worked great. At less than $20 for the set, it's a fairly good value. Highly recommended."
2069,1,"These gloves look pretty cool online and seem to have all the features I was looking for, and the price was right. When you actually get them you can really tell the quality is not quite there is you've ever seen real motorcycle gloves but they seemed good enough. The problem is the seems inside are very large and not really comfortable. The knuckle protector doesn't quite fit right and is too narrow.<br /><br />The biggest problem though are the vents finger protector. They are poorly placed and hard inside. They cut into your finger everytime you move or bend.<br /><br />I went from trying to get a deal to being forced to buy another pair of gloves. Spend the extra few dollars and get a real brand,"
2070,5,fit perfectly in my truck! not only looks great but functions good as well. no complains here! will hopefully buy more from you.
2071,5,Read about this in the car forums. Gave it a go and I'm really have with it. I have nothing else to spray down. I use it twice a month. And still have plenty left.
2072,4,"Haven't found a spot for it yet, but I'm saving it.  Like all the Gemz products as I have a few of them.  must be careful as the stones will fall out, so coat with clear nail polish for longer durability."
2073,5,This mattress works great in our renovated 1958 Garwood trailer.  Great support.  Love it!  We have owned a variety of RV's and this mattress really gave us the comfort we were looking for in a mattress.  Very pleased with this purchase.
2074,5,Installs in seconds which I guess is more Honda than this but it fit as intended and no issues.  Pricing was better than anything I found locally.
2075,5,"Finish is good and looks great!<br />The marker is a little smaller than most, but I actually like it because it's smaller."
2076,4,"Works well with a 12v power source. Easy to install with self adhesive backing. Appears to be bright enough for signal use, but ideal for accent lighting."
2077,1,junk i guess we got these to be legal however the magnet that is suppose to hold them to the car are weak and the lights fall off and break on the road.
2078,1,"This stuff is essentially PAM in a Rainx labeled can. Doesn't clean that well, leaves streaks, and doesn't repel water at all. Driving after applying is less safe than when my windshield was dirty."
2079,5,I'm very happy with this item. It is installed at a school in rural Haiti where there is no power other than generators. Really like the LED efficiency and I'm amazed how bright it turned out to be.
2080,1,Not in this case.  Very cheaply made and larger than the average cover.  Not my favorite item.  The packaging leaves a lot to be desired as well.
2081,3,The Maradyne MC162K looks to be made of quality material.  After installing and testing the fan has an excessive vibration.  I have tried to contact Maradyne customer support to tell them about my concern of fan longivity due to excessive out of balance condition but they will not respond.  Maradyne states in the description of their fans that they are all balanced but the one  I purchased definitly was not balanced correctly.
2082,5,I bought this kit for my 2000 Honda Civic due to the headlights being very yellowed and fogged.  I read a product review on Consumer reports that rated this the fastest and most effective.  I cannot believe how well it worked.  It took about 4 steps of buffing and 30 minutes (with two of us working on each head light) but it worked perfectly.  Highly recommend.
2083,5,"Boat shop charged me $100 for 3 min to pull my part of the boat , now I can do it myself anytime I want , whenever I need it done , great puller and easy to use , will save me $1000s at today's shop prices"
2084,1,"I'm a long haul trucker and rely on 12 volt product. For years I've used a coleman 12 volt \\""powerchill\\"" cooler for my refrigerator and an Engel MT45F for my freezer. The Engel works great for years keeping my food frozen in my truck nonstop. The coleman cooler does ok but last a year with constant use and I got tired on having to buy a new one each year so I decided to try the ARB 50 quart. I was thoroughly disappointed in its performance. It was constantly shutting down due to 12 volt power supply not adequate for it to operate when my other units where not having any problem. I'm going to go back to using the \\""yearly disposable\\"" coleman 12 volt cooler for my truck refrigerator and keep the ARB at home gathering dust."
2085,5,I read the two reviews that these were for the window and not the hatch door as described and since the window was what I was looking for I ordered them. They work perfectly. Amazon needs to pay attention to our reviews and make corrections. I was very satisfied with them.
2086,5,"I bought this snazzy little decal to tell the world about my new baby girl. I had a suction cup one previously but no one could see it due to our tinted windows. This one goes on the outside of the window so it didn't have that problem. Applying the decal was very simple and it came with instructions. The size is perfect. It's a little bigger than the palm of my hand so it doesn't get in the way of the rear view mirror but it's still easily viewable. The bright pink also gives it a lot of visibility. So far it has survived a rain season with lots of hail, dirt, and window washing. Quite durable.  I have received many compliments about the decal and would definitely recommend it."
2087,5,"Was a bit of a pain to change out but it is working fine, no problems for a couple of months now.  No complaints."
2088,2,"The hardware for this seat is definitely not! D.O.T approved.<br />The front mounts are sloppy in fit and the welding on the pin barrels do Not look safe.<br />The rear mount does not even sit flush to the floor, 1 ¼” gap.<br />Be prepared to make your own mounts.<br />Or spring for the wrecking yard OEM you’ll even get the seat belt.<br />The seat material and frame was what I expected &#34;Good&#34;, there is a problem of a wear point<br />at the front mount where it connects to the seat, they make you cut into the seat fabric to expose<br />a connection point.<br />Good Luck"
2089,5,"This was a birthday gift for our granddaughter.  She loves owls and I knew she would love this one.  Just the right size, not too long so it won't get caught in anything.  It's really nice!"
2090,5,"Fit perfectly. Well made, and works like a dream .A great product at a great price.Much better than I expected for the price !"
2091,5,"It's handy to be able to order brand-name parts online and have them delivered to my door.  These calipers appear to be of very good quality, even though re-manufactured.  They were the right part for this vehicle and installed easily with no problems.  Additionally, the price was good."
2092,5,These GTI badges look great and fit great!! Good product! Looks like it came stock! high quality! I recommend these and they are cheap.
2093,4,"It looks unexpectedly thin when I receive it.However, the size is just fitting with the filter housing. Some black carton powder can be seen.  Already installed, but not able to see the difference before and after installation."
2094,5,installed on my avalanche in less than 20 minutes. easy install. look great. i recommend. first time i used in channel
2095,2,"0. Review based on a 2000 VW Golf GTI GLX, 126xxx miles on it, well maintained.<br />1.These pre-assembled struts made a easy installation. The price are great, and the overall build quality are good (springs, strut. internal valves measured by riding quality).<br />2. According to Bentley service manual, when install the front struts, impact wrench should be avoided. Using a special service tool and a hex bit on a torque wrench holding the inner stem, I want to tighten them to 44 lb ft. It turned out that the center stem broke. On the other side, I found the center stem can only hold up to 30 lb ft, beyond which it will strip. Without other choice, I used an impact wrench to tighten them (wired tool, thus strong).<br />3. I live with them through the summer (3 months 1500 miles), and they feels fine (similar to the OEM Sachs). Still seriously concerned about safety (stem fastening to strut tower can only hold 30 lb ft, and if that break at 65mph...), I replaced them with a reputable brand. Did feel a improvement of driving quality immediately."
2096,5,"Worker perfect.  Installed it myself in 30 minutes.  Saved hunders of $.<br /><br />If you are careful, you can do it without even removing teh window."
2097,5,"I don't have the patience to wet-sand by hand, so I am thrilled with this product. It is much more effective than the Mother's Powerball for Headlights I tried before.<br /><br />Basically, if you know that you NEED to clean your headlights, this is the kit for you."
2098,5,I love this license plate frame. It fit perfectly on my car and the metal that they used to make it is great. I read some reviews that said you could see the white of the license plate but it was no problem you can see some of it pop out but only if you are really close to the license plate so its no big deal. :)
2099,2,"I am OCD about taking care of and cleaning everything i own, especially my car.  Usually i buy the yellow microfiber pack they sell at Costco but decided to give this one a try due to subscribe and save 15% additional discount.  I was very disappointed because these do not absorb ANY liquid and do not do the job, do not buy these for car washing, i ended up using almost 1/4 for one car wash and it still left streaks and leftover water.  Stick with the costco one"
2100,5,Pros:<br />Installed easily and was a perfect fit for my 23 year old car mating properly with AP tailpile<br /><br />Cons:<br />None so far
2101,4,"The tool worked exceptionally well for a first time user. It took several attempts to work the device and the tool performed just as advertised. I plan on keeping my truck so the tool will be added to my tool box, a must have for Ford owners"
2102,5,"Item just as described, arrived quickly, good quality, would recommend the item. Was a gift for my daughter and she wears it almost every day!"
2103,4,These gloves look and feel great on my hands. They wick away sweat very good and feel great during each and every ride
2104,5,Awesome!  Looks like my car was created by the Allspark!  They are just the right size for a car.  they sick great and have gone through many car washes
2105,5,"Prompt delivery, product is as advertised. Helpful when you have a student driver to stick on your car as needed."
2106,5,If you plan to use these just remember you will have to at least loosen the trailer hitch to gain access to the top shackle bolt.
2107,4,I have used these a couple times over the past few days and must say they are great tools. I have not scratched either vehicle I used them on.
2108,5,"Totally like these mats. Fit nicely in our suv. Contour well with minimal trimming. Look good, don't slip, and hardly any smell."
2109,5,I had ordered these when I got my motorcycle over a year ago.  I broke the dark ones after about 8 months of use so I ordered a different type and was experiencing wind in my eyes causing me to tear up.  I still had my clear ones and realized that I wasn't having that problem so I ordered these again and am glad I did.
2110,4,Screws right into a quart sized bottle and I used this to pump 2 quarts into my transmission. It doesn't move much fluid with each pump BUT for the price it;s worth it.
2111,2,"You get what you pay for. This same item would likely cost considerably less elsewhere. These were bent, did not fit properly nor &#34;molded to fit my car&#34; as advertised so I had to re-engineer them for a close but not perfect fit, mostly because I did not want to go through the hassle and expense of sending them back in exchange for more cheap junk. I suspect that one could find a higher quality than these."
2112,5,"I was originally sent 1 left shoe, but the seller made it right and sent the right shoe in priority mail. So overall i'm happy with the product and service. The shoes seem well made, i just hope they protect my feet sufficiently when/if i get an a accident."
2113,3,was not sure how to use any of these. they didn't come with instructions on how to use them or what to do. was a little disappointed but the little screwdriver has came in handy several times
2114,4,"i have a ginormous head and YET, was shocked to find that i'm a 2XL in this helmet. it fits perfectly. make sure to measure your skull before purchase.<br /><br />my main priority is, of course, safety. so i'll accept that i look like a bobblehead (though less so in this helmet than in others). this helmet fits all the way around, snugly, and seems well made. the flat black is as sleek as they come, so while i still look a fool, i can trick myself into thinking a little less clownish."
2115,5,"It was easy to install and fits the 'V' perfectly. In my opinion, this should have been standard equipment on the 'V'!"
2116,5,"This cover was meant to be used indoors.  I liked that it had the elastic around the bottom, but I bought the wrong size so it was a little to small for the Harley."
2117,5,"Order process went well... Install wasn't to bad. Using it.... Wonderful. Nice wide view, doesn't vibrate much. Way better than the two CIPA side mirrors I purchased. This is on a new ranger crew."
2118,5,"Excellent product, I am very happy with the quality and look of this product. It does its job very well, the instructions are easy to follow if you need them. The parts used are not thin or cheap they feel solid and really show a true level of quality. The block off provided for the Noise Tube is aluminum and comes pre-setup to add a temp sensor, nitrous fogger or anything else you want to. Really a great kit!"
2119,5,"When I accidentally knocked my side mirror off, I thought it would cost a fortune to fix. Saw the exact mirror brand new for super cheap and put it in ourselves! Looks exactly like before and we didn't have to dip into our savings to go to the dealership.Worked out perfect!"
2120,5,"This unit works as well as, or better, than the stock unit.  Removal of the old regulator took a while due to the tight space, but installing the new unit was easier due to it's more compact, improved design."
2121,1,"after reading about the chrome mirror covers. i thought i was getting the same mirror covers that come on the chevy trucks from the factory. after all, the product does say &#34;factory-grade chrome mirror covers&#34;. GM, makes the covers so that you have to remove the black insert and snap in the chrome cover in its place. a very nice and clean look. this product is just a cover that is double faced tape to the outside of the mirror. very cheesy.  i guess i will have to go to a different site to find the product i acually want. very disappointing."
2122,5,"Exactly as advertised, but had too be assembled. It was very difficult too assemble but works perfect after being assembled."
2123,3,"the guides behind assembly are too thin and fragile , also did not align that good with headlight assembly, other than that they look fine"
2124,5,"We put this on our 1999 GMC Safari van and it worked well, went on easily.  I would recommend it."
2125,5,"Works great!  After opening the refrigerator in the past and having stuff fall out after travelling, these have been a welcome addition...No more eggs on the floor!"
2126,5,"The antenna works great, no reception problems at all. I installed it on an FJ Cruiser, now it is much easier to clean the windshield without the long original antenna getting in your face."
2127,5,"Let me tell you something.  I know a thing or two about stickers.  I have many many stickers in my collection and this one might be the best.  The quality of the adhesive and the ease of application make this a superior product.  Just peel and stick, it's so simple!"
2128,3,"These are definitely not the quality I was expecting from the famous Weathertech brand. The front visors are okay, but the install was significantly more challenging than the Weathertech video led me to believe. Still, the fit alright and are very snug (the fronts). The rear visors are a different story. Even with the adhesive strip, they do not stay in the channel. Without the window holding them in, the rears fall down. In other words, you can't roll down the window without the rears falling out - and that's sitting still. I just got these yesterday, and I called Weathertech customer support about this. I was told to leave the rears in for 48 hours to allow for a good seal of the adhesive (although the directions indicate a maximum of 12 hours). After that time period, they suggest returning them for a replacement set. I'm going to give this a try, despite my reservations; something this pricey shouldn't have immediate problems. I'm tempted to get the OEM Honda ones from an Amazon seller, but that style affixes to the exterior of the Crosstour (versus the in-channel style of these Weathertechs) and the look of the stick-on style just isn't as appealing to me; particularly with the nice chrome trim surrounding the Crosstour windows. I'll update this post with the outcome. If the 48hrs doesn't work, I'll either resort to glue/additional double-sided tape or return these and get the OEM version, since Weathertech is the only other option could find (both online and locally). Hope this review helps someone. I couldn't find many reviews at all for our vehicle."
2129,4,"This brush is not nearly as good as the detailing brush that Rubbermaid used to make.  That one had a retractable brush, and the stiffness was variable depending on how far out one dialed the bristles.  Alas, it's no longer made, and mine was stolen by mechanics at my Ford dealer!  This is as close as I could come to the one I lost.  It's not the same, sadly, but it will suffice.  I had to rate it better than 3 stars because the price was so reasonable, and because it may be the best of the detailing brushes that are currently available."
2130,5,"Hey All:<br /><br />So I was given a tester of this stuff by a promoter of the product at a car show.  Normally when I get something like this at a car show I, I normally think its probably a rebadged generic product, and it of marginal quality at best.  I have 7 coats of Zaino on my car currently, but wanted something on top of that after a wash, as it wasn't as smooth as it could be.<br /><br />Needless to say I applied a little on the rear trunk of my car just to see what this actually could do.  After a few profanities, I begin to giggle as I quickly did the rest of my car.  It was almost night and day.  I have never seen such a fantastic finisher ever, and really and truly is the only finisher you would need.  It makes the car feel like an Orca wale while at the same time being really easy to put on and then rub out.<br /><br />This is not a wax, nor is it a wax substitute, but if you do this once a month on top of your existing wax, and then do a couple coats, your car will look almost wet the whole month.<br /><br />This also works great for mitigating brake dust on wheels."
2131,5,Tough hitch. Solid piece. Heavy as all get out. Even the hitch label is well made.  Don't expect to ever buy another one in my lifetime.
2132,5,"I am happy with the quality of these brake pads. These last a very long time,ceramic is the way to go! The set that I removed had approximately 60,000 miles on them and still had about 30-40 % left before completely worn. These fit perfectly and includes new clips/slides. remember to torque caliper and slide bolts to specs which you can look up. Pads also require a little brake lubricant grease on the slides so they dont bind up and wear unevenely."
2133,5,Get one and keep your proof of insurance/registeration in it.  You won't be fumbling around looking for it any more.
2134,5,Did exactly what it was supposed to do.  Build quality was good.  Value was definitely worth it! Glad I finally got one.
2135,5,My 2012 Kia Optima SX has some wimpy road runner sounding horns.  I replaced those with these PIAA horns and couldn't be happier.  They sound so much better not to mention louder.  Great product and I highly recommend them.
2136,1,"I ordered this tail light assembly because of the description, tail light assembly. I think the product description needs to read as tail light lens only. I spent a little more on this one because I just ordered a brand new truck bed and just had it painted. I had to put the lens over my old assembly and tape it to my new paint job. I had no choice because the old lenses fell apart in my hand when i removed them. I am very upset about this because the tape has to stay on until i can receive a new &#34;assembly&#34; from another company. I will not order from this company again."
2137,5,Seems to be genuine Honda product for much less money. A few hours of laying it in the sun and it flattened out and fits perfectly. Nice quality. Very happy with this product.
2138,4,"A little difficult to put on but once my husband put some muscle in and it was on, I love it!"
2139,5,great bag I'm really please is big hold what i need great buy is worth every penny thank you to a great design
2140,3,Wasn't sure that it fit properly but kept tightening bolts until snug. Not a clean fit but seems solid.  No concern attaching rack with 100 lbs on camping trip.
2141,5,even though amazon said this wouldn't fit it's the exact pump used for my car (2001 toyota celica gts) i just un pluged the old one and replaced it with this one instant washer fluid on command awesome... just wish it were cheaper but oh well.
2142,5,"These floor mats are 100% wonderful!  Living in New England, I needed something that would really handle the dirt and snow, etc. and these fit the bill!!  Great product ... so glad I bought them!"
2143,5,"Easy to install, and great quality. The Chevrolet shop wanted to charge me 150 dollars for just one to install. Did it myself in 10 minutes."
2144,5,I found on another site a good tip since when I got the supports they seemed to long.  If you take both support off you will have additional room  and it makes it easy to put both on at once.<br /><br />Product works great and the price is way less than from a dealer.
2145,2,I ordered seat covers with floor mats and the back seat was to be black like the picture and is pink this front seats mats are not the same as the picture eather not happy about the wrong color :( #good luck
2146,3,Installation was a breeze looks really nice against the Black Vehicle.<br />Almost looks factory Installed.<br />However didn't make it through the first car wash Chrome Inserts Broke off<br />May order another set or a different Type
2147,5,These plug wires should last the rest of the life of the minivan they were installed on.. Factory plugs had 125K on them and were toast.. Because they are very hard to replace we wanted quality and that's what I got.. Only gripe is manufacturer did not include dielectric grease pack but we had some in the tool box and used it.. These were shipped free and fast and have a 3 year defect warranty.. Also were less expensive then the Asian made ones at the auto parts store..
2148,3,"I liked the nice fragrant it give off at the start. However, it died out quickly. It needs to last a little longer for the price."
2149,5,"This item zip ties to the existing C6 Corvette grill.  It takes about 45 minutes to install. I put small rubber bumpers on the bottom edge to protect the cars paint. It looks Very good, and you just cannot beat the price.  This is my second one. A raccoon destroyed the first one.  I think he survived......"
2150,5,"Original Ducati Performance part. Looks fantastic and sounds even better. Very easy install and worth the price IMO.  This works perfectly with Barnett Billet Clutch Basket,  Barnett Clutch Plate Kit, Barnett Spring Kit and Barnett Billet Clutch Pressure Plate."
2151,5,Excellent spark plug i recomend this product was tested whit yamaha two stroks and go very very well models 1991-1998
2152,5,"Shipment was expedited and it arrived as paid for.  I just installed this radiator fan assembly on my 2008 PT Cruiser, and it was easy to do.  It comes with the relays and the exact pigtail connection to hook up to the power supply.  This fan runs much quieter than the previous one I had.  The only question is how long it is going to last.  The last one from another brand lasted almost one year.  If there is any problem on tis Dorman brand, I will post another comment.  If not, then everything is good!"
2153,5,This is the perfect book for refreshing yourself or for studying for the initial Class A license exam.  Definitely recommend.
2154,5,"great fit-- quiet ride, great stopping no vibration<br />great fit-- quiet ride, great stopping no vibration.  Easy to install and better than new performance.  Will buy again from amazon."
2155,5,"Perfect. It does not need adaptation of any class, it was 'just' take the old out (and move half the trunk to do that) and put this one in, DS46B24R Yellow Top Battery for Toyota Prius has the perfect size post (Japanese). Love it. YouTube video helped with the 'move'. Can I post a link here? Let's try: [...]"
2156,4,"... gets the job done... pretty close match, but not perfect... if you have an older car, I would recommend a blended paint from a paint store or auto body shop to match the color better... the prep will determine the quality of the finish as will the clear coat... I highly recommend Max 2K 2-part single stage clear coat after applying perfect match... it's expensive, but it will determine the final finish..."
2157,4,The item was as described and worked perfectly for what I needed it for. The only issue I had was that it arrived dirty. Both pans had oily brown spots all over the front and back. I'm using them in my classroom so I had to clean them before I could use them.
2158,5,"These remain cool and do not produce the intense heat that traditional RV lights produce. I think they are safer to use. They do produce a very white light, though. It takes some getting used to; but again, the trade off is a cooler RV and I think safer!"
2159,4,Great reusable wipes that can also clean your phone and tablet screens. Really don't need paper towels anymore.  Friends are stealing them right and left.
2160,5,"Excellent price and thicker than I expected.<br />I have purchased more expensive wraps in the past, and this product met my expectations."
2161,5,"similar to other reviews, it does stink for a week or 2, but after that is fine. It feels great, fits great on my mercury, I get compliments all the time.  I love it!"
2162,5,"I love the plate cover, it is just as it appears with one exception, I had pulled up motorcycle plate covers and thought that was what I had purchased.  At first I was disappointed but put it on my car anyway and now love it.  Wish it came in size for my motorcycle!"
2163,4,"Brighter, white light at a great, beat &#34;WalMart by a mile&#34; price shipped.  Did flange mod and have 9005's in the 9006 (low beam) spots so quite a bit of nighttime road coverage on High's..."
2164,5,"For the money it works as it should, great. Took a long time to get but the customer service kept me up to date and really appreciated that."
2165,5,"we use to purchase this filter from the tool truck! Big money!!!<br />found it on Amazon, great, same unit, We will purchase it from<br />now on there, b/c we need to change it every year!"
2166,1,It is impossible to find the tie-rod ends for the rugged ridge steering setup for my ZJ. I have had the setup for just under a year and all the tie rods are shit. Ordered this one to replace the passenger side tie-rod. It was the wrong one. And Rugged Ridge doesn't exactly specify which tie-rods to use. Now I'm stuck with this CRAP because I MISSED the return cutoff. SELL this JUNK and buy a Currie one-ton steering setup. I will never buy Rugged Ridge again. Just horrible
2167,5,"I was and am very pleased with these bulbs. I bought enough for my rear license plate and my glove compartment. Of course I installed them in the daytime and forgot to go out that night and check them out. The following morning I hopped in the car swung open the glove compartment and the interior of my car was flooded with light. These are very bright bulbs, very easy to replace and align, and they make a world of difference. I'm very pleased with the bulbs.<br /><br />Edit (12/15/2013): Unfortunately my application of these bulbs for my rear license plate didn't last very long. In December, after four months they had \\""burned out\\"", and had to be replaced with the original incandescent bulbs. My rear license plate is installed on my hatchback (2013 Volvo XC60) but closing the door is not a rigorous activity. I'm somewhat disappointed in their life, I don't think they were subject to \\""wear-n-tear\\""."
2168,5,"Bought this as a replacement for my E46 m3 when I was changing the water pump.  This same belt is available from other BMW specific retailers and it is cheaper off amazon.  Factor in how quickly amazon ships their products, I found this to be the best value.  The belt is very high constructions and it's nice to know there is alternative to waiting days for items to be received from 3rd party venders for my BMW"
2169,5,Very simple to use.  Pays for itself in no time.  My neighbors and relatives love it too.  You will too.
2170,5,worked great... you can buy extra nylon screen material at the hardware store if you need to cover more area
2171,5,"It fit perfect, the only thing lacking in the package was the hardware to install it. Great deal! Thank you."
2172,5,I love it!  The installation took about 1 hour and that was because my 4 yr old wanted to help.  Instructions were clear and easy to follow.  Truck has not thrown a code yet.
2173,4,3 hour install due to rust and locked up nuts even after a week long pb blaster treatment<br /><br />1990 Nissan D21 Base extended cab  31X10.5R15  NO LIFT
2174,5,The instructions were clear and the installation was simple. Gave me a chance to know my Jeep a little more. I like the way the connector stays out of sight in the spare tire compartment; also protecting it from the weather.
2175,2,"The part said it fit a 1966 Chevelle, and it did not. Had to go to dealership to get the right one. I am glad this part was not expensive, but still wasted $10.00 on it."
2176,1,"This mirror is not for a 2004 Volvo S80 as advertised. I tried to put it on and it didn't even remotely remind of the shape of the original mirror. Went to the Volvo dealer and bought one that fit perfectly.<br /><br />I am returning the item and the seller who didn't even want to pay for sending it back.<br /><br /> In summary, don't buy it."
2177,3,"I am only giving this wash mitt a rating of 3 stars. The quality of the mitt seems fine, at first. I just used it for the 5th time and this mitt will just not stop shedding. I find fuzzies on the car, in my wash bucket and in the slop sink I use to rinse the mitt after I use it. If it ever stops shedding it may be fine."
2178,4,These sprockets are very well built and heavy duty hopefully they will last a good long time... all in all they are great
2179,5,just what I needed.fit like factory thankshard time finding it but was happy amazon found it for me .love parts
2180,4,That little bit of extra length on the seatbelt prevents the seatbelt from locking up whenever you accidentally move it to faster too far
2181,3,added to a full tank of gass and ran gas tank down to empty and didn't really notice a big change.
2182,3,"I use these for diluted vinegar to wash produce.  My problem with normal sprayers is that the vinegar is too harsh and the sprayer stops working after a few weeks.  This one had the same problem, however it took several weeks longer to break.  So it's better than a normal sprayer, but not great."
2183,5,"I'm very happy with these, install on my 2006 VTX-1300S took about 2 minutes, and they look like a million bucks. They feel very solid, and the chrome looks to be of good quality for the money. Additionally, you *can* see a bit of the turnsignal from the side (there's a thin strip of amber that goes around where the bezel meets the rest of the housing). Sharp, and compliments my bike nicely.<br /><br />Just make sure you pull the heat shields (like the instructions say), make sure the gaskets are seated, and make sure that you insert the screw-holder part of the lens into the housing first, then pop the top in. The install was ridiculously simple."
2184,5,I bought this produce for my 2005 injected Harley Road King. The only thing I can say is when you buy this product you have bought the best. A 15min installation and I was ready to run. I bought it from Amazon because it was the best price I could find from a company I trusted. Like I said plug and play it is fully automatic. Great product at a good price.
2185,5,Works like a Charm<br />Much better construction then a after market one that I bought that lasted less then 6 months (RichPorter)
2186,1,"Please be careful. Amazon did not shown Toyota Matrix at all. So I put Toyota Corolla and it should fit, but Unfortunately it doesn't fits in my Toyota Corolla Matrix ;("
2187,1,not as what advertised.  RPM was slower than what it claims. should have listen to others that rated it .
2188,5,Well made and stylish. Support our troops! They are the brave ones protecting and serving our country! I think this is a great product for any vehicle
2189,5,"I walked away from this intall and felt like I accomplished something. The hitch works great, took maybe 15 minutes to install and I did not have to remove the bumper or exhaust. Buy it"
2190,4,"Very heavy duty, fit perfectly.  The only negative is the middle section where they connect by overlapping sometime comes apart.  I think one continues piece would have worked better.  I'm assuming that is not a possibility due to the weight of the mats."
2191,2,"Ok, I just had to get it for the way it looked. I figured I’d have many uses for this tool and I was wrong!  Its about 18 inches long and the blade will need to be hand sharpened with a file. It took me about 20 minutes to get it functionally sharp. Its well balanced and well made but there is something about a round hatchet blade that makes it look mean but is dysfunctional in its intended use. I tried to chop a 2 inch branch and it just wouldn’t work. Meanwhile, my trusty hatchet dispatched the same branch in short order. It should have supplied a blade protector for the price. It’s hanging in my shop until I figure out its best use. $50 lesson learned. Not worth the price."
2192,5,"These mats are a perfect fit for the Mini. We had cloth mats before, these are &#34;All Season&#34; and they are made out of rubber (or imitation). They fit perfectly in the car. Make sure to select the proper year for your own Mini, just in case there are some differences :)"
2193,5,Bought a new weight distribution hitch that came equipped with a 2&#34; ball ... I needed a 2-5/16&#34; ball for my larger travel trailer but wanted one with the larger big beefy 1-1/4&#34; shank ... my WD hitch had a hole for that size and NO WAY would I go buy a 2-5/16&#34; ball with a smaller diameter shank and use a spacer in it!<br />I want to best thickest built ball and shank and I could not find a ball this size with this larger shank here locally.<br />Price was great and I love having a big bad boy ball and shank to pull the 5-6K load of my trailer.
2194,5,"I had been looking for a decent rear view mirror for use on my Pontoon Boat.  Most boats have a fixed framed windshield which are about 3/4&#34; in thickness.  My pontoon boat has a plastic windscreen that is primarily for decoration and would not hold a mirror.  Thus I was looking to fit a mirror on to the 1 1/4&#34; railing and uprights.  This one said it would work.  When I first opened the box and  tried to fit it on, it looked to be too small.  However, when I removed the small inner rubber strip, it slid on snuggly, and tightened up fine.  It has a great range of adjustments so I can use it very easily.  This is a rather large mirror, but when you are pulling someone on a tube, you need this size as they swing back and forth, hence the wide area view.  All in all I am glad I found this one and its considerably less expensive than one I found at the dealer as well."
2195,5,This bell looks even better than online.  The online photo does not do it justice.  I bought this for my husband and he loves it.  The detailing is great.  Seems to be good quality.  I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a bell.
2196,5,Put it on my car and it made a big diffreance shines for a long time made my car look new
2197,2,nozzle very inexpensive but the pressure is much less than on my previous melnor brand product that broke when dropped... will order one of those even though they only last a year or two.
2198,5,"This engine oil cooler kit will allow a Patriot to pull up to 2000lbs. It is a genuine factory conversion kit with all parts nec. It is Mopar part no. 82210701. This kit is for all stick Patriots, 2007- 2013. It is also the correct kit for CVT transmission cars made AFTER Nov. 2009<br /> Mine is a 2010 with \\""Auto-Stick\\"" CVT. The instructions show both types of kits. If yours is a late auto, just follow the directions for a stick.<br /> The one I ordered came from Steve White Motors. Shipping time was quick & it was packed in its' original, unopened, Mopar box. Just like I would get from my local dealer, only a little less expensive."
2199,4,THIS ITEM WAS NOT TO HARD TO INSTALL THEY HAD GOOD DIRECTIONS AND A  GOOD COST  THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT
2200,5,"The blade installed quickly, it fit perfectly and works well.  With so many Odyssey's on the road I am not sure why there are not more after market rear window blades available."
2201,5,"one of the few times it worked like a charm. I had thought that I had damaged the mirror when I accidently hit it,but it was a funky switch."
2202,5,"First of all, I'm not a mechanic, but I do my fair share of maintenance on my own car, so this review is purely from my own experiences.<br />Also, I listed the different years for the title only because those cars are what KYB's catalog says the struts (KYB 334151 and 334150) fit.<br /><br />After reading reviews with many people saying that the boot (KYB SB104) did not fit the struts (KYB 334151 and 334150) for my car (1999 Nissan Maxima GLE), I was really hesitant about making the purchase.  I even went so far as to directly e-mail KYB informing of the reviews and asking for their confirmation that the boot did indeed fit the strut. Here's how the conversation went:<br /><br />To Whom it May Concern,<br /><br />I'm looking to purchase some KYB GR-2/Excel G's off of Amazon (Manufacturer #: 334151 - Front Left Strut) and the SB104 Boot (the one that KYB suggests for the strut), but after reading reviews, many people have stated that the SB104 Boot doesn't fit on the 334151 strut.  I was wondering if you guys could clarify the anomaly for me.<br /><br />Thanks for your time and have a good day.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />(insert my name here)<br /><br />---------This was the reply from KYB tech support------------------------------------<br /><br />(insert my name here),<br /><br />The struts 334151 will work with SB104, we had never had an issue with them.<br /><br />Thank you<br />Tech Support<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Granted, their reply didn't do a whole lot to assuage my fears, but I ended making the purchase for 2 boots anyways.<br /><br />When the boots arrived, the bump-stop (thick beige rubber part) was inserted all the way into the boot (for shipping purposes, I assume), so I had to jimmy/rotate/pull it out of the black boot part - and it does indeed come out with some force.<br />Note: be careful when taking it out though, the boot is hardy, but it's still breakable if handled without some finesse.<br />From what I can recall, I'm pretty sure the instructions noted that the bottommost ring of the bump-stop was supposed to fit into the topmost ring of the boot, so that's what I ended up doing (by jimmy-ing it back on); it fit like a charm and the spacing was just right to have the boot cover the part of the strut that needed protecting.<br /><br />I tried fitting the boot onto the strut (KYB 334151) and the diameter of the bump stop was indeed slightly smaller than the diameter of the shock, but it needs to be forced on with some elbow grease.<br />My assumption here is that the bump stop's diameter is smaller than the strut's because it needs to have a snug hold on it to prevent it from moving as the strut dampens everything between the road and the car.<br /><br />In conclusion, I'm kinda bummed that these only have a 3 star rating on Amazon, but that may just be due to the KYB catalog (or amazon) saying it fits other struts when it really doesn't.<br />It gets 5 stars from me though.<br />After an alignment and new brake pads/rotors on all 4 corners, my 14 year old car rides like new now, WOOHOO.<br /><br />The End<br /><br />tl;dr - CONFIRMED IT DOES FIT: KYB 334151 and 334150 - Just read the instructions and use enough force on it without breaking it. PUSH it onto the strut."
2203,1,"seller:<br />It is very difficult to explain issues to the seller and/or seller ignores what you're saying.  It's possibly due to a language barrier.<br /><br />product:<br />The physical unit does NOT look like the item in the picture and cheap looking!.  The unit also comes with no useful documentation at all!  The one book it came with has very generic and useless information.  Be warned, purchase this product and you'll have to figure out everything on your own!  The included brackets also did not fit at all no matter which way I tried to install them (i tried every possible way! ).  I ended up purchasing some washers to at least hold them in.  The included replacement console trim was also very cheap and did not fit well.<br />The software is extremely buggy!  I also question if the software is legal since when I contacted the seller regarding issues I had with the navigation software, I was sent a link to figure out which version to download on a site that appeared to provide iGo navigation software to the community.  Last I checked, they don't provide free software so it's likely to be a hacked version from production.  This also makes me wonder if the Windows CE version on the unit is legal.<br />Besides that, I also ran into issues with the sound cutting off the front speakers after system &#34;ding&#34; events.  This didn't happen all the time but when it did, I had to restart the unit to get the sound back to the front speakers.  I also had issues afterwards where I was unable to control the volume in certain apps (Bluetooth and navigation).  I had switch to the app loader before I was able to set the sound."
2204,5,The led bulbs are for style not for function if anyone buys theses lights thinking they will be just are bright as the ones they replace they are so wrong.<br /><br />The lights look very cool and that is there function.
2205,5,I was concerned by the price it might not work. It fit perfectly.  You can't tell which one we replaced.  I highly recommend this to anyone looking for this part. Price is good as well.
2206,1,"Once we got it installed (took a solid 4 hours), it works great. however i wish the manual had more detailed pictures that were specific to the model of your car. Many of these are for a few cars that are similar. A detailed wiring diagram of the ECM harness would've helped a ton. So far though, it's worked great. The speed will float a bit when going up/down hills, it's not as advanced as cars with built in cruise controls, but it does the job. I installed this on a 2008 Suzuki Forenza with manual transmission.<br /><br />EDIT: 12/22/13<br />this works intermittently at best now. often won't set cruise, but every so often I get lucky, it'll hold the cruise for a mile or so (or less) then disengage. Very disappointing."
2207,3,they are very nice and lightweight but when i received them and opened them the clip for it to be screwed onto truck was broken so little disappointed in that but nothing super glue couldn't fix over all would recommend just find better shipping....
2208,5,"After a couple of months of having the check engine light on, I decided to get the code reader and got the P1135 error on a 2001 2.2L Camry. I received the sensor and socket today and tried to remove the old sensor. My Haynes manual said to run the engine for a couple of minutes so I did that. Also sprayed some PB Blaster on it. Put on an adapter and used my 1/2\\"" ratchet. It started to move but seemed to be getting harder to turn. Got my 18\\"" Craftsman breaker bar and turned it some more. Still seemed to be getting harder to turn.<br /><br />Took the socket off and looked at the old sensor. Looked like its coming out crooked. Went to talk to a mechanic at the service station. He said the threads are stripped and the exhaust manifold will have to be replaced. I don't live in California but the car has CA emissions which means there's a front three way catalyst right below the sensor. I later got an estimate from him. $1100. That light doesn't bother me any more!"
2209,4,"I would love these if they were stainless steel. mild carbon steel will get rusty in just a few months on my Jeep. If you live where they put road salts down in winter, these will rust."
2210,5,It is large enough not to lose in your purse!!  (really good quality and attractive as well)  Would be an inexpensive gift for any Celt you know and love!
2211,5,"these brakes are by far the best brakes ive owned in my time of driving, they stop and are more quiet that the brands i have used"
2212,4,"I don't work on cars as much as I used to, but the PPIII Ultimate does cut down jumping relays and such.<br />I think it's worth the money."
2213,5,"perfect fit, performance exceeded my expectations, I recommend to anyone looking to improve their braking performance, I will purchase again"
2214,5,"I live at the far end of the earth and rely on Amazon for lots of things you probably get from the shop down the street. The nearest auto supply place is farther than I care to go for a $5 purchase; Amazon will deliver to my doorstep a decent filter, of the kind I've been relying on for decades, for the walk-in price. I like the Bosch filters, never had one come apart or do anything odd, and they have an astonishing assortment, filters for everything imaginable. I know there are people out there who spend their time taking them apart and critiquing them; I'm not one of them. I rack up some pretty good mileage and have never had an oil-related problem; then again, practically nobody does these days, so that's not remarkable.<br /><br />Have no fear of buying a Bosch filter from Amazon."
2215,1,This is reflective surface of low quality.  Doesn't work in car because spring so flexible that the entire thing just shakes so much you can't see.
2216,1,"I received these lashes for my car and were excited at first but it's nearly impossible to curl the lashes and once I did curl them, the just flop.. Not even somewhat cute. I would never buy these again and it was a total waste of money. I guess you get what you pay for."
2217,5,All holes and shape was exact match to factory bumper no problems whatsoever would recommend this bumper over the factory replacement if cost is an issue
2218,4,I liked but when the rain is a little thick I get wet I don't know how but two times I really get wet.
2219,5,Item was described to fit my vehicle and was an exact fit.  Easy to install and works with no problem.
2220,5,Don't waste money on OEM or Philips bulbs - get these at half the price (or less) and neither you or anyone on the road will ever be able to tell the difference.
2221,5,"What can I say?  I love my Kia Soul, I love the ads, and I love my seat belt buddy.  I have one on the passenger side and my girlfriends think I'm weird, but the make sure the hamster is sitting on their shoulder ;)  Adorable."
2222,1,"Did not work for me no matter what I did. Teflon tape, silicon grease, the fittings that go to the bleeder drew air no matter what I did. After going through bottles of brake fluid trying to get it to work, I reverted back to the old school way, a piece of hose and a jar! Was done in 25 minutes! I found it is much better to push the air out rather than try and pull it out. I found the Mityvac useless!"
2223,5,"Highly recommended seller.  The tail light was as described and come quickly.  Perfect fit and function, just take off the old, swap the bulb holders, plug in the harness."
2224,3,"it was what i expected, the right part for a decent price.  amazon had the best price although i felt that it was a bit expensive for a radiator going into an econobox jalopy. been over a yr now and its still doing its job."
2225,5,"I have had one of these for years; bought another one for a friend.  When you are washing your car, you inevitably pick up particles of dirt and grit.  Rinsing your wash mitt (or whatever you use) helps, but the grit goes into the water bucket, where you can pick it up again and then rub onto your car's paint, and you don't want that happening.  When I go to empty the bucket, I can see the grit that fell to the bottom.  The grit guard keeps the grit away from your wash mitt.  The guard is a bit on the wider side.  I found that it works best with buckets that are larger (4-5 gallon) and have vertical sides, not ones that taper to a narrower bottom."
2226,3,A wishy washy product that took 4 applications to work at all.It was amediocre performer in my eyes and had to be done over with Permatex.
2227,5,exactly what I was looking for. works a lot better than a milk crate or cinder block to stand on while working under the hood of my truck. went together easily and seems to be fairly well made
2228,5,"Of several brands of micro fiber cloths that I own, these are the best lint free ones to clean my eye ware."
2229,5,"Easy installation, great sound even at high speed. People on the other side of the line won't even notice you are on the road."
2230,5,Awesome item that clearly increases night time driving!  Why pay for HID when these do the job with quality and easy installation!
2231,5,"I bought this hitch for my husband and He loves it. He put it on our 4-Runner the very same day we received it. The quality is amazing, for being plastic. I would purchase from this company again."
2232,5,Replaced both Belts on 2002 Suburban to get rid of squeaking sound when raining or cold.<br />Belts did the trick.
2233,5,"I purchased this brake rotor for the rear of my 2004 Nissan Quest. Centric has a nice web search so you can make sure you get the right parts. ([...] Alway make sure when you install new brakes and pads that you properly \\""bed\\"" the pads ([...]"
2234,5,Funny after I put this on my VW Passat people quit tailgaiting me and blowing their friggin horns!!!!!!!!!! Seems that everyone wants to know if I actually own the weapons shown. I tell them that if I had a window sticker big enough to show all the weapons it would wrap all around the car. Have several beleiving that I have an RPG on backorder from a Russian arms dealer!! People will believe anything!!!LOL
2235,5,"Package arrived on time. I love Nightmare Before Christmas, so this was a nice gift for myself. Comes with two places to latch onto something else, so you have options. Overall I love it."
2236,2,"While the merchandise was of average quality, it did not fit my vehicle like it should have...AND YES I did make sure I ordered the right product. Straps to fasten it in place ripped off while installing seat covers, the head covers did not cover the headrests fully."
2237,5,They came well packaged. They are very bright. gives our 05 trailblazer a whole new look. Highly recommend to anyone. Even my grandma. She still keeps it pimpin.
2238,5,"Went camping on a cold night , and needed this to keep our battery charged. . Easy to install (cause my husband put it in lickity split) and heater came on  and it was a good night!"
2239,5,I was skeptical because the price was so much lower then even the used ones that are out there. I finally installed it and I am pleased that it works just fine.
2240,5,Took them to the eye center for prescription glass and they fit and look great!<br /><br />Hope to keep close by
2241,5,"Bought this for my son, he is stateside now. He was stationed in Okinawa<br />for five years and he worked on and flew alot in this helo!<br />Thanks"
2242,5,This works great to protect my new Honda key!!  Slips right on and holds up great!  Love this product a lot!
2243,5,I am so impressed with this light.  I could just stare at it for 100 years and never get bored.  It is superb.
2244,5,"I just bought a 2001 Dakota, and it did not come with a manual.  I needed even the simple things - what viscosity of oil?  How much?  I ordered this manual on the way home from the dealership and it came as promised, containing what I need to know."
2245,5,"Fits my car great. Product came in perfect condition, easy to install. graphic was bright. Item is plastic ad light weight. good for looks."
2246,4,"Plugs can boxed up inside another box, but 3 of the 4 plugs had come out of it's own package, no visible damage and so far functioning great."
2247,5,"Master Lock provides a good solid product here. Great value. Anyone looking for a secure way to lock up yor receiver, can't go wrong with this."
2248,5,My son needed these for his polisher.  It is just what he wanted.  Would order again.  Just what was shown.
2249,5,"This thing can be installed by a novice. It took me 2 hours from start to finish. You dont have to remove the plastic screens from RAV4 to connect it. Remove the left and right plastic panels and just disconnect the existing connections and bridge them through CURT connectors. All in all, great product and built to last. Very good quality; something you can expect from CURT. Go Texas, go CURT :)"
2250,4,"product is OK,  but, lock very hard to work.  Tuff to get off bracket. Get ready to try 100 times."
2251,5,ITS K&N WHAT MORE CAN I SAY!!!! NAME SPEAKS FOR IT SELF. I ALWAYS HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT AND NEVER WAS DISAPPOINTED ONCE............
2252,5,"I will not be installing them for a while, but they appear to be just what I was looking for."
2253,4,"work well, modest improvement over OEM. Dust is also about the same. I was expecting more, but am satisfied with the performance."
2254,5,My Hyundai dealer in Dallas was trying to hard sell the installation of the cabin air filter for $76.  I watched a youtube video and did it myself in 5 minutes with no tools.  I saved over $60 and have a good reason why Dealership repair shops are not to be trusted.
2255,5,it was easy to install and has plenty of length to it. constructed well and should last for quite some time.
2256,5,way cheaper than going to a car dealership to replace your key fab.  wish I would have bought 2 of them!
2257,2,These fasteners were advertised to fit a Mercedes E320. They did not fit. The fasteners look to be of good quality but were incorrectly advertised for the Mercedes.
2258,5,"they are perfect, right size ,right color ,they were just what i needed,my old ones were falling apart these fixed me right up ."
2259,5,"This is better than buying it at the dealership (at a high price), which is what I used to do."
2260,5,Easy to use. Adds the extra stability to our step. Makes up feel more secure and has less wear and tear on our step joints. Recommend to all RVers.
2261,5,"If you have kids like mine, they love to pull the latch on my Avalanche and watch the tailgate drop fast and hard.  After one near-hit to the head, I ordered these the next day.  I did modify the bracket, but for any Chevy tailgate, they will bolt in less than it takes you to find your tools.  If you know anything about the tailgate of an Avalanche, they are HEAVY, and the damage they could do to a little one's skull makes me shudder.  Now, I can pull the latch and watch it drift down without the loud bang."

2263,3,"These tags work on the AT&T HTC One, but not the Verizon Samsung Galaxy S4. Too bad these dont work on the S4."
2264,5,"The Raybestos name stands for quality, reliability and while NOT cheap, a good deal! Been in the business a while and have never had a problem with their brake parts."
2265,5,The glasses work great for my motorcycle riding.  I have some for every part of the day and weather condition.
2266,5,This was very reasonable and ordreed it to see if it was my charger or Garmin. Fortunately found out Garmin is OK just needed the new cord. Thank you.
2267,1,I ordered a Philips 9006 (Low-Beam) bulb based on Amazon's statement that it would fit a 2002 Sonata. It WILL NOT! or at least not my 2002 Sonata. So the lesson I learned that I am passing on to others looking for a replacement bulb is take the old bulb out of the car and compare it with the picture for what Amazon says will fit.  The review I am giving has nothing to do with the quality of the bulb. It just does not fit this vehicle.  It takes an H7 only.
2268,5,Item exactly as described works great!! This is exactly what I needed and you can't beat the price. Very happy with this product.
2269,5,We've used this for a while now and I can detect no &#34;off&#34; flavors or deposits in our water.  We have absolutely no complaints with this product.
2270,3,Hardware is junk will not fit with with bedrail caps had to smash it in they should tell you that before you make a 300 dollar purchase all though it is a quality cover
2271,5,Works flawless. Better than the universal little modules that I have used before. Signal is strong and the refresh rate is faster
2272,5,2004 chevy malibu... excellent and cheaper than the autoparts...<br />wow you can see the difference from yellow to white light and wider I love it (:
2273,1,"Poor quality and not designed very well.<br />You would think that a vehicle using 9007 or 9004 style bulbs, most would have a lamp out light on there dash. So with that saying why would you make a product the only plug in to the stock headlight plug. So unless you modify the harness you will always have a lamp out light on."
2274,4,"got them off a box deal, so the price was right. They installed easily, and so far, are just as good as the stock ones."
2275,5,Got this item to match my Yoshimura Full Exhaust system (Carbon).  Would greatly recommend to anyone who would like to make their bike stands out and not spending a fortune.
2276,4,Put this jack on a 27' travel trailer camper. Under battery power its quite slow but once the trailer is connected to the tow vehicle it speeds up to a decent pace. Have not used but a few times so I can not comment on its long term durability or quality. Thus far seems to work just fine. Coupled with a lower price tag it meets expectaions. Does the job and did not cost too much.
2277,5,I was missing two hub caps to my Camry due to tire blowouts on the freeway and ran across these due to not wanting to spend $80 a hubcap at the dealership. These were easy to put on and look nice. I am very satisfied!
2278,4,"They are a little hard to affix to the car windows, but with a little patience and care it looks good."
2279,5,Ordered this for my 2005 Hyundai sonata because my driver side fog light was shattered by a rock. The shipping was quick and it fit perfectly.
2280,4,"Great buy.  Just as described on the internet.  Fits well on my 850 Suzuki motorcycle.  The vibration does open the clasp, but I just keep an eye on it."
2281,5,"This stuff is wonderful.  I use it wherever a wet silicone spray would cause gumming.  I spray it on all types of blades, bits, and etc.  I used to use a similar product made by CRC but I don't think that is still available.  Even if it were available, I'd still choose the 3M brand.  Consider it wherever you want less friction without the side effects of gumming."
2282,5,"Other then being slightly darker then the original (not that noticeable once on) on the driver side, it's exactly the same shape, size and fit perfectly. Installation only took about 30 minutes.  Pricing was good, and compared to auto parts stores, a much better deal, even with expedited shipping."
2283,5,"Was shopping around for wind deflectors, to crack my windows and let hot air out while I was parked. After seeing many other Scion xBs with them, I went searching on Amazon and found these. Inside its alot darker, keeping the interior cooler. They are in channel deflectors but my only concern is long the tape will stick. No instructions but its very intuitive. I love how they make my xB look too."
2284,5,used with the larger Motion Pro 08-0007 16&#34; Curved Tire Iron to complete some removal and installation of 4 wheeler tires. seem strong to me and just take small steps when removing/installing tires
2285,5,"Bought this as a gift, and WOW was it a hit! The recipient was both a rock AND candle collector, and she swooned over the agate rock candle. (She hadn't seen one before). It was a bit more expensive than the 'regular' whole-rock, rock candle. But when you light this candle you can certainly see where the money went. It truly is a lovely sight! Also came with a 12-ounce bottle of oil and two spare wicks - So it's ready display and light when you get it."
2286,5,This wiper blade works very well and doesnt streak. It shipped on time and was priced low. I would recommend this product.
2287,4,"I am quite happy with the item, no error. I will replace all lights with led's. It looks so much cooler."
2288,5,"Every thing was perfect and shipped without any creases,  I cut the vinyl and separated the letters a little so it stretches the whole lenth of my windshield instead of being centered and looks great"
2289,5,I put this in my Echo mini-tiller which is almost identical to the Mantis mini-tiller but a different different color and air filter. It starts alot faster.    After warming up it starts on one pull of the rope.  Highly recommended!
2290,5,Ordered for my husband for his birthday. He loved it. It arrived on time. The price was just right. He put it on his snow board and it is holding up just great. will purchase more decals from this seller in the future
2291,4,This was purchased to prtect my Ranger seat from getting wrecked form my dogs. This is premium material and easy to install.
2292,3,What can I say about this wonderful sticker? It’s a sticker that sticks your window when you peel the back off and stick it to your window. A fine sticker.
2293,5,I had a old battery that it pulled back up to a full charge in a day and a half Love this .
2294,5,Bought to replace a broken key for 2009 Honda Pilot and works great. Still costs $25 to cut the key at local locksmith but way less expensive than the dealer. Just remove the guts from old key and place in the new key.
2295,2,I'm pretty sure the conversion kit worked...I just made a mistake of ordering 8000k when I needed 6000k....but everything was there and ready to go...allthough it wasnt plug and play..it was still good
2296,3,"this falls into the category of GED. good enough, dude. a quick release system would be nice, but will work okay as long as you don't freak out if a there's a fire."
2297,5,To protect the slightly warn drivers seat of my high mileage Subaru Outback I needed a seat cover that looks good and the Fairfield Low Back Tan Seatcover is just what I was hoping for.  I am handy and found it easy to install. It fits snug as it should but be careful pulling it over the seat back. I used a long plastic strap to carefully snake the two lower hook/ties under and back to the rings of the flap that secures the lower part of the seatcover. I will use both seat covers for the driver's side which get most of the use.  When it wears out I have a backup.
2298,3,These are quite nice but not easy to put on.  Was disappointed that the tan colored ones has black stretch fabric on the back.  The hooks are really tiny.
2299,5,We had to use one when one of our employees got stuck in the mud out 4-wheeling. We were able to jack the truck up and put rocks under the wheel.  This was purchased to stay with the truck.
2300,5,So I have been using this on my granite counter tops for some time now and love it!  It is a one step cleaner and polish. Fabulous!  But recently I decided on a cleaning binge to try it on my Electric glass top stove.  It says it's good for any solid surface. Well it worked wonderfully.  But better than that is the next time you wipe your stove top it wipes clean and doesn't streak!!  I was having trouble finding this in the market place so decided it was good enough to order online!  Try it on your glass stove top.  You won't be sorry!
2301,3,"Traveled for month across SW in Summer.  Did not work well in car, but worked great inside using AC adapter."
2302,5,"This trailer toolbox was exactly what I needed to fit my needs.  If your looking for something to keep inexpensive things out of the weather and close by for when you need them, this is the box.  If you need something that your keeping very valuable items that you need the comfort of knowing they want get stolen you might want to go with a more durable aluminum box.  This box works great for little inexspensive items though."
2303,2,"High performance 9145 light bulbs are hard to come by. I've owned a pair of the PIAA XTreme White Plus and liked them, but they only lasted 7-8 months. At $80 a pair, think they should last longer. So, when I saw PERDE offered a replacement warranty I was on board with buying. They arrived quickly, were inexpensive, and came in very nice packaging. My complaint is the PERDE 9145 bulbs just are not very bright. My OEM Sylvania bulbs were brighter than these. First time I flipped the switch, I had to get out of the truck and make sure these lights even came on. They also do not provide the white coloring (when looking at the vehicle) that the PIAA's did. &#34;Okay, so these were not what I wanted, I'll just send them back&#34; I said. I read my receipt which informed me light bulbs were filled with hazardous material and therefore could not be shipped back. Funny, they were able to ship them to me?? I would not purchase these bulbs again."
2304,5,"we were looking that model and they send it what we ordered, so it is the right one and is working fine"
2305,5,Honda card to Pimp your Ride lol a great official product from Honda for your CD's collection excellent product well made !!!
2306,5,"Great price for these spark plugs, very fast service, very easy to install, worked great and I will order another set for my FZR-1000  Thanks again."
2307,5,I picked this item from Amazon's available items. It had the same specs and bore a close familial resemblance to the unit it was to replace. What can you say about a commodity? It works perfectly. I would buy from this source again.
2308,1,"I purchased 2 of these to replace ones that had broken over time. BOTH of the items refused to hold programming. They would program, and lose programming within a few seconds. I swapped batteries in case they were bad, and still no luck. I swapped cases to my old electronics, and works like a charm... The electronics in these units are defective from day one! I would have been ok if only 1 had been bad, but BOTH were toast. DEFINITELY not impressed!"
2309,5,This was what I was looking for. Converted my front run & turn signals to driving lights too. Good product.
2310,4,Original front right strut gave out after 8 years.<br />Shopped around and to replace just the strut itself with the same mazda strut would cost $400 + labor to deconstruct & reconstruct the assembly with spring and top mount. And that's just for the right side.<br />Saw these for $80 each for an entire strut assembly and decided to give them a try.  Replaced both sides and the only complaint is the noise called strut chuckle when driving over bumps on the road.  Other than this which can be masked with the radio I'm pretty satisfied.  Now I'm just curious how durable these are vs stock.
2311,5,This is the matching set for my Toyota Prius 2010 rear mats from WeatherTec Very impressive molded fit. You won't be disappointed. WeatherTec makes a great product.
2312,5,"Works well, easy install, only complaint I have is it's hard to reach behind to peel off the backing for sticky stuff once the unit is popped in to place,I had to use a tiny pick to grab the edge and peel it off, unless I read the instructions wrong? But over all a great product. We have lots of gates stolen round the Phoenix metro area, so it's wise to have the tail gate locked. It only take 30 seconds to take one of a Dodge Ram."
2313,5,i love it it fit great. it looks great and sounds great i would recommended to any body looking for a test pipe.
2314,4,"I was tired of having my greenhouse liquids in squirt bottles that kept failing, so I tried these.  I bought multiples because of the high shipping charges for just one or two.  So far, so good -- after several months of use, the two of them I'm using so far have worked just fine."
2315,4,"I just installed these on my car yesterday and went for a quick test drive.  So far so good, no more clicking on turns.<br /><br />I had one little problem with mine. the part that mates with the transmission shaft would not slide all the way on because there were manufacturing burrs still on the inside of the splined adapter where they drill the hole for the pin .  Nothing major but If I didn't have a small enough file in my tool box I would have had to stop the job and start over another time.<br /><br />For the price you can't beat these so thats why I still gave it four stars.  If I had paid 200$ each it would have gotten 1 star but since I only paid 120$ for the pair, you get what you pay for.<br /><br />5000km on them so far and they seem to be holding up"
2316,4,"I had to do considerable re-wiring because the the Ford Edge in 2009 does not have the Access hole mentioned in the Curt diagram.  I also had to go to the right side of the vehicle for placement of the regulator because it would not fit on the left side.  This meant I had to splice extra wire into the circuit to make everything fit.  Once I got it wired up--it worked just fine.<br /><br />Thanks,  Ron"
2317,4,"It's a K&N, and for street use, I have never had a problem with any of their filters in my vehicles. I like not having to buy anymore paper filters again. Not sure how much effect it actually has on gas mileage or throttle response, but it certainly couldn't hurt or make it worse."
2318,5,not too loud-<br />not too quiet-<br />visually and audibly perfect.<br />Better than OE and not<br />at all as cheap and loud as the teenagers use.
2319,5,I tried everything I could find at the auto parts store to no avail.  But this stuff worked first time I used it.  My 2003 bumpers were so bleached out from the Florida sun and had water spots and runs they were nasty looking.  Now I look at my vehicle and I no longer feel embarrassed to drive it.  Great stuff and a great purchasing experience.
2320,5,"Great price on a great product. Can't beat this Lucas oil for my dragster, keeps the motor running smooth, and fast!"
2321,5,"Love their filters, I save tons of money with these products and love their performance. Just fit as OEM and you get even more miles to the gallon using them, so why not use them? It's even ecological since you throw less garbage on every oil change (normally change air filter and oil filter at the same time) and now you get to keep the air filter. Money in your pocket every time you change just one filter."
2322,5,"haven't tried it in the rain yet,but was fairly simple to install. easier to install if temp is warm. could not totally zip up windows but that is to be expected with new top. After it has time to stretch out and relax go back and reinstall windows, If you force them they will tear. This is better than having a top that fits loosely and flops going down the road. Quality product from Bestop. Has a question about door fitment with my sliding upper doors. Questioned the manuf. web site and got a quick response. good customer service."
2323,4,"Like the other reviews mention after a while the knob falls off, I was kinda ready for it so when it did I just got some crazy glue and stuck it down (it doesn't spin any more but it works for my purpose) and the other adjustment point is a little flimsy and needs some glue as well (I recommend just a dot of gorilla glue) but with a little touch its a very nice and classy looking up grade, not as bad as people make it out to be.<br /><br />“It is all right to make mistakes; nothing is perfect because with perfection, we would not exist.”<br /><br />― Stephen Hawking"
2324,5,"I have had the light kit for one full year.  They were EZ to install and have'nt had any trouble with them to date.  The supplier have been great also, ship out with three days.  Have ordered additional lights as add on's with no problems at all.  Started out with a 10PC set now I'm up to a 14PC set."
2325,4,I replaced my old wipers. They worked great and keep my vision clear when i was driving under rainny day. I will by another one for my rear glass when it needs to be replaced.
2326,5,"Fits my 03 4Runner perfect, I put these in all my cars. As far as the review about getting better gas mileage in 3 miles thats impossible but I think over all this will pay for itself for being clean able and never needing to buy another filter for your car."
2327,4,"Love the sturdiness and the foldability.  The texture on the top gets grimy, unfortunately, but perhaps it helps people not slip."
2328,5,Works good and gets the job done works with Ford's obd2 also I would recommend it to and one using torque
2329,5,"Fits all my CD's and movies for my kids. I love it. Whenever I am driving, I just reach up, grab a DVD, plug it in for the kids and there we go! It is perfect. I love it."
2330,4,I got this for summer and I am glad that I did. I have ordered 2 so my son can have one also.
2331,4,"Very well made. The only issue I have is that the valve end of the tool is not easy to push on the tire valve, could be better."
2332,5,"I have a Rav4 and they are known for the musty, old wet towel smell. I couldn't get rid of it! After getting this filter, it's completely gone! Best car buy. Super satisfied!"
2333,4,ordered as a second product. kit works great as long as you buy the additional core pusher. its not included in this kit.
2334,5,They fit perfectly and are new. I can see once again. Easy installation. Saved big money (Autozone wanted $230 per assembly.). I paid $63 +/- for the pair. Highly recommend this company for value and delivery.
2335,5,"Removing the old once is tricky, but be careful with the inner self locking grooves while installing the new ones. Easy install and if you make sure it aligns properly you are done with the job."
2336,5,"Part got to me on time, perfect fit, On one side it has a peel off film that uncover an adhesive to stick to the motor for easy installation, very convenient! Would recommend."
2337,5,"Very good price, perfect item. This word requirement in the comments is bs as far as I am concerned...Don't ask me to write this stuff again!"
2338,5,Really good lights. Wires was kinda short but since I didnt use grill lights was able to use those wires to extend out rest. Would be nice if we could buy extra wires if we need. But they work good and look goid in my car. Will be buying my for my husband's car.
2339,5,"These are really good handles, keep in mind you get two in the order. Guess I missed that detail, so I ordered two! These are durable overall good purchase for the money. Recommend to anyone."
2340,1,I bought these for my 05 Suabru legacy GT Limited and they dont fit! They are almost 1 full inch smaller in diameter so the brake pads can not grab the rotor fully. The rotors sent to me are only 11 1/2 inches in diameter when the stock rotors were 12 1/2 inches. So even the info page is wrong about what these really are
2341,5,"I believe in using only the best spark plugs in all my vehicles.  I consider the indium spark plugs the best money can buy. I've been using these type of plugs for many years.  I don't think I've ever had one go bad and not fire.  I know when I put these in that they will last at least 100,000 miles."
2342,5,Easy to assemble and install. Done in under an 1hr. Next time I need parts I will be back. Thank you!
2343,1,"I ordered two of these for the front of my 1982 Corvette. The first one I tried to install would not bolt up. The cross bar on the bottom was not correct. The bolt holes were nowhere near wide enough apart to use. I opened the second one with same part number and same manufacture date and it fit just fine. Monroe is sending me another shock after checking their inventory for more bad ones. I would return it to Amazon, but don't want someone else getting this and trying to install it. Guess I got what I deserved for buying cheap shocks."
2344,5,Lake Country makes the best foam pads on the market! I have never had a problem with any of their products.
2345,5,Purchased this belt for my 2006 Mustang and was a perfect fit and stopped alot of under the hood noises
2346,5,"great product, would have been nice to come with a wiring diagram, but google helped me out with that. will buy more!"
2347,5,"I'd previously purchased a Slime COMP02 from Wallyworld for around $15. It was slow, loud, and I thought it was going to rattle apart. I figured if I was going to have a portable compressor, I wanted something I could rely on. I went in search for something better and was drawn to the positive review of the 85P. For $45-50, this is a great value. Out of the box, I noticed how much better built this compressor was. Hearing the tight buzz when turning it on confirmed that. I like the screw-on connector, and the built-in light is a nice feature. To be expected, the metal pump does get hot. Because of the amp draw, be sure the car is running while the compressor is on. Overall excellent product and I plan on purchasing a second for our other vehicle and one to give as a gift."
2348,4,Very happy with purchase! Came with all parts needed and easy to follow directions. Took me 3 hours to install (I am quite handy and mechanical). Everything works great. Turn signals are manual and lights could be bigger. A lot of bang for the buck tho.
2349,5,"After reading mixed reviews, I was a little skeptical about buying these instead of OEM replacements.  Gievn ANCO's reputation I decided to give them a shot; am I glad I did.<br /><br />I drive a 4x4 pickup, so the windshield is much less curved than on most cars. I was afraid there would be a section (middle) that would not be swept well from other reviews.  WRONG.  As long as the springs on your wiper arms are not stretched you will not have any problems.  Since I installed them just over a week  ago we have had light rain, heavy downpours, heavy / wet snowfall, and a couple of light snowfalls (a.k.a. early spring in New England).  These wipe better than any blades - replacement or OEM - I have ever had; even on my Mercedes'.  Ice also does not build up on them as heavily as on my OEM blades; a shot with the washers and a few seconds with the wipers on high and they are free of snow and ice.  I will now be buying these exclusively for all of my vehicles as long as they are available.<br /><br />Many people raise / leave their wiper arms up when snowfall is expected; realize this position stretches the springs and permanently weakens them as a result.  If you do this, in time you can expect that the wipers will not properly wipe the windshield.  It's not the blades that are the problem.<br /><br />UPDATE - 2/25/14 - it's been the \\""winter from h***\\"" - a snowstorm a week, give or take -  and I'm still loving these wipers.  Do not hesitate to buy them!!"
2350,5,My grandson is very happy with the Window Vent Shade's. They were easy to install and look fantastic. Thank you
2351,5,"There was a little job in running the wires  but not overall  too bad.<br /><br />The gauge works perfedt, It matches my gauges on the cowl strip."
2352,5,"Product looks nice, fits good, and seems durable.  I put these in an 01 honda civic.  The receipt is from an actual Honda Dealership as well so they are not a knock off."
2353,5,"This charger works great at keeping batteries  fully charged in  instances where they are not used for long periods of time, like a garden tractoer or motorcycle."
2354,1,"I bought this item several years ago and it's been more trouble than it's worth. Eats batteries like no other and then I eventually ran into the 'L' issue where replacing the LR44 batteries no longer worked. Go read 'Mr. Natural \\""Randy\\""' review on the hidden CR2032 battery. Junk."
2355,4,"It was fairly easy to install even for a novice like me. The only thing I would suggest for this unit is to have the flexibility/option of using an existing switches (original switches from the vehicle make i.e. Ford, Chevy etc). I installed mine using a direct power from the battery via a fuse box and added a kill switch to turn the power off (otherwise, the lighted switch would stay on all the time)."
2356,5,Exactly what I need for my car colour is a rich nice red as described...I have no complaints at all
2357,5,Works better than OEM units I have in other cars easy hook up review needs seven more words to be correct length so there you go
2358,5,"Service was fast, item was received as described with specific instrutions on how to program it. Programming was easy and worked! Great price for a new key fab, thank you!"
2359,3,Like most premium car care products that cost alot more this just does&#34;nt do that much better of a job than any of other less expensive brands.Save some money and just use another less expensive brand name and get the same results.
2360,4,this is a great filter value for all engines that have oil and air filter service maintenance performed at least every 4000 miles.
2361,5,I purchased these as a gift and the recipient absolutely loves them!  The fit is perfect and stays in place nicely!  The color is true to the picture posted.  It's a nice product.
2362,5,This is very sturdy and very handy. It looks like it will take a lot of use vs. other styles out there.
2363,5,I bought this kit not knowing too much about how I was going to install it.  It first it looked like it was going to dripping water as did not look tight. so I decided to pour water in the bump to test first before screwing it in.  No leaks!!  It was really easy to install.  Great buy!!
2364,4,i love mickey so its hard to disappoint me....they are  a little flimsy and thin...trying to flip up on driver mat...but worked it out...
2365,4,"This received a good rating from other Amazon buyers and I was not disappointed. Be sure though to check out the requirements for the passenger side, which are different in size for Honda Accords. This blade was for the passenger side of the windshield."
2366,5,i thought this item was a little pricey but after using the beadbuster i think it was well worth the money.it worked great on a trailer and and lawn mower tire.
2367,5,"If you're doing a boat over, this is the best compound.  It really brings it back and gets rid of all the oxidation."
2368,5,It saved me about $100 dollars over the local auto shops. Installs easily and fixed my problems. Definitely worth the money.
2369,5,"Very solid construction and ridiculously easy install.  It's fairly expensive, but looks much better than the faded plastic hood catch I had before."
2370,4,I bought this one month ago and from then the car perfomance improved. affordable product and they come packaged nicely. and they're easy to install.it took me about an hour to finish installing them in my 2004 ford expedition.
2371,3,"Have 4 cars I was hoping this would work on.<br />Worked well on 2006 VW Golf, and 2005 Ford BAII Fairmont (Aussie).<br />Didn't work on 2005 E53 Mini Cooper S, or 2003 E39 BMW 525D<br />Price is good though, and seems well built."
2372,5,"Excellent heavy leather.  You can smell the quality.  This is a well built product.  The concealed carry pockets with strap are a plus, but may not fit all handguns."
2373,3,"First of all, let me say that I found this to be the cheapest price for a bed cover that I could find, and since I just wanted something to hide the train horn I'm mounting in the bed of my Ram, this will do just fine. The price is great, but keep in mind, with this and everything, you get what you pay for.<br /><br />INSTALLATION: Before you install, I suggest you unroll the vinyl cover and lay it in the sun so it will heat up and make it easier to stretch. I didn't do this, and I paid dearly for it. I actually installed it in my unheated garage on a cool day. Other than that, installation is easy and takes about a half hour or so. The gasket material they provide to you is a bit bulky but it does do the trick.<br /><br />The 2 areas of great concerns, and the reason I subtracted 2 stars, are as follows: I notice while I'm driving over 70, the rear end of the cover pushes in behind the back support beam and causes minor flapping. I installed it as per the directions(14\\"" and 16\\"" inches from the front and rear of the bed), so I have to assume it's the quality of the vinyl that causes this. It's been going on for about 3 weeks now(since I installed it) and am fairly certain it's going to be the reason I replace it. The other concern is that the c-clamps used for installation are asinine. The hex bolts to tighten them are actually turned from the top, so it's impossible to do it while the cover is on. It'd make a lot more sense, and be a whole lot easier, if you can tighten them from the bottom. I would suggest using different c-clamps.<br /><br />All in all, if you want a cheap bed cover, that you can install yourself and install quickly, this is the way to go. If you're looking for seriously high quality, you're going to spend a lot more money."
2374,5,"THanks It was wasy as pie to program , and saves me alot time getting in and out of my car"
2375,5,Nothing to complain about here. My front emblem was weathered and I simply removed it and slapped this one on. No problem- looks new.
2376,5,I gave this to a good friend and neighbor who like to wash his car and wanted to give a good  product.
2377,3,"These worked, barely . I had to add a diode to my bike's brake light circuit to both keep the tail light portion of these bulbs going and keep the backfeed they produced into the brake light system from kicking the bike's brake light relay on . Also, the high side of the lighting wasn't nearly as bright for the brake lights as the incandescents they replaced ."
2378,5,"Owner of 04' GMC Canyon Crew Cab, Z71 SLE.  Two screws, remove and replace.  JFYI, I recommend to get the harness connector ACDelco PT1231 Female 4-Way Wire Connector with Leads.  If you the inspect harness carefully, you will see the that overtime, the harness product may cause the Resistor Assembly to fail or vise versa."
2379,4,"the manual appears to be a faithful reproduction of the original Owners Manual, It is great to be able to get an accurate owner's manual for a 20 year old vehicle.  Very satisfied."
2380,5,"After a visit to the dealer, and getting a quote for $800.... I decided to search around for other solutions. This was an option, and for the price, it was feasible. It took 25 minutes to install... Adios oil leak!<br /><br />The seller was also very open, and communicative, making the sale that much better"
2381,5,This product fits great in my daughter's 2011 GMC Terrain.  It is just like the picture shows.  It is great for spills or messy hauls.
2382,5,Great price and it installed in place of the OE bearing without issue.  It's been smooth and quit since installation - trouble free.
2383,3,"Rather poorly made, but if used carefully, it will work.  I used it to start a contactor for a 3 phase pump.  Wish I had bought some thing more robust.  Not bad for the price."
2384,4,"My ignition wore out on my trusty old '97 LE.  The car has 320k miles on it so it's probably about time for a new one.  This one went in without issue.  The only reason I knock it a star is that it is very notchy.  It's almost like the tolerances between the lock and the keys is really tight.  I could see this being the case since it's brand new and I've been running one that 16 years old.  I'm hoping that it smooths out after using it for a while.  As it stands, there's been a day or so where I couldn't just pull the key out after turning off the car, I had to make sure the key was perfectly aligned to the lock and then pull it out.  If the key was slightly angled, it jammed.  I do feel like it's getting better though.  We'll see how it goes."
2385,5,Own a Honda CRV and after I cut out the part for the console it fit perfectly.  Great to have in the back seat with children.
2386,4,"This little step stool is handy, versitile and sturdy.  My kids love it.  We bought it for our motor home, but I may have to get another one, as it hasn't made it out of the house yet!"
2387,4,"I received this product and installed it the same day. Now when the car is off or when I am driving and the light isn't activated to its fullest it continues to stay dim. Very bright when fully lit but they never fade completely off, even after a day they are still lit dimly before leaving. Its not a bad thing and people think it cool when they see them. I like them overall and they do look nice and bright so I would recommend them."
2388,5,"I bought this to replace the one I had. I thought I would replace the whole stem,rather than trying to find the right washer. I found this one on Amazon, at half the price of ACE. So I got it. It was the original stem.  SW"
2389,2,"I had a small chip (pencil rubber size) and a 1 inch small crack like chipping (marker line size), I put the solution as mentioned but didn't seem to fix it."
2390,5,"The Monster beanie arrived on time. Very nice colors black & green with the Monster symbol  as pattern. The fabric is lightweight and very comfortable. If you like beanies, this one is a keeper. Thanks again."
2391,3,"I bought it for the catalytic converter low efficiency. It did not work out - I was putting a little hope on this. At the end, I have to replace the catalyic converter which is very expensive.<br />It did clean the fuel system, the car ran quieter and smoother afterwards."
2392,5,"works great and no trouble installing, OEM parts.will buy again in the future.would recommend to anyone needing to replace timing belt, this has it all"
2393,5,"I bought this product for my 1999 Dodge Durango. It got here quickly, and worked just as I expected it to. I would definately recommend this product."
2394,5,thankfully i have not had to use it yet but glad to have it with me. its a nice small kit and and well put together.
2395,1,Weapon r did not keep these on the market long for a reason they did a poor job advertising this product and it shows why . Would of been great with so fine tuning but  very dissatisfying
2396,5,its great i love it  put it on my longboard and it stuck prety well it was a good buy
2397,4,"Based on all the other reviews (falling off), I didn't attempt to install them on the outside mirrors.  I put them on the inside door post.  The ability to adjust them makes this application work well."
2398,5,"It came in fast. I was very excited to get started with it, and it was very easy and fun to use on all the cars i tried it on"
2399,5,I bought a pair of these and only had to use one. I put the other one back for future use.
2400,4,"What I liked about these are they are made to fit many different cars because of the way there manufactured, they have an accordion effect that contours to the cars, Glad I ordered them and ps these were for my 5 door 2013 Subura Impreza, saved me a lot of money over the factory splash guards, they look exactly like the picture when there on the car, the accordion effect just hides. The engineer had a great idea in designing these."
2401,5,"great price great product, would recommend this product to anyone, quick  service and heaps cheaper than any retailers in my area"
2402,5,"great product, would buy again  A A A  A  a  aaaaaaaa  aaa aaaa aaa aaaa aaaa aaaa aaa aaa /"
2403,3,Not the greatest thing in the world but it does what I want it to (which is to see who is coming up behind me when I'm at work).
2404,5,I am a ladybug lover!!!:) I decided to do my car with ladybugs and I found and ordered this charm!:) when it came in I was VERY happy with it!:) it is adorable and fits perfect with the ladybug theme I'm doing!!:)
2405,5,i have a 2000 4.7L v8 tundra i replaced the paper filter with this k&n and i never thought you would be able to tell the difference but yes better mpg and you can actually hear your engine sucking more air if you listen great product 100% recommend this to anyone!
2406,5,Nice addition to my base Wrangler.  I highly recommend these for a nice protection to your entryway of any Jeep.
2407,5,"To protect iPod or iPhone from drops and to find iPod when it slips thru couch cushions, this Lanyard is worth the money.  It is such nice quality and looks great.  I trust it to hold my iPod.  I can now trust my child with my iPod.  I have had a couple cheaper lanyards that broke and could have been disastrous to my iPod.  We spend so much on our iPod cases, so spending on a good lanyard to avoid the drops is worth it.  No more drown iPods or iPhones in the toilet!!"
2408,5,This is a quality product that works very well and for the price that includes a case it's excellent. Recommended...
2409,3,You have to buy bolts to install this and you have to be careful when tightening down as it is not a perfaect match for the original and will break easily.
2410,5,I bought these for my husband for Christmas and he loves them.  They are definitely protecting the floor of his truck from all the snow and mud.  He just rinses them off and he&#34;s good to go.
2411,5,"I haven't been able to use it in the car yet because the weather hasn't been nice enough outside, but for the little bit of use that I did on the carpet inside the house it worked great.  It has great suction power.  It's also small enough to not be a hassle to have to lug around in the car.  I can put it inside my 'carry all' in the trunk of my car and not have to take up to much room and it's light enough to carry.  I can't wait to use it in the car this Spring."
2412,5,"I have a 2004 HD Electra Glide Ultra-Classic (FLHTCUI) that had the stock 'air-ride' rear shocks which required constant attention when riding two-up with luggage.  The stock air-ride from Harley is fine when riding one up but when you really load up I found it to lose air constantly on trips and grew tired of dragging out the hand pump to maintain proper PSI to avoid bottoming out on rough roads or railroad crossings.<br /><br />I emailed a guy over at Progressive and asked a few questions and settled on the 444-4020 13\\"" shocks.  These shocks are adjustable by hand cranking the top of the shock.  I'd be nice if they'd etch a marking on the collar of the shock to help you keep track of full turns but one can do that easily with a spot of paint.  Keep in mind when adjusting these shocks on a bagger, you'll need to remove the bags to change the stiffness of the shocks. The first thing I did after installing these shocks was leave them at full rigidity and left my side bags at home.  As anticipated, the ride was too stiff so I'd get a feel of it going over bumps and pits, pull over and give them one full turn and try it again.  Then I picked up the lady and we gave it a nice test hitting driveway aprons at a good clip and NO BOTTOMING OUT.  Nice.  I think it takes a little time to find the sweet spot, but it sure is worth it so far.  Honestly I think I'm still riding them a little on the stiff side but the bike handles so much better and will only improve when I locate that perfect spot for riding one-up.<br /><br />Also these are a breeze to install.  If you swap out the air-ride shocks, don't forget to keep your old shocks upright so you can sell or store them, otherwise they'll leak and become useless.  There are other manufacturers of shocks out there but when it comes to price versus performance, I decided on these and I can't see being any more pleased.<br /><br />Like Frank said over at Progressive; it may be a little extra work moving your bags to adjust these shocks, but isn't a great ride worth a little effort?  Yes it is Frank. SOLD.shocks, but isn't a great ride worth a little effort?  Yes it is Frank. SOLD."
2413,4,"I installed this spoiler on my 2010 3.8 GT, which did not come with a spoiler originally. Let me start by saying that, overall, I really like this spoiler. This spoiler is installed using 3M tape and 2 screws. Like any other spoiler install, you use the included alignment strips to transfer the location of the mounting holes on the spoiler to the trunk lid and then drill two holes in the top of the lid where you will mount the spoiler. However, potential buyers should be advised that the location of these holes do NOT correspond to any of the holes that already exist on the under-side of the trunk lid. This means that in order to secure this spoiler (probably not advisable to rely solely on the 3M tape) you will need to drill holes on the bottom side of the trunk lid big enough to get the screw and washer through. This wouldn't be so bad either, except the holes will also not be covered up by the felt interior panel due to their locations. That being said, I bought this spoiler pre-painted from a different seller and I think it looks great, and was well worth the extra effort."
2414,5,works great i have had it on my truck now for a couple months none of the leds have gone out and is very bright.
2415,5,Love the slush mats! Looks amazing in my Grand cherokee and its really helpful when you have little kids like me or live in a rainy place.
2416,4,"Product is identical to photo, very easy to install however I don't imagine it will last long and will peal off but for the price it's definitely worth it."
2417,5,"This is a basic brake controller with no fancy features. It works on a mechanical principle rather than electronic sensors, and is based on a design made since these things were invented. This means it works reliably and predictably, all the time. No surprises, and no glitches. It's trustworthy.<br /><br />Which is what you want when you're trying to slow 7000 lbs of metal stuck to your back bumper."
2418,5,"I had thought this was a solid white sticker (like, not see-through), and intended to put it on a notebook with a label I wanted to cover up. When I got the sticker, I saw that it is see-through, so I put it on my car window instead. Either way, it is super cute and I love it."
2419,5,"product good as expected, shipped timely, I would recommend it, now my byke have a great look and drive great"
2420,5,"Bought Rhino Ramps 11909 from Autozone for about the same price as Amazon. I'm using them on a slick concrete floor with a Lexus ES350 (front wheel drive). The Rhinos are a big improvement over my old metal ones. They are wider (almost 11.5\\""), they don't slip, and they don't slide. They seem very sturdy - I left the car on them overnight and this morning everything looks fine.<br /><br />I was going to make some wooden ramps but they would have been much heavier and about three times the price so I bought the Rhinos and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />I would recommend these ramps and I would buy them again. Very happy with them.<br /><br />Some other reviewers have mentioned using rubber mats under them with rear wheel-drive cars on slick concrete and I will probably do that with my other car (rear wheel drive)."
2421,4,"These switches work well, and are pretty durable feeling. They are nothing special, but I would recommend for a basic switch with an LED indicator."
2422,1,i feel bad<br /><br />i dont like the item<br />the angle eyes melt i dont know why<br />please conact me !!<br />i want to replace the item
2423,5,"I own a classic Lincoln Mark VII and needed this switch to replace the original headlight switch, which developed an overheating issue and began to fail. This switch is for some reason listed as a Volvo switch, but it's not. I even Googled Volvo interiors to confirm this, even though I already knew this was for a Lincoln and not a Volvo (this item is so OEM it actually has the Ford logo and original product number cast right into the metal of the heatsink.)The important point with this switch is it was the only one with the heat sink. The reason the original switches failed is they overheated, yet every single replacement switch available new-in-box today is made without a heat sink except for this one. Standard Motor Products even makes the switch without the heat sink now, and that version is the only one available in stock anymore. I was very lucky to find THIS item, because it was the last one. While I can find many replacement Lincoln Mark VII headlight switches online from a variety of manufacturers, this is the only one that has the necessary heatsink, and this one was the last one. Interestingly, the merchant here is Auto Barn, and their warehouse is driving distance from my home. I went there in person and for some reason they were not able to procure this item for me, saying the only way I could order it was via the Amazon storefront. While I don't understand why this was so, I am happy to report the item shipped fast and arrived a day or two earlier than expected. I have been driving around with this switch in my car for over a month now and have observed no problems at all. I am very fortunate to have found this when I did, and very happy with my purchase and the overall experience."
2424,5,"Completely satisfied with the look and fit of this plate. Easy to follow install, plate bends with ease. Wish there was an option to have four visible lock bolts color matching black, but nothing a little duplicolor black cant fix. Worth every penny, would absolutely buy from seller again!"
2425,5,"Wasn't sure what to expect.  Material is like fire hose.  Thick, but plyable.  Kind of a PIA to install, however once I got the hang of it they went on easily.  Should last a long time."
2426,5,"I initially purchased this product to replace my AFE stage 2 intake since, in the crappy state of California, we now have to smog diesel trucks and the AFE unit is not CARB compliant. Much to my joy, the Banks unit added much better throttle response than the AFE unit, and is a much nicer unit in its construction. Installation took less than an hour and gave me no trouble at all. Now I no longer need to remove it and reinstall the factory just to &#34;smog&#34; the truck. Not to mention Amazon had the absolute best price over anyone, as well as free shipping and a coupon for 10% off of my purchase!!"
2427,5,"Bought this because recently moved to Oregon. Have learned it is not uncommon to enter what one might think is a puddle, but can actually be a flooded area that can washes one into danger. And, my husband drives all over the western part of the state for work. It is a reassurance that should he get into trouble, he could react quickly to free himself. The safety belt cutter is nicely placed out of the way and would prohit accidental injury. The hammer, my brother (a mechanic) explained is properly designed. He informed me, to use, DO NOT USE ON FRONT WINDOW. Front windows are 2 layers of glass with plastic between and are difficult to break through. The side and back windows will break with a simple tap of any pointed object. It doesn't take much. My husband said he hasn't used the tire gauge yet, as he is formilar with his old traditional one & didn't want to take the time to figure out this one yet."
2428,5,"My old one went out so I bought this one.  Shipping was quick and using You Tube, I was able to change mine out myself.  All water and oil lines lined up and works great!  I have not had any issues with this.  I used this car (until 2 weeks ago when I traded it in for a new car) on a daily bases from anywhere 5-30 miles a day for months with no overheating or any other issues, even in the Texas summer heat."
2429,5,"This is a must for anyone working on a car.  Many of the bolts in a car require low-end torque for proper tightening.  A regular torque wrench, which goes down to 120 in-lbs, is not a good fit for these bolts.  The error is usually considerably high toward the low and high torque limits on a wrench.<br /><br />This is a very well made torque wrench from Titan.  I used on several projects on my Honda and found it to be quite accurate.  With proper care, this instrument should provide many years of satisfactory service."
2430,4,I didn't like the original long antenna that came with the car and wanted to change it to a smaller one. This one works really well and no reception is lost. Great product.
2431,5,This is an awesome set for a low cost. Helmet is well made and fits my son perfectly. The gloves and goggles make a great set. Very happy with this purchase.
2432,5,"this is the best fitting floorliner i have ever owned, the fit is unbelievable, i would highly recommend this product and would buy again"
2433,5,Cut the wind like a hot knife going into butter. The fit was great and easy to install.the race bubble can not be beat.
2434,5,"When I first got this, we had had numerous frosty mornings.  So I put this on and what do you know... it only rained.  lol<br />Anyway, when I finally got a frost, the side windows were frosty, the windshield, not at all.  It was marginally loose, hard wind doesn't work with this, but it still did the job on low wind, frosty days."
2435,3,"Ok, great item if it fits your bike or ATV.  The aluminum brackets are very well machined and fit the handle bars perfectly.  The directions can be a little confusing so read them twice.  Look to see if the bar has enough clearance for all of your handle bar accessories. DO a dry fit in the air and if does not fit you must abort and just forget handle bar hand guards from these folks. The 2013 Brute Force has too much stuff protruding to far out. So it DOES NOT FIT!"
2436,1,Took the part to my auto repair guy.The part does not fit......I am very disapointed with the results.Not good PR for Amizon
2437,5,"Well, this thing is easy to use and works great.  The build quality seems to be solid and I haven't had any issues with leaks.  You can't ask for much more."
2438,5,I ordered this and hoped that it would be just what i needed.. and it was.. it was way cheaper than I could get in a shop..<br />it looks just like the other side I'm happy with my purchase
2439,5,Worth the wait and fits and functions perfectly.  Now only if I could have gotten somebody else to do the install!
2440,3,"The shift knob is a dream. Looks good and feels awesome. But when I screwed it in, it stripped the threads in the knob. So ya better buy some super glue with it haha"
2441,5,"love it and it looks great on my truck. Its not too big and not too small, its perfect. completes my xterra"
2442,5,"Good quality, Its a larger than I had expected, I didn't realize the elephant in the center. Bonus in purchase, lol"
2443,4,"the gas cap looks nice, i hope it fits it looks like it will but havnt had chance to put it on"
2444,5,Item was received promptly. I was easy to replace the broken handle. Would recommend to corolla owners who need to replace their broker interior door handle.
2445,3,"The 2006 Mini Cooper (R53 body style) uses a 19\\"" wiper blade on the passenger side, and a 18\\"" on the driver side.<br /><br />The 19\\"" on the passenger side does not make contact with the windshield on the far end of the blade due to the extreme curvature of the Mini windshield.<br /><br />After further research it appears that all \\""beam\\"" type wiper blades have this problem on the Mini Cooper.<br /><br />Some Mini drivers run a 17\\"" blade on the passenger side to get around this issue.<br /><br />I opted instead for the PIAA Super Silicone wiper blades (also available from Amazon).  Only $5-$7 dollars more expensive, but with a 5 star rating and they do work on the Mini Cooper.<br /><br />Amazon's fantastic customer service accepted my return."
2446,5,Excellent original Delco replacement part at a better price than most knockoffs. Went straight on with no problems and looks like it came with the engine from new.
2447,5,I bought this hose and a water pressure regulator to replace a burst hose and no regulator.  It arrived quickly and is working great.  Seems very durable.
2448,3,Hopefully it will take of the problem on my bike once its installed. It does appear to be the solution. Your price was the best I found and shipping and quick delivery was excellent.
2449,5,It's great! Super easy to install and shipped quickly. Changes the look and feel of your interior immensely. Highly recommended!
2450,5,Installed it on my 91 Miata. Zero issues. Works well.
2451,4,"Took a little getting use to as I've always worn a fullface, for just around town it's great, comfortable and light weight."
2452,5,No instructions  -  The add said comes with instructions  Had to ask my motorcycle mechanic to figure it out for me.
2453,5,The Weathertech Floor Mats fit my 2011 Ford Escape PERFECTLY.<br />I STRONGLY Recommend the Weathertech Floor Mats for your Sports Utility Vehicle
2454,5,"I was building a new platform bed with storage underneath, similar to what you would find in many RVs.  We have a heavy and thick mattress, so I wanted something to help hoist it up, and then hold it once it was there.  It needs to operate easily enough for my wife to use regularly.  These worked out perfectly!  Just lift the bed a few inches, and the struts take it from there.  I couldn't be happier!"
2455,5,"I bought these mats for my 2001 Chevy Silverado Extended Cab 4x4. I wanted to make sure that the rear floor carpeting was protected from mud, snow, salt and sand on family vacations and trips. They fit absolutely perfectly in my Silverado! The mats do overlap in the middle but they really take to the contour of the floor and the overlapping is not an issue.<br /><br />These mats are heavy duty rubber that is strong and flexible. I like how water and dirt is channeled away from shoes and boots and is held in the mat for easy removal/emptying. Mine did not have a strong rubber smell, in fact I did not even notice a smell from them at all. I will be buying a matching set of these for the front of my truck too!  I like these better than Husky floor liners that I have had in other trucks because they are easier to remove and rinse out.<br /><br />SteveK"
2456,5,I had one of these in my YJ for years. Crackheads tried to steal my radio 3 times.they bent that crap out of the radio door but could never break into it. After doing a lot of work on my Jeep I left it out of the jeep and got taken with the garbage. Sp  I replaced it with the same thing because it worked so well at keeping the crackheads out.
2457,5,"My bike chain had not been clean in over 38 years. When I was 17,  I needed to find a easy way to clean a chain, now I know how now."
2458,5,My current car uses these headlights and the only local retailer is the dealership where i purchased my vehicle. Although they do sell similar bulbs they charge over 3x the price of this bulb. I can't attest to how long this bulb lasts but it is just as bright as the more expensive dealer option and a breeze to instal.
2459,5,I own a used car business and I buy a lot of cars from auctions and needed this to see what was wrong with them before purchasing and it was worked great.
2460,5,These are so very nice.  My grandson loved them.  Perfect gift. Arrived on time. Would use them again if needed.
2461,5,I Just received my dice in the mail. I am sooooo exciteddddd!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can't wait to put them in my car!!!
2462,5,This was a Christmas gift for my husband.  He is pleased with the product after only having it on his truck for a week now.
2463,3,"The bolts that you receive are not gold colored as pictured but silver. They come in the moroso package that way. The picture needs to be changed. I have not installed them yet, but I don't expect any issues."
2464,2,The mirror was great looking and the heater worked great but the mirror head was so loose that it vibrated in the wind going down the road. It is a sealed unit so there is not way to tighten the mirror head up. I had it on my truck exactly 1 day and then I went back to my old original mirror that the heater did not work.
2465,5,Cover is really nice and very soft and comfortable to the touch. It was very easy to put on too. I've read some reviews where some people had little difficulty putting it on. I slid a screwdriver between the cover and steering wheel and ran the screwdriver all around the steering wheel. The cover fit itself very easily this way.
2466,5,Thanks. Everything was great. I really appreciate it. It came fast and was exactly as described. thanks again. blah blah.
2467,5,"I ordered this for my 2007 Toyota Corolla, and fits perfectly. No &#34;fun house&#34; problem with the mirror glass like reviews for other models I've read. The only issue is that it's black where the other one is dark blue. You can only tell the difference if you're looking for it, but that's my &#34;stupid tax&#34; for backing out of the garage too fast...<br /><br />Just search on YouTube for instructions. 1A Auto has a perfect step by step video. It takes under 30 minutes start to finish."
2468,1,"We returned the product because it wasnt what we needed. We waited over a month for our refund and never received any correspondence about it. I called the seller and they said they already refunded me, but they hadnt. So i called amazon, and they said the refund was processed the day i called the seller. If you buy something from them, MAKE SURE IT IS WHAT YOU WANT! Getting a refund from them will be a big hassel"
2469,5,"Was an excellent buy for me.  Did exactly what is said it would do.  Checked the codes myself, then went to an auto repair shop to confirm that was the problem.  The repair shop used their machine to check my car and the code matched. I felt much better knowing before I went to the shop what my emission problem was.  Knew I wasn't going to pay for something unnecessarily."
2470,1,"Hardly on two weeks and it is pitting.  I might expect a bit of this if we had snow and there were chemicals on the road...but it hasn't even snowed here yet.  It is just typical China JUNK!<br />Update....now that it has been on a few months, I am throwing it in the trash.........looks awful on my beautiful car!"
2471,5,The lift struts were very easy to install and were as good as the original ones that came one the truck. These were exactly what I needed.
2472,5,I purchased this for a friend's Honda that was having major oil leakage from the distributor.  The factory O-rings were replaced but the car would leak after only a few months again.  The cylinder head is the location of the most hot part of an engine (the exhaust valve) and in this case the distributor shaft is pretty much spinning in scalding hot oil all of the time.  Allowing it to cure overnight at a minimum is suggested if you have the time.  The leak was gone and the liquid gasket was working well.  I have also used this stuff as an exhaust paste on joints and to seal the manifold to the cylinder head.  It stands up to heat very well.  I would not hesitate to use it again.
2473,4,"this does the job- installs easy and wont fly off like the window deflectors!  I was iffy to go with aftermarket, however this particular unit is most excellent!"
2474,5,"Led are bright and consumes less power, I am now using 50% led for my car's lightings and am planning to install and replace all lights from the interior of my car when i get the time."
2475,5,"Wired this up to our trailer, hooked it up to our old faithful Pathfinder, checked braking and signaling....Eureka!  You just gotta love it when a reasonably priced product installs and works exactly as promised."
2476,4,Product is as described; my only issue is that it did not come with the necessary bolts; more than likely if you don't have them you will need metric bolts. You can find the three you will need at your local hardware store. Seller should at least mention the size of the metric bolts needed.
2477,5,This is a very high quality decal that was received quickly and was even better than described. I bought it for my daughter's skateboard and she couldn't be happier.
2478,5,"This light is wonderful!! it is everything we were looking for. Very easy to install, and the light is very bright!"
2479,5,Bought this to keep an ATV battery charged throughout the winter.  I have had it plugged up and charging for a month now and it works like a champ!
2480,5,"After purchasing my 2006 Mercedes Benz C230 Sport, I decided to change my wearing breaks. I bought all 4 R1 Concept Rotors (2 Front Drilled, 2 Blank Rear) coupled with Beck Arnley Pads. The rotors are of excellent craftsmanship and I would recommend them for any Mercedes Benz (or any other vehicle with a similar application). Before posting my comment, I wanted to wait some time for the brakes to settle, as you do not have an accurate idea of how the brakes handle until they brake in. I'm happy to say that I am still 100% satisfied with them and will continue to purchase R1 products for my vehicles."
2481,5,"Love the fragrance, not over powering and seems to be keeping car smelling fresh.  Tried it as a room freshner also, nice!  Recommend you trying it."
2482,5,"this item is a good product,i will recommend others toward this item because it fits my car and a very reasonable price."
2483,5,"My WR250F's service manual tells me how many mm of fork oil there should be, so this product works perfectly for that.  Just set the depth on ring, and suck out excess fork oil.  It's easy to get a consistent measurement!"
2484,5,"This was what I wanted, same as manufacturer quality. Fitted directly into its place and changed the Dodge appearance to a greater look ."
2485,5,"Works well, just what I wanted<br /><br />You do need some room to fit it on the tire valve stem if its to tight it wont have room to fit."
2486,5,"Seriously, this is a must have for your hitch and haul.  When we travel to the Florida panhandle, we have 10 hours of travel time.  You always seem to run into a few little showers between Mobile and the panhandle, and keeping your items clean and dry is a great way to arrive to your vacation destination.<br /><br />The expandable cargo bag is very easy to use.  The over netting fits easily even when the bag is expanded to full capacity.  We always travel with 7 people, so we have this bag expanded out completely.  We have never had a problem fitting in our supplies, and trust me, 7 people traveling means a ton of stuff!  Very durable, and very easy.  When not in use, it compacts down very small for easy storage."
2487,5,I only use OEM parts on my cars.  this was a good deal. Everyone should use OEM parts for safety.
2488,1,"I had misplaced my key for this lock and took a simple household hammer to see if I could get the lock off.  To my amazement, 1 simple swing from the hammer and the lock popped off.  Do not purchase this lock.  I would recommend the California Immobilizer."
2489,5,"I was concerned about the term &#34;modern&#34; in the description as I have an older camp trailer, but decided to take a chance.  I needed the mounting bracket also, and liked that it was included in the package.  This item arrived safely and quickly, was exactly as described and installed easily."
2490,3,"Go to a hardware store, get some chrome or black mesh, some JB weld, zip ties, and zip tie fasteners. Pull off your grill and have at it. I have this product for about 6 months and it still looks good. I did jb weld it so it wouldn't come off."
2491,5,These re my favorites for my company from inside trim work to outside roofing and framing.  I gives a quality feel no matter the weather.
2492,5,I went for a late season ride up here in Buffalo about 200 miles this was the most comfortable half helmet I have ever worn in some 35 years I have been riding since I was in the Navy 1975 and always had a bike and plenty of helmets through the years this one is definitely a keeper
2493,5,"I don't know how to write a good review on a sticker but here's my attempt. It came from the maker and I got it quick. The directions were very clear and easy to understand. It's been on the back window of my car in the Midwest and has stayed on through insane summer heat and ridiculous winter cold. Snow, ice, auto car wash as well as hand wash and its still right where I put it with no peeling."
2494,5,I was able to finally get up my leaves.  I was tired of using the leaf blower and now I don't have to.
2495,4,"While this quick strut works like the original it was a bit twisted for installation and required quite a bit of muscling to make it fit. Now that it is in place I don't know that I could tell the difference between this and the spring/strut that came with the car in terms of handling. It seems to have several more coils than the original, but this has mot affected performance as best I can tell."
2496,4,"Got mine in May of 2010, one lasted til Nov of 2012, Other one is still going... I don't think 2 1/2 years is horrible... saw other reviews on here about them only lasting 4-6 months, maybe I got lucky. But the one that burned out did burst instead of just burning out."
2497,4,"Decent product, great value...minutes to install and seconds to remove...saw a very similar product in the Harley book for $319.00, need I say more?"
2498,4,"fit great for old 1946 willys which is hard to come by plus it was a great price. I'll be buy more parts here, i have a 46,51 & 53 willys jeeps"
2499,5,I bought these and it took a little time putting them on but once they were all hooked up WOW!!!! I was very impresed with the product. I have more compliments on them than anything else and pair them with some halo headlights and its a great match.
2500,4,"This a sharp-looking vest for a reasonable price.  The stitching is secure, and the sizing is accurate.  The dye does not rub off onto clothes or flesh.  Overall, we are very happy with this purchase."
2501,4,This is a great tool for a little peace of mind at home.  We have used it on 3 of our vehicles as well as on our friends cars.  It is nice to know what's wrong before you start messing around and whether or not the problem is serious.
2502,5,"works fantastic, small design is great, multiple charge modes- restore mode works great for neglected batteries and brought my Optima blue top back to perfect condition.  better than spending $150 for a new one.  now I rotate between 3 batteries monthly to keep them all in 100% charged condition."
2503,3,"This is my second pump of this type.  the first one lasted only 12 uses.  This one is on its 2nd so far.  The only problem with it is the suction tube could be about 6 inches longer.  It is almost impossible to empty a 5 gallon gas can with this pump.  If it lasts longer than one year, i would rate this item 4 stars,  but due to the short suction tube, its only a 3."
2504,5,"Perfect fit. Comes with the plastic retaining clips that you will need when the old ones break as you remove the old filter. Good price, good product."
2505,5,"Great product.  Used it for ceiling fans, window sills, and ledges on very tall ceilings (35').  Shakes out easily after use.  Cleans up nicely with mild soap when it gets really dirty.  Fits the LongArm pole perfectly.  Have not noticed any unusual smell at all to the product.  Bends nicely to reach ledges and ceiling fans.  Seems like a sturdy/quality product.  No complaints at all with the duster."
2506,3,"Paid for the ACDelco name, it wasn't much different from an Autozone water pump. The fittings at the top were cast, OE had pressed in tubes made of steel. The casting was rough and the hoses had to be tightened until the clamps nearly broke to stop it from leaking. It set on the front cover nice and flat and doesn't leak now. Hardly worth paying for the ACDelco name anymore, they used to make good replacement parts for GM cars, now it looks like they've whored themselves into the gutter with other no-name products."
2507,5,This cap looks like the advertised picture. It runs very small. I would say it is a perfect fit for a Teenager or someone that is of smaller size. The material is great!
2508,5,This decal was the perfect size I was looking for. Very easy to apply. I wanted something other than the typical family decals. I saw Snoopy and just had to have it.
2509,2,"The leads on the switch are to short and to stiff.  The connectors should be turned so that they go straight on the fuse lugs without having to bend the stiff wires and have them creating pressure so that they slip of after a while. For the price it works but could be improved upon using more flexable wire and bifferent connectors, both of which are available."
2510,4,I bought this tach for 2 reasons ; 1 i remember the name from the past everybody had a sun tach on their dash and 2 the price and the fact that i needed an electric tach to replace my mech. tach ; only thing i don't like is Sun is no longer made in the USA its from china ; so when i have the extra money i will change over to Auto-meter but for now it works.
2511,5,"We love our new motorhome vent. Pretty easy installation. We purchased this to replaced an older faded vent when the hardware cracked then broke. The bright white brightened up and gave the inside a newer look. The hardest part of the installation was removing the older putty/caulking. It took nearly an hour to scrape off, but once off the rest was a breeze. Be sure to install it the opening facing the rear. We also loved the great price and the speedy delivery with our 2 day Prime Membership. I might add that the job was easier with the putty tape that also included new screws which you will appreciate."
2512,4,"Got these for my 10 year old car, and the floors now look like new.  If you aren't sure which color to purchase, look at the Honda website, which will tell you where to find the colors for your car.  On my car there was a sticker inside the drivers side door with the color code information."
2513,4,GREAT LOOK AFTER A LOT OF CUSTOMIZING TO FIT THE BUMPER HOLES. LUCKY I HAD IT INSTALLED AT A PROFESSIONAL SHOP SO THEY COULD RE-ENGINEER THE PIPE BENDS TO FIT THESE HOLES. MAYBE THE CAT BACK SYSTEM WOULD HAVE FIT BETTER THAN AXLE BACK.
2514,5,I've tried aftermarket PCV valves and they never last as long as the AC Delcos.  Change your PCV valve regularly and it will pay for itself with fuel efficiency.  One vehicle I had made a 2.5 mpg difference with a new AC Delco PCV valve.
2515,5,I've used this blow up more tires than i can count.<br />I've jumped started the zero turn lawm mover.<br />I've used it to power the electric jack on the travel trailer.<br />Worked flawlessly for all the above.<br />I buy another without hesitation!
2516,5,"New washer did not fit close enough to the wall with the new hoses that were installed.  Husband looked in our area stores but they did not carry anything that would work.<br />Found this item online here, ordered, came quickly and was just the thing we needed.  Elbows put on and washer moved closer to the wall."
2517,5,"the tote just came in today.  Free PRIME two day shipping.  The condition on AMAZON said used, in good conditon.  The small print was that the box was damaged.  So what did I get?  A brand new tote in a beat-up box.  An inventory of all parts were made, and everything was present and accounted for.  I am happy with my purchase.  The reason I chose this one over the thetford was because this one has the bayonet valve to control the release, rather than keeping some point in the discharge hose elevated higher than the level of the liquid until the hose could be secured in the drain before lowering the high point to commense the discharge.  This just seems a little easier and a little less likely for an unplesant discharge.  Now I am off to harbor freight to buy their garden cart  to mount this on to solve the hard rubber wheel that so many people are unappy with."
2518,5,an excellent replacement for my stock cat the price is awesome!my brother is a mechanic and he said the price was the best even.
2519,5,"I bought the bike with 1900 miles on it and the previous owner had installed a Vance and Hines header, but they didn't rejet it.I bought the jet kit and had the new jets installed. The throttle responce has increased and the power is a little more. Money well spent."
2520,3,"It was a bit of a struggle to get these boots on when I first got them, but after a couple more tries I got the hang of it.  Unfortunately I soon discovered that the velcro flaps meant to cover the laces and add ankle support were about half an inch too short to fit over my foot.  Now normally, I would associate this with having ordered the wrong size, but no...there is plenty of room inside the shoe.  Almost too much room in fact, because I can not only wiggle my toes, but the top half of my foot.  The laces fit over the ankle with enough room to tie them into a neat little bow...I just can't close the darn velcro.<br /><br />So, I don't suggest them for someone with a tall dorsum like me.  That, or ignore the advice to go a size smaller, stick with your actual shoe size, and deal with the slightly too large sole."
2521,4,Just used it during a 5 day ride and it was great - for extra security I used a motorcycle cargo net.
2522,5,It's looks great on my car. With very good view on mu car.when my friend saw it they asked my from wher did i got it. I told them the wibside they dafenitly going to by from it.
2523,5,These shades are much nicer than I thought they would be. They are super comfy and look great. And you have 3 pairs to help you with different types of days.
2524,5,"I have always been diligent about maintaing my vehicles including their appearance.  And NOW I get compliments where ever I go!  I used the polisher the first weekend I had it and I love it.  It was easy to use and the results were fabulous.  If I had known it was this easy to get results like this, I would have picked it up long ago.<br /><br />This is a must have for any car enthusiast!"
2525,3,"I'm having the same problem as some of the others here, threads pulling apart. It looks like it will hold up but not very reassuring when it starts to unravel the first time it's used."
2526,5,"I was looking at these online and a lot of people were saying that the sizes were off, so I went to the local Cyclegear store in my city and tried them on to make sure they fit.  They fit perfectly a half size up from my size.. I've had them for about a month now, and they're great!<br /><br />comfort: As far as comfort, they are pretty good.  They dont push on my ankles or rub any toes the wrong way.  They do great on long rides as well as short rides.  at first they were a little stiff, but that's to be expected with anything leather.  Now that they're broken in, they are flexible and comfortable.  They are also quite breathable.  There is another version of this boot with more perforation in the leather, but I wanted a boot that could be worn year round and the sales rep said that the perf. version would be really cold in cooler temps.<br /><br />quality: The zipper and the stitching are holding up well, and the sole of the boot doesnt show any signs of coming undone from the bottom of the boot.  The soles are starting to show some wear, but its not excessive.<br /><br />I will definitely be buying another pair of these if they are still around when mine wear out.  I would recommend them to everyone with a motorcycle."
2527,4,"Item looks good and is as described, easy to install and appears it will perform as expected. Price was good, but again you get what you pay for. The problem I have is the stake holes do not line up with the bed. The Cap holes are about 1/2\\"" too far forward, covering about 1/8\\"" of the bed holes. This won't be a problem as I probably won't put anything in the holes anyway, but it looks off. Appears that the adheasive strips will hold very firmly and hopefully will give me many years of protection."
2528,5,"I own a 2012 Evolution GSR, and after doing some research from the forums I bought this specifically as a heat shield for my cobb intake. (It will work on pretty much on all other circular shaped cones as well. It attaches to the circumference of the cone itself or at the base of the cone where it attaches to the intake's piping. Depends on how you customize your heat shield) For those that don't know, when you have an open cone filter for the evo x without a heatsink, sometimes the car stutters when the A/C is on. This is due to the hot air being blown in towards the intake from the fans right below. The shield did not fit right away of course, I bought this well knowing I will have to do a bit of customization. All I needed was a metal cutting saw (same ones that can cut pipes), black spray paint (bought one with high heat tolerance), and something to sand down the edges after cutting. Overall I am very pleased with the results. The product was sturdy, and pretty solid. Metal was pretty easy to work with and chew through. Works like a charm now. This is one of the best cost effective solutions to finding yourself a heat shield."
2529,4,Just bought 2 of these belts.  One for a Prairie 700 and one for a Suzuki Twin Peaks 700 (they're the same bike by different makers).  I've used these belts before.  Dayco belts are reliable and dependable.
2530,4,I love my eyelashes but they didn't last me a day was on the highway and it beat them off the air pressure going 70 mph but will order another pair.
2531,5,"Very happy with the product.  Arrived quickly and adds that little extra flare for the 2012 Dodge Charger.  I didnt think people would even notice something as small as a valve stem cap, but they do!"
2532,3,"Let me start off by saying that Powersport Superstore got these to me in 3 days!<br /><br />I bought these adapters at the same time as my Kuryakyn Scythe mirrors for my 06 Yamaha Warrior. It looks like these adapters are made of quality stainless steel (better be at this price!), but if you don't want to have exposed threads and a SS nut in view, I would look elsewhere.  I have fat drag bars[[ASIN:B002CUW8R4 Baron Custom Accessories RadiUs Enferno Drag Bar, Handle Bar Size: 1 1/4in. BA-7304-03]] and chrome levers and housings and all my wires are tucked away for a clean look.  I have gone so far as to have chrome covers on all my exposed allen head bolts.  So exposed stainless steel threads and a nut was a distraction for me.  The mirrors look great, but the adapters detract from the look and it makes it seems that I cobbled stuff out of a scrounge bin to fit the mirrors.  I ended up going with an adapter made by Drag Specialties. [[ASIN:B0064REM6G Drag Specialties Stealth Mirror Adapter (CHROME)]] It still has a large lock nut on it, but it is sleeved to cover up the threads between my brake housing and the mirror itself.  Very clean install and the chrome matches mirror and bars a little better."
2533,1,I would not recommend this product to anyone.  It tore the first time we put it on the car.  We have not used it since and just feel like we have wasted our money.
2534,1,I instaled this air system I pumped it up to pressure and filled my bicycle<br /><br />tires twice and the pump will not start again it just buzzes. The motor  will<br /><br />not turn over. And I lost my mail in warranty card.
2535,5,Arrived early! It's perfect! My girlfriend loved it!! I would definitely recommend this product. Sticks on window pretty well. Could also be placed on vehicle as well.
2536,5,It worked great .Before we got the wineguard we had so much trouble setting up satellite dish. This was so easy .
2537,5,"These are very good prefixed stripes that have stood up nicely to the weather. Not too difficult to apply if one takes time to layout work and prepare surfaces to directions. Will look great on vehicle and have really splashed up the Dodge Charger (did I mention we got a great spoiler here on Amazon, also?), making a rather plain silver sedan into a real headturner. Will make your hotrod so much more valuable to you in really personal, affectionate way. Note: Get the good squeegee, will be very useful getting out the bubbles on installation."
2538,1,Fast shipping good fit easy install poor chrome rusting in a month to bad they looked really good if your getting dragbars for a sportster id go shorter they are a little long
2539,5,"The choke wasn't working worth a hoot (wouldn't pull off when cold) on my classic 1976 Firebird Formula and I traced the problem to an old, non-functioning stock choke pull-off.  This part arrived within days and was the exact replacement of the original.  It was simple to install and now my choke workes perfectly.  Couldn't ask for anything better, faster or less expensive.  Thanks Amazon!!!"
2540,5,If you have a jeep you know that there is always a need to strap something to a roll bar.<br />Having these in your jeep at all times ensures that you are ready - and they look and work far better than bungie cords.<br />Indispensable.
2541,4,"i bought this for my car in the Philippines. unfortunately, i was too smitten with the way it looks that i totally forgot that the size of our plates here are different than the ones in the staes. my bad. otherwise, 5 stars"
2542,5,"Contrary to what it states on Amazon, this filter DOES fit an 06 Rabbit (2.6L engine, PZEV). It is made in POLAND and compared to Mann Evotop HU719/6x oil filter, it seems to be of higher quality. The spacing of the filter ridges is almost half that of the Mann filter (1 to 1.5mm vs 2mm) which basically means the WIX product has a larger filtering surface. It could also mean it's more restrictive to oil flow, but I don't really think that's the case since I've seen home-made filters with toilet paper rolls work just fine (actually a LOT better). It does come with a gasket as pictured."
2543,2,"I bought this back in February in anticipation of installing it in the summer. Well, now that time has come, and the thing doesn't even fit. It's way too long for the application. Now I can't get my money back. Shame on this company."
2544,5,Easy to install... Looks fantastic... Highly recommend this product to go with a pair of HID kit and to give your ride that finishing touch!
2545,5,IT FITS...IT WORKS...IT GOES ALL THE WAY AROUND THE STEERING WHEEL AND IT LOOKS GOOD. COLOR COORDINATION IS ALSO GOOD.
2546,5,"This worked as advertised, was the cheapest one I could find and service was awesome. This was a Very Easy install. No complaints here."
2547,5,"I used this on my car's upholstery, and it worked well. Stiff enough to scrub and big enough to cover a decent area, and the handle was comfortable in my hand."
2548,5,"Great Product, my cars paint never felt that good before, great quality. Make sure to use their shampoo as well, as others might be more aggressive on removing this wax, which you want to avoid at all cost. Does not leave residue on rubber/ black molding. Use the Einszett Polishing first and turn your polisher on low with no pressure. In my opinion, little application of this product by hand works best. This bottle will last you a long time...."
2549,5,"Fits like a well made glove on my 2012 Ram 1500. Easy application, no issues with the sticky tape. Just closely follow instruction and its easy. I did mark a center point on the shade with a pencil to aid with alignment when applying to hood. Its fits very tight to the hood, none of the protector actually goes under the hood."
2550,5,I bought this on the fact of other positive reviews. I will use it down the road on another project bike. It will be interesting to see how it compares with OEM Kawasaki  anti freeze that looks the same as Prestone.
2551,4,I'm glad to report that this device connects to both my GM and Lincoln vehicle and is a good tool. It's nice to know at a quick glance how things effect engine parameters without having to drag out the laptop and go for a ride.<br /><br />My GM is a boosted application and I can monitor knock retard in seconds as well as a host of other parameters. I use the Android Torque Application with this device and for the price you can't go wrong. If you're a car guy (or gal) and understand (or want to learn) what ODB2 parameters mean then this is for you.<br /><br />If you want to keep the repair men honest you can read your trouble code before you bring your car into the shop. If you have a difficult to track problem you can data log and view at a later date to see what tripped the fault code. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is the price point.
2552,5,I love this wallet.  It holds so much and can go through just about anything.  I've had it for a long time now and it still looks brand new after going through hell and back.  I would definitely recommend this product!
2553,5,"A few things to consider when installing this hitch.  The instructions are correct in every way.  The part you have to pay special attention to is chasing the threads on the welded nuts in the frame before installing the hitch.  On a brand-new vehicle this is simple.  One that has a few miles and a bit of underbody rust, not so much.  The twenty minute install time is for a clean and new vehicle.  If it's an older one you'll wind up using tools most DIY types simply do not own.  Don't be shocked if a garage bills you for a full hour of labor to install it.  On the bright side, it's light enough that you can easily lift it into place and start a couple of bolts.  It's a piece of cake once you have the threads chased and a couple of bolts started.<br /><br />The finish is nice, the fit is perfect.  The hitch extends a bit beyond the bumper and that's a good thing for me."
2554,5,"I purchased this oil filter socket tool for my 2010 Toyota Venza and was amased at how easy it made changing my oil filter. It works exactly as advertised. If you are a Do-it-Yourself person, I Highly recomend you get one."
2555,5,Great buy on these large size filters.  Fast shipping - will be re-ordering from this supplier.  These fiberglasses work well for those of us that want to change out our filters monthly.  Good value for the money!
2556,5,"The product is fantastic. Dropped right into the car, and opposed to the manufacturer's filter, this one is washable and provides better air flow."
2557,1,"it did not work  I don't know if I got a bad one, perhaps already returned.  It said it was 100 charged but was not and couldn't light a bulb for more than 20mins!<br /><br />Amazon however were wonderful about the return"
2558,5,Love my decal! I can't begin to express the looks and laughter I get when people notice it on my window! Even my managers think it's hilarious! (I work at a car dealership.)
2559,5,Put these on the wife's car. She loves them. Guys at her work like them too. Easy and secure mounting.
2560,1,I installed this unit in my RV...Installation was easy and the noise level was acceptable....It ran for 2 nights before it seized up...
2561,5,"This is a good mirror for the money, I like the ratchet style tightening system too.  Pretty good quality also."
2562,5,"Not really a review.  Just wanted to add that this product does, indeed, fit a 2007 Corolla.  Happy that I didn't have to go to the dealer and overpay for such a small part of the car."
2563,5,"Took this to local locksmith shop with one of the OEM keys that came with the car (RAV4). Locksmith charged me about $5 to cut it.  Thought I would have to program it, but seems to start the car without programming.  A much smarter alternative than buying a replacement key at a Toyota dealer given the dealer's absurd pricing."
2564,4,"The covers look great and are made of quality material. The covers slightly larger than the stock plastic covers, and they press into my upper legs a bit making riding, and espeially stopping, a little bit uncomfortable. This might not be a problem for someone who is tall, but probably will bother the shorter riders like me."
2565,5,"Quick shipping as always. Good fit, nice and snug. I would buy it again. Curious to see how it holds up in the Florida sun without UV material."
2566,3,"Product arrived on-time from amazon. Purchased this for an old motorcycle that I was tired of swapping chargers with.  I opted to give this one a try because of all the positive reviews.  This charger is just a poorly made product.  Even though is was $20, and less than other brands I have purchased, I think it is a waste of money. First, it says it is for agm batteries, but only charges a battery at 14.3v.  Agm's need a higher voltage than this (in fact all batteries need a higher voltage than this). Second, it would not bring my battery up to a full charge. Lastly, the charger runs really hot, so I was afraid to leave this connected for a long period of time. Frustrated, I decided to open up the charger, and to my surprise, all there is is a transformer and a diode.  For a transformer in a box, I should have paid a lot less."
2567,1,"From the moment i started to use it, i have problems with the alarm. Some times did not activate when i placed into the brake disc. Only after three or four times, the alarm activate. One day, after one week using it, the alarm activate even without any movement in my bike. Any time I placed into the disc, the alarm start activate and does not stop until i remove from the disc.<br />I can't return it to the seller because I leave in Venezuela and is going to be too expensive to send it back to US.<br />Spanish:<br />Desde el primer momento que instale la alarma en mi moto ha presentado problema. Muchas veces la alarma no activaba , si no luego de tres o cuatro veces de colocar y quitar. Un día amaneció con la alarma pegada sin que nadie estuviese moviendo la moto y la única forma de desactivarla era quitando el candado de la moto. Cada vez que coloco el candado, la alarma comienza a sonar.<br />Lamentablemente estoy en Venezuela y no puedo retornar el producto porque saldría muy costoso el envió."
2568,5,It is quality and the installation was simple.  I received the product within days of ordering and I have been very happy with this product since.
2569,5,"Don't be fooled by the picture. Mount did not look anything like the picture. Installation instructions come with the mount for warn and another type of winch. I used a Badlands 3000# winch from Harbor Freight and it fit perfectly on my 2008 Polaris Sportsman 700twin EFI x2. Just make sure you line up the four holes in the right spot so that the winch is as centered on the mount as possible. The mount does not come with bolts to mount the winch directly onto it. Use the bolts that come with the winch. If you're using the Badlands winch, do not use longer bolts than the ones provided, you may end up cracking the bolt ear, unfortunately, I learned the hard way. Luckily for me, replacing the winch at HF was very easy, no questions asked. Just swapped out winch for winch. Did not have to remove all the cables I had already mounted to the ATV. Installing and removing the winch from the ATV after installing it onto the mount is a snap. Just four self tapping bolts and you're done. I recommend this winch mount. It is very sturdy and very thick."
2570,5,"This came on time, and was easy to replace.  I couldn't get it quite as snug as the tail light I was replacing, but that is probably operator error..."
2571,5,"This gear is great and the service was excellent too! We are very happy with all the MX gear we purchased, but would (next time) be more careful about sizing the gloves - which turned out to be too small."
2572,2,"Would not work on our 2003 Monaco Camelot.  Three of us tried to get them into place, but could not get them in :("
2573,5,"Got the Meguiar's Professional Dual Action Polisher and a bunch of the different 7\\"" pads. Unfortunately, they would NOT stick to the backing plate that came with the DA over 3,000 rpm like they are supposed to for the cutting compound to be used. Meguiar's sent me the 6\\"" backing plate for the DA and they stuck to that like glue. I put all these pads I used right in the washing machine and they came out like new. I did purchase a Meguiar's Cut N' Shine 8\\"" Wool Buffing Pad to use on my old rotary \\""grinder\\"" in case I have to do deep scratches again. (All this was for a 2005 Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor that I got from the auction and had to buff out.) Also, if you're using Meguiar's 205 and wet sand with 1,200 to 1,500 or greater paper, like they say to do, it will be MUCH easier to get the scratches out. I used some 3,000 and sanded in a straight line (not swirls) and I did get a nice smooth finish. Just remember to tape off the hard corners and where the body parts meet so you don't grind the paint off! And, yes, I am talking from experience!!! I used this pad with Meguiar's 105 finishing polish."
2574,1,"The Fumoto oil drain valve I received from this seller (PIXUS, Inc.) was inoperative/defective. The lever absolutely can not be moved out of its detent notch. I have used one of these valves on a previous personal vehicle, and it was very convenient. I will be returning this one, however, as it is a $26.40 quality control failure."
2575,5,These mats do say Ram on them. We have a dodge ram so Ok with us but maybe if you have a different model you might not want. Look good.
2576,2,"I couldn't believe these were for sale, scrolling through my review history. After maybe 6 months or a year, these will corrode, and they will eventually stop making contact with your battery post. The slots actually get wider, necessitating larger screws and bending the metal more and more until they simply just can't hold on to the battery post any more. 3 of my friends bought these, and all had the same thing happen. I'm glad I've switched to batteries with the thread in type terminals, remembering the head ache this put me through."
2577,5,"The last time I bought new control levers for my Kawasaki Vulcan the OEM control lever cost me $45 at the dealer for 1, I got the pair for less than $27.00 with S+H. 1 piece construction instead of hinged 2 pc makes it simpler and simple is always better.  Fit perfect, thicker and wider than OEM and they look super cool.  The skull tips are bad ass! ! ! !"
2578,5,"My old factory one was leaking at the halves. Replaced with this one. Works great! No problems so far, been a month since replaced. Very reasonably priced, was half the price local is."
2579,5,Parking placard protects Handicap placard so the hook does not brake.  It is so fast and easy to display..  I keep my card in my side door and when I park I just take it and it connects to the magnet hooked over the review mirror.
2580,5,"This is the 3rd system I tried for my stratoliner(2-1 rush slipon pipe very loud) and let me tell you it is worth every dollar. I wanted to read a review that told me what I now know. 1.Easy to put on. 2.Loud and clear (i use an Iphone)3. Unit is from a canadian company(vancouver gets alot of rain)4. It LOOKS GREAT. 5.If you dont want it on bike you unplg and remove the batwing and down the road you go.In my opinion this is a nobrainer to buy. So all of you that were or are on the fence like I was, Your search is over, so buy it and enjoy the TUNES. 70-80mhp still clear.Oh and crank it up!!!!!"
2581,5,Product is exactly as advertised.  Nice look and design.  It was a gift so I can't say how it is holding up.
2582,5,"This product is great for price.  Easy to adjust fit with primitive tools.  Very happy with overall outcome of system.  Unexpected high decibel level (straight pipe sound) After adding inner baffle and poly wrapping, exhaust system is great!"
2583,3,"I bought these (w/ stake holes) for my '04 Silverado reg cab short bed. They look really nice and all, but the holes didn't line up very well. couple inches off. No big deal for me, but if you were gonna put something in those holes, it might be a big deal. It required a little trimming on the edge close to the truck to fit right. Good product, overall, for the price."
2584,5,this key came fast but no instructions.... copy was made and now i have to take it to a dealership/locksmith to get it programmed... but great quality!
2585,4,"It has not been installed long, but it is working fine so far, and was half the price of the auto parts store's replacement."
2586,1,Looks good went on kinda hard but ended up scratching my brand new mustang so I took it off complete waste.
2587,2,"The frame itself looks ok, however I was disappointed to find out that the logo on the frame is just a sticker, not actually etched into the frame.<br /><br />From the the description, I had made the mistaken assumption that \\""Brushed chrome aluminum etched look attached on the frame\\"" meant the frame was etched, not that a sticker had been put on the frame.<br /><br />The low price ultimately got me to buy, but I was suspicious, so instead of buying one for the front and one for the back, I only ordered one.  Glad I did that, and I don't plan on ordering the other.  Once the sticker comes off, hopefully it will be a nice clean frame, but I could have gotten a Made In China blank frame that for half the price."
2588,3,"I bought these to use in RV ceiling fixtures, expecting the 13 5050 LEDs to be brighter than the T10 1415WW bulbs with smaller SMT LEDs.  They weren't as bright, AND were noticably blue-tinged.  On the plus side, these look well built, and arrived in good packaging and were shipped quickly."
2589,5,Poor ole Nell<br />Slipped on some gel<br />Hit her head<br />And went to hell<br /><br />We worked this hose<br />Deep down the line<br />And pulled her out just in time<br />Covered in soot<br />And bright red grime<br /><br />This Camco kit<br />Is a perfect fit<br />It cleaned up all<br />That bright red sh!/<br /><br />Now she sits and prays<br />And has plenty to say<br />About that day<br />She was washed away
2590,4,"These lights are awesome looking! Super bright and they give my truck a whole new look for a great price. But it did take some work to get them to fit. I put these on my 91 Silverado and I had to use a dremel tool to fabricate the framework on my truck. There was a middle bracket I had to take out and a few notches off some of the corners to help the wires and led heat shield clear but that was it. I would say a good 1.5-2.0 of work but it was well worth it. I get compliments on them almost daily. The only other thing is I wish the tint was just a tiny bit darker but I think I'm going to put a really light layer of tint on them and that will do the trick. Also just as a side note, if your concerned about your stock tail lights not fitting because of having to fabricate the tail light housing framework don't worry about it. Mine still fit just fine; they fit nice and tight just like they did before and still light up just like they should."
2591,5,The filter looked and fit exactly like the Honda original. Price was WAY better than Honda or local auto parts outlets.
2592,1,"I bought these for my son who wanted some riding gloves for his ATV as part of his birthday. He is very easy on the ATV and does not hotdog it. After 30 minutes or so of riding, he came in to show me the gloves. Three different seams had separated and almost all of the rubberized material on the palm and fingers were gone. I usually check reviews before purchasing something and did not this time. This time it bit me. Please take heed - these were returned for a refund after less than an hour of use. That is totally unacceptable product quality. Avoid the hassle because if you buy these, you will be returning them for a refund."
2593,2,"I ORDERED AN 8' TRUCK BED COVER, BUT THEY SENT A 6'. TO MUCH TROUBLE TO SEND BACK. I'M STUCK WITH IT AT A COST OF ROUGHLY $66.00. NICE BED MAT BUT TO SMALL."
2594,5,The installation of lights was relatively easy (simple YouTube search on this). The lights worked w/o any issue and are bright. Would definately recommend and buy again.
2595,4,"My headlights were not extremely bad, so all of the kits with sandpaper and other aggressive stuff were overkill for my needs.<br /><br />I tried applying the blue magic both by hand and with a buffer-drill attachment.  It worked good with both methods.  Expect to apply it at least 4 or 5 times for good results.<br /><br />Just be sure to wash your headlights to get any loose dirt off before you do anything (I suspect the people who claim it destroyed their headligths simply rubbed dirt into their lights).<br /><br />Also be sure to get the Blue Magic Sealer.<br /><br />THIS STUFF DOES WORK, AND IS A GOOD VALUE FOR THE PRICE, JUST DON'T EXPECT ANY MIRACLES.  ALSO DON'T EXPECT IT TO MAKE YOUR LIGHTS PERFECT.  I'd say it removed 80-90% of the imperfections."
2596,3,"When it works, it's great.  I installed them in my 2010 TL April of 2011.  After the extremely mild winter, I thought they'd last another couple of years.<br /><br />but even after a winter that saw like 1 inch of snow, they started to streak just like every other cheap wiper blade.  I wiped the blades clean and they still streak...making them unusable when it rains.  I get better visibility when I keep the wipers off.<br /><br />I'll try some other brands this time...any suggestions?"
2597,4,"The iolite gadget works good for what it is intended.  It took me a bit to get used to not having smoke, but that was the intent."
2598,5,exactly as I ordered and fast shipping.  My only complaint is I wish there was an option of buying the brake and clutch lever as a set instead of making two orders.
2599,3,"I purchased one of these kits previously for my 2000 Dodge Grand Caravan that threw its serp belt every time we drove it in the rain. I had a mechanic install it, and it worked great for 9 months. Then one morning I was driving to work. I looked in my rearview mirror and saw smoke billowing out of my van. I stopped, looked under the hood and discovered a shredded belt and the remains of my tensioner and idler pulleys. I had the van towed to a shop where they found my water pump had froze up and destroyed the belt and pulleys.<br /><br />I had them install the original equipment belt and pulleys when they replaced the water pump, but this time I had them install an aftermarket Dorman shield on the tensioner pulley. Well, every time it rained, the belt started slipping off again.<br /><br />I bought this kit again but this time I decided to follow the instruction others placed here and install it myself. I procrastinated a couple months, dreading the job. When I finally got up the nerve to do it, I discovered the kit had NO IDLER PULLEY. A trip to NAPA and 20 bucks later, I had the necessary parts.<br /><br />I followed the instructions on here that directed the wiper tray and alternator to be removed. This was a huge pain but it worked. Some reviews mentioned working from under the vehicle. This seemed impossible with my van. I could see the nut from below but could not get a wrench on it. The only way was from above. My van had an 18 mm nut on the tensioner bolt (not 15 mm others had). I had to run to Advance Auto and buy one because my wrench set had 17 and 19 mm wrenches but no 18 mm. I then had to saw off 3 in of the new wrench (open end) because it was too long, even with the alternator and wiper tray removed.<br /><br />I finally got everything back together with no extra parts! It works great, but we haven't had any rain since that time.<br /><br />My advice. 1. Check that the kit is complete when you first receive it. 2. Pay someone else to install it unlessup you love a challenge and have alot of metric tools."
2600,5,I got a couple yards for my 86 BMW restoration. The quality is definitely automotive grade and great as an OEM replacement. The tan is a little darker than expected but close enough for the job.
2601,1,"I've used this grease before and think it is a decent product, but this is the first time I have purchased it from Amazon and it will be the last time.  The grease was included as part of a larger order and Amazon put the grease tubes in the box with everything else loose.  The tubes were crushed by the other items, leaving the grease unusable and creating a real mess.  It took a long time to clean the grease off of the rest of my order.  The problem was not with the shipper, as the outside carton was in perfect shape.  The problem was that Amazon packed this with a larger item that was not secured inside the package causing the grease cartridges to be crushed and spread through out the other products ordered.  This made for an expensive order and it is safe to say I am not a happy customer!<br /><br />While I am a long time Amazon customer, this will definitely be the last time I order grease from them and I will have to think long and hard before I order anything else."
2602,2,"bought this product but not happy with it. it fits pretty nice on the tank and is not in the way while im riding but nothing was sent in the box to redice vibration on the camera. there are a few 0 rings but does not tke the vibration away. I tried 2 diferent cameras and they both did the same thing, too much vibration and video was blurry due to the ecess vibration I would not recomend this product."
2603,1,"As a microfiber towel substitute, I thought this absorber towel would completely suck up every bit of water after rinsing the car, but it didnt. Even being mostly dry and wringing out as much water as I could from the towerl, it still left streaks of water which I had to finish drying off with a microfiber towel.<br /><br />Also, I followed instructions and left it a bit damp inside the plastic bottle then it grew mold all over the towel after not using it for 3 weeks. Ended up throwing it away. I was only been able to use it twice."
2604,5,"Ordered on a tuesday, installed it that thursday.  Very pleased with this product.  Very well-made and bolted on to the truck in 20 minutes (after the old flange bolts were ground off).  Very pleasant tone inside and out for a 4cyl.  Not \\""ricey\\"" at all.  I highly recommend this product.  I used OEM bolts with springs to attach this system to the cat.  Gibson does provide bolts in the kit, but I liked the OEM better, they looked stronger."
2605,5,Stock ride comfort with height adjustment. Install was easy with help of m3forum. Included instructions left lots to be desired.
2606,3,"This frame sits behind the license plate and it just disappears from view.  I think with a plastic cover it would look nice, but in California they are not legal."
2607,5,"I bought this product because, I had purchased a Bulldog Alarm system for my MGB. Well, after nearly five years of daily use the transmitter finally 'bit the dust' but, I must say the alarm unit is still doing it's job. I was glad that I found another transmitter to replace my old one, and at a reasonable price, I might add. I Would highly recommend any of the Bulldog products to any of my friends."
2608,5,"These footpegs are of typical Fastway quality, Topnotch.. They fit perfect and come with all the hardware needed to do the job."
2609,3,"The RollBak G2 is a great product, I really like it.  On my F-150 with an OEM Ford bed liner it did not fit however, as the corners of the bed liner are rounded and prevents the BAK from fitting correctly.  The opnly fit is to cut away some of the bed liner, or not use an OEM Ford liner with it.  I chose to get rid of the Ford liner as it seemed to collect a lot of dirt under it anyway.<br />Update November 2013:  I have had this installed for over 18 months now and am providing an update.  The cover no longer slides well into the case, it will stick both sliding in and out.  I have lubricated the rails, adjusted and rails, cleaned the whole thing, but after a week it will be sticking again.  Also it is not water proof, it leaks primary from the edges closest to the rear, but does leak all the way along.  I use it to protect my tools very often, and have had water on my tool boxes many times.  The rubber seal on the edge has started to peel away, it is held on by adhesive of some sort.  This was easy enough to repair, but annoying.  Probably would not buy again."
2610,4,Wraps around headrest. Easy to use waste container. Easy to remove debris also with velcro bottom. The thing I like most about it is that it's not too big so it doesn't stand out that much.
2611,1,"one side of the pair fit ok then the other side I couldn't even slip it in, it wasn't made correctly so I couldn't even use them. I guess you get what you pay for..."
2612,4,"This hitch was of very good quality, and easy to install for just about any back yard mechanic. Only took about 2 hrs and just a few tools of which I already had. The price however was the best part of the package, at about 2/3 the price of every where else I Checked."
2613,5,This is great stuff. You can pretty much use it anywhere. I tested it on a few pocket knifes that were difficult to open and they are smooth as butter now. I also tried it on a sticky Rubik's cube as others mentioned and it turns easily now.
2614,5,"Fast shipper, product was exactly what my daughters car needed. Her headlights were so bad. I was worried for her saftey! These are bright and clear! Thank you!"
2615,4,"Works as advertised, unfortunately illegal in Florida.  I suggest checking your State's laws before buying. Just got a non-moving violation referring to Florida Statute 320.061 which states:<br /><br />320.061: Unlawful to alter motor vehicle registration certificates, license plates, mobile home stickers, or validation stickers or to obscure license plates; penalty.--No person shall alter the original appearance of any registration license plate, mobile home sticker, validation sticker, or vehicle registration certificate issued for and assigned to any motor vehicle or mobile home, whether by mutilation, alteration, defacement, or change of color or in any other manner.

2616,3,"Well, It plugged up the hole, but I'm still not sure what the appliques sent in the package were for.  After mixing, the admixture solidified so fast, it was hard to work with.  The hole is plugged, it's not pretty, but at least water won't get into the lens compartment and cause a short.  I wish the instructions were a little more explicit and if the admixture solidification could be slowed a little bit giving the user more time to work with it, it would be a great product.  Although it was a relatively warm day when I set out on my project, I'll probably try it again in July when the weather is really hot to see if that has any effect."
2617,4,"I ordered this for my hubby and it fit Perfect! He is about 5' 11\\"" and he wears a size 40 jeans which gives him a little wiggle room. This fit perfectly over jeans and a sweater. It also kept him warm and dry during our snow tubing including wait time!  Only reason I did not give 5 stars  is because it took us three (3) deliveries to get this. The first one sent was marked XXL on the tag outside but the tag inside side M. The other delivery took longer than expected so we ended up having the third and final one shipped directly to hotel. I must say Amazon staff was extremely helpful and prompt in rectifying our issue."
2618,5,"This is my second set of EGR vent visors so I am familiar with the great quality of their product.  Being able to leave your windows down slightly when parked or riding without rain getting in is the best.  This model is being used on my 2008 GMC Canyon Crew Cab pickup truck.  I had tried a set by the other major brand prior to these and they were so thin that after a couple years they became brittle and cracked.  These are definitely heavy-duty compared to those.  The design of the EGR enables you to have your front windows even more open without fear of rain getting in which is a definite plus.  I also like that there is no tape on the front set.  They just snap in.  The set for the rear windows has the tape, so leave the windows up overnight after installing.  Great product!"
2619,3,"I got this to heat a Toro snow blower. On trying it, I found the entire crankcase is aluminum. The magnetic hold is useless. Further the only flat space on it was still really too small to put the whole face of the heater against. I did wedge the heater so about 2/3 of it was in contact but this only transfers a limited amount of heat. I measured the power and on average it was running at 50W due to the thermal cycling limit. It did warm the engine slightly but a 500W shop lamp next to the engine does a better job.<br />This may still work on my old Wisconsin motor on a tractor, that is magnetic."
2620,5,"RAYBESTOS braking components are (IMO) the best quality aftermarket parts out there.<br /><br />I am a retired auto tech and RAYBESTOS was the only aftermarket system I would use (other than specialized OEM).<br /><br />They offer differing quality products, so be careful when choosing (PROFESSIONAL GRADE)."
2621,5,"Made a lap top lid cover from contact paper and put this Betty Boop decal in the center. Turned out really cute. Beats the overpriced covers on the internet. Make your own. Amazon has different decals to use, they are sold in crafts and auto decals."
2622,5,"Used on 1997 Jaguar XJ6 when engine light came on.  The AutoLink AL309 was very easy to plug in, and it identified the general OBII Code in large BOLD letters \\""P1313,\\"" and provided an explanation \\""Cylinder #5 Misfiring\\"" specific to Jaguars (I believe it has most makes and model codes embedded in the machine). I then looked up the code number from a list of codes on Jaguar using Google. I learned there were six possible reasons for the misfire.  I then looked up replacement parts for the various potential problems, which gave me an idea of costs associated with each problem, and whether it was something I could fix on my own.  For the money, this is a very good value and I recommend the AutoLink AL309 to anyone who wants to know what a mechanic will know before the bill comes."
2623,5,"I never imagined they even still made these things. It was slightly different than the 40 year old one I took out, but it looks beautiful and works great."
2624,5,"So delish of a smell - makes me calm and happy while driving - smells like the real thing, lovely jasmine. I think I will order more to hang in my house!"
2625,3,"Looks sturdy and feels sturdy except for the handle its a little loose and feels like it might brake off also i dont know if its wide enough to fully compress the piston on a single or double caliper but i guess i will have to wait till i get to use it, i will update my review when it comes to that though i really hope it works well because i don't want to own three of them i bought it for the convenience that it claims to be able to do single, double, and quad calipers the seller though etool direct is an excellent seller fast shipping and great prices."
2626,4,"Got this for my 2012 Ford F-150 FX4. While Amazon didn't list the 2012 as being supported with this product, AMP Research's web site did so I ordered it with confidence. It shipped and arrived very quickly. It had good packaging protecting all the contents. Not that it matters because each part is incredibly solid and appears to be well engineered and manufactured. Directions were well written and I followed them with ease. Installation took about 10 minutes. The only downside was that they recommended a torque wrench, which I don't own and I wasn't going to plunk-down $90 for. So I had to guestimate how tightly to secure the bolts.<br /><br />The area on the step used to lower it is a tad too narrow. You wind-up running your boot along the bumper hoping to catch the step. AMP Research could extend it out another .5\\"" and make it much easier to get your boot on without making it stick-out too far on the side. Also, the material used to design the step is somewhat slick. It's not a non-skid rubber surface, its a hard composite. It's fine most of the time, but in cold wet weather I could see this getting slippery. However, I liked it better than the other fold-down step I found on Amazon. That one had plastic caps on each side of the step. I could see those quickly breaking-off after grinding my boot on it a few times, so I went with the Bedstep.<br /><br />Hinge works very well.  Spring keeps the step up under the bumper when you're driving around and makes it easy to retract.<br /><br />Step is rated at 300 lbs. I weigh 260 lbs. When I step on it, I see some flex in the step & arm (flexes down to the left) but it holds me and I can easily use it. Time will tell if it holds-up to that kind of strain over the long haul."
2627,5,product as described. was a fairly straight forward job for anyone who can work on cars. gasket kit came unbent which is a big plus.
2628,3,i have not bought these yet. but i was told i needed too. i have the bulbs they blink but do not stay on wen i turn them on. will this product help my problem?
2629,3,"It was listed on Amazon as fitting a 2010 Dogde 1500 Ram truck.  The connections on the new horn are not set up the way the connections on the truck are.  I finally made it fit, by breaking off all the plastic around the two connections on the horn so the truck end would slide on,. Not the best fix, but it works. Disappointed when they say its to fit this model and then its not the same connections as on the truck end."
2630,3,"This is a great product IF they were able to strengthen the arm of the mount. It is too thin and allows for a lot of vibration and that vibration is going to snap the tack welds on the plate portion causing you to eventually loose your plate along the highway. I was able to counter this by adding a bead of weld to the plate and arm and making a small bracket to go onto the opposite side of the shock and with a spacer and some nits and bolts made this a perfect piece. For the price its not bad if you have some scrap 1 inch steel laying around and the ability to engineer a bracket, otherwise look elsewhere cause the headache of loosing a license plate on a ride isn't worth it."
2631,4,This does do a great job keeping the elements off of the winch.  Easy to put on & off; can not be used during winch operation. Good fit.
2632,5,My dad was looking for a points file for the longest time and nobody has them anymore in any of the parts stores we went to.  Got on Amazon and order the 2-pack and it was exactly what he wanted.  They have worked great since receiving them too!
2633,5,This battery has power to spare. Works very well and lasts a long time great for the boater.  I would recommend to anyone needing a good battery on the water.
2634,5,It is nice to have cables that are long enough that you don't have to have both cars on top of each other to use them.  Decent quality.
2635,5,"Ok so I figured I would write a review since these seem to be new to amazon and they had prime shipping so I went for them.<br /><br />Firstly these are ATO fuses.  The description doesn't say it anywhere for some odd reason however they also sell a mini fuse set which is labeled correctly and the picture shows ATO fuses.  Anyways, the fuses came in a box that is actually pretty nice and latches properly shut.  Label says 1 year warranty although their fuses so shouldn't have a problem.  On the other side of the boxes label is a chart showing Tan = 5amp, Red = 10amp, Blue = 15amp, Yellow = 20amp, Clear = 25amp, Green = 30amp.<br /><br />The fuses themselves seem to be very nice quality and have the number on them printed clearly however it is the plastic color and not painted white.  Note that the link that connects the two ends is horse shoe shaped rather than zigzagged which is something I personally have never seen before.<br /><br />At ~$10 it was a great price for 120 fuses + an actual working container."
2636,1,"IT'S NOT A PROPER FIT ITEM FOR 2011 TOYOTA COROLLA \\""S\\"". THERE IS A BIG SPACE ON RIGHT SIDE. IT'S CUT AND CURVED FOR TRUNK BUT DOES NOT COVER WHOLE TRUNK."
2637,4,It was a great buy because:<br />chairs really are not heavy so can be easily moved<br />on top of this free shipping<br />it was packed in a lot of styrophome so nothing can get smashed<br /><br />one negative was some paint barley noticable came off my chair when I unpacked it but the styrophome showed no sign of pressure applied anywhere to cause the small scratch so I'm perplexed oh well I still love my bar stools
2638,1,"Would have given this 3 stars because of the odd shadows the lens has when driving (yes I had them properly alligned),but I gave them  one star because the plastic screw mounts broke after two days.  The lights fit very well just like OEM and look nice but if they fall out while your driving does that really matter?   Luckily I caught it in time before this happened and gobbed construction adhesive on the mounts to hold the lights in place.  The plastic is not flexible and very brittle ...NOT GOOD!"
2639,5,"i got fed up of the stick type gauges, they were hard to use and a bit difficuly to read,  so i purchased this.  works really well; the screen is bright and the numbers are big, the programmable feature is nice but i dont use it because i have many vehicles with various size tyres to keep track of. the beep it makes after taking the reading is audible and the display stays on long enough.   one downside is that the light at the tip isnt bright enough to be usable, and the tip doesnt seal properly on the cheaper type of rubbery valve stems.  but great product none the less!"
2640,5,The multimeter has all you need and then some.  Professional grade and all settings wanted for 12v testing.  I especially like the auto range function which takes the guess work out of some testings.
2641,5,"I liked the look of this hitch compared to the square tubing type. I also like that the round cross piece is welded closed where it joins the brackets. that makes it impossible to get water or mud or salt into the hitch. I beleive this design will last longer, without rusting out. This hitch was very easy to mount.The hardest parts are getting your bumper bolts loosened up to remove (18\\"" breaker bar did great), and drilling two half inch holes in the frame. It took me about 45 minutes total. The hitch looks great too."
2642,5,This item is sturdy and simple to use. It successfully scans my wife's 2003 Volkswagen Beetle (1.9 TDI) and my 2003 Jeep Wrangler (4.0 Sport).
2643,2,"Fast shipping, constructed well but absolutely no way to mount it without serious modifications since the mounts are welded in the middle of the tank instead of on the back side and thats the reason for the low rating."
2644,5,"This is exactly what I was looking for --  the Velcro fasteners for the roll bar are HEAVY DUTY, the LEDs are very bright, and it is battery powered.  Perfect for the dome light in my CJ7.  -- Tony"
2645,5,"I had a charger just like this one that lasted 6 years. I recharge trolling motor battery,car,truck& most of all RV. The RV has 2 battery`s that run lights, refegrator, tv , etc. that run while the genorater is not on & I`m out fishing. This charger is fast & doesn`t mess up my inverters while charging or at end of charge. I couldn`t find a 40amp charger when old one went bad so I bought a 25amp different brand. It charges good but makes inverters go crazy at end of charge so not good. So happy amazon now carrys this charger . Great Product."
2646,5,"Great product and very good value. The Bedrug fit perfectly into my Tacoma. I've only had it for a month, but it seems durable and well made. The dogs are happy with it, too."
2647,5,"Amazon has the best price, much less than Jegs or Summit!  This worked perfectly, now my fans are working great!"
2648,5,"I bagged a doe that weighed about 120lbs.  I had to haul it through a woods with fallen trees in the dark, and this worked very well! I had to pull over trees and it did so with ease.  The setup of this was easy and took no time at all.  I was VERY impressed with the wheels, they are sturdy and made with solid rubber."
2649,5,"The product was as described and fit my car seats fine (Nissan Frontier). Not the nicest material, but still comfy and look nice. I love Batman, so these seat covers are perfect for my truck! Love them. I would definitely buy them again."
2650,4,"I purchased a travel trailer in June of 2011 and took it out on a couple of camping trips before I had purchased these level units.  Needless to say, it was a guessing game on trying to get the trailer level from front to back and side to side.<br /><br />I found these graduted levels online and decided to try them.  I leveled my trailer with a carpenter's level and attached the levels on the front corner of the trailer.<br /><br />On the next camping trip it was a breeze to level the trailer because the graduated levels used together let you determine how much leveling you need to compensate for in inches.<br /><br />With this capability it was easy to get the right amount of leveling blocks in the right position the first time!<br /><br />I am very pleased with these graduated levels and feel that for the price they can't be beat.  They work as well as any of the other more expensive leveling systems that I saw online."
2651,5,"Emblem looks famtastic. Gives the vehicle a whole new character.  As if it were actually alive.  You can't help but walk slowly past the vehicle with fantastical thoughts and images of \\""what if...?\\""  Got an autobot set for my girlfriend.  The battle for Cybertron continues!"
2652,4,"First, let me start off by saying this would be 5-star if it weren't for the fact that the Canadian version is much larger. But, this is a great product. There are other hood deflectors out there that don't have the kia cut-out area, which I really didn't like. This goes on really easily with 3M tape and adheres directly to the hood. I would prefer something that doesn't stick directly to the hood, but then again, this is very nice and flush at the same time....always pros and cons. It is very easy to center up. I used the bottom where there is a slight lip in the hood and I made sure the bottom of those lipped, curved areas was lined up. This gives a good way to check vertically and horizontally.   As far as appearances go, this looks incredible. I have the Denim Blue Kia Soul and is gorgeous on there. I plan to add some \\""vinyl flavor\\"" to the bug hood deflector, which I would not have done to the hood itself."
2653,2,"These Shocks are narrower and shorter than the stock shocks on my dodge ram. I am probably going to have to change them to larger ones because they are pretty much fully extended when in a stagnant position. They also took longer than most things do from amazon, I think it was about 3 weeks. I was very disappointed all around. I cant say how they ride yet because i wanted them for when it is loaded down. I purchased bilstein for the fronts, because I use a plow, I wish I had done the same for the rear."
2654,5,This was purchased as a replacement for the original that fell off my Harley. It was an exact match for the remaining peg.
2655,3,The forward drive and passenger side shades are great and have not given any issues. The ones for the rear windows would stick out enough that the windows wouldn't roll all the way up. I ended up taking the back ones out.
2656,4,"I purchased mine for an '09 Tacoma, and it works as advertised, but I definitely recommend getting the load divider bar option to keep things from moving laterally in your truck bed. It appears to be fairly well built, but it is showing rust after only a couple of months. The rust is not affecting the functionality, and I think all the decent load retainers are made of steel, so they will all likely rust if left exposed to the elements. All in all, a great addition to anyone who actually uses the bed of their truck."
2657,5,"Installed the sensor in my 99 Saturn a week ago, the check engine light has not come on since. It was simple to install and the wire was the exact length and fit.    Shipping and packaging were also good.Amazon is a good place to shop."
2658,1,"looks decent , but the lighting is very dim and cheap. oh yeah, the so called brand new \\""sending unit\\"" doesnt work so the product is a failure. i have heard recent complaints about sunpros gauges. all negative. do not buy."
2659,2,Opted against this item because it is not stackable.  It is otherwise a good item if you only need to store 1 or 2.  Best feature is the two handles.
2660,5,"I bought this light because it was half the price as the others. I wasn't expecting to much. But to my surprise this light is very nice. It isn't real yellow or blue it is somewhere in the middle, if that can happen.  I have used them in rain and snow and this light worked very well in both.   I drive alot on freeway and back roads, this bulb is my favorite I've used so far.   Thanks Amazon and Hella"
2661,5,"It is heavy duty and works great. It is larger than most glove boxes. I keep mine in the behind the seat mesh pocket. Don't waste your time with cheap little gauges. This is the last tire gauge you will ever need to buy. Mine says \\""Made in the USA\\"". You can't get much better than that."
2662,5,"Actually purchased 4 of these items.  I live in a small apartment with an even smaller storage/laundry room.  So, vertical storage is a must.  However, the largest wall in this space contains a pocket door, so nails are not an option for shelving.  So I began to research outside the norm laundry storage solutions, and I came across this item.    The 4 are now hanging on the wall, 1 over 1 in 2 columns.  I added bright, foam stickies designating whites, colors, etc.  Easy breezy sorting.  My husband complimented my idea and everyone 'pitches' their items in the correct station.  Laundry made easy!"
2663,5,"When my son's alternator went out, I couldn't find it in stock locally. It would have to be ordered, it wouldn't be in for several days, and they weren't sure that their part would work.  The parts stores were also selling reconditioned alternators for a higher price than the new Bosch alternator.  I'm very impressed with the quality of the alternator I bought.  With Amazon Prime, I received it in a few days. I would definitely buy from them again."
2664,5,"I bought three of these off eBay for my riding lawnmower last year. I generally wear out 3-4 belts every summer. I've tried belts from maybe 8-9 different manufacturers before finding these Goodyear belts. I don't think I'll buy another brand of belt again. I installed the first belt and have been mowing with it weekly for nearly six months. It is showing some signs of wear, but the longevity compared to other brands I've tried is simply astounding. I just bought three more through Amazon and I suspect I'll replace my mower before I burn through these belts. Money very well spent."
2665,5,"The dolly worked very well especially in some very hard to reach spaces where holding a regular dolly was not possible, a nice extension of your hand into long reaches or narrow spaces."
2666,5,I love this litte tool! There is nothing about it that I don't like and the price makes it a real bargain.  don
2667,5,There are the same as the dealer at half the price.  I have a 2010 Grand Caravan with factory-installed dual DVD system.  Worked perfectly as soon as they were turned on.  Very pleased with these.
2668,5,"Alpinestars has done a grt job with these gloves. Fits to size, good protection , nice ventilation and ofcourse the color matches with my green kawi!"
2669,5,Product fit and worked as advertised. Mann filters reputation is excellent. Amazons delivery of the order arrived before their ETA which is a hughe plus.
2670,3,"I brought a Magnaflow direct fit catalytic converter for a 1993 miata LE; at a very good price.  But, it did not directly fit the space it should have to be called a direct fit product. I checked the number three time and had the unit listed to fit the car.  In fact I had to take it to a muffler shop and pay to have it cut shorter and welded in place.  The cat works fine and I'm no longer a gross polluter in the state of California now.  Apparently it's not just a problem with Magnaflow many of the after market direct fit cats do not fit the cars they claim they will, according to the very experienced muffler shop I used.  -Tom B."
2671,4,"Our 2008 Caravan had a strange odor with the use of it's A/C . The dealer suggested we had neglected to replace the \\""cabin\\"" filter . Which we had since we had no idea it had such a thing . So being the DIY kind of guy I am I began searching for filters . These are not commonly found at your local Wal Mart or even you local auto parts shop although the latter can gladly order you one , at a premium ! So off to trusty AMAZON I came and ta-da ! Here were multiple options to select from and having used FRAM filters for years I chose this one . It is an absolute perfect fit and when held side by side to the one that came out of the dash it's clearly more robust and better built and manufactured than the OEM filter . This was an easy job to do and took about 10 minutes start to finish but sure enough solved our foul smelling A/C . This product is likely to last a good while longer than the stock unit and with it's clearly superior build and material quality i'm confident that it won't prove to be an issue . 4+ months of use thus far and no issues or odd odors attest to this . So buy with confidence !"
2672,2,"Bought this filter for my 2007 Ford Taurus.  The filter itself seems to be well built, but its shipped with the wrong retaining clips.  This causes a nightmare situation.    I 2-starred this becaus its not really amazons fault, but its Wix's.  On their website it says this is the filter for my car.  Wrong!    Read online and you will see there are issues with these filters and wrong clips."
2673,1,The instructions that came with the remote did not work with my Monte Carlo LS. When I searched for other programming instructions the remote didn't work either. It was a waist of money.
2674,5,"Item received timely, works well, just slip it in place and insert the holding pin.  Well worth the money and convenience of shopping online!!!"
2675,1,"This pump was original equipment in my 2004 Lazy Daze motorhome. I have gone through a succession of them. None has lasted more than a couple of years, and that is with infrequent use. First I thought some water must have been left in the pump which froze and damaged the pump, though I followed Lazy Daze procedure for winterizing the RV. I began to remove the pump completely and store it inside my home for the Winter. Still, more pumps quit, leaving me in need of replacements on the road. The last(4th)pump was supposed to use a more mechanical switch which would last  longer. Even though I did not use the RV at all in 2010, it started going out on a recent trip. It will just stop for a bit, then start pumping slowly and erratically. To Shurflo's credit, they have provided the replacements at no  expense, but the cost in frustration and inconvenience has been awful. There won't be a number 5 Smart Sensor 5.7  pump. Even free it would be no bargain. I am shopping for an alternative. Those giving this pump a good review may  change their minds later. The pump is fine when it's working, but they can, and all 4 have, failed with little warning."
2676,4,"The door handle arrived on time, the paint finish matched and the product fit. If you are looking for a door handle make sure you put the paint color code in when you search."
2677,5,"Couldn't be happier, did what it was supposed to. Fader is gliding ever so smoothly after a tiny drop. Unfortunately for them I probably will not need to reorder for the life of the mixer."
2678,5,"I have had product for about a month now.  Product works fine, fairly low noise level. I use on low speed the majority of the time. It runs off a solar charged battery and only uses one tenth of a volt reduction on the battery for the whole night. I think it is a good product compared to others for the money."
2679,5,"Been driving around for a year or more with a chip in the middle of my trucks windshield. Saw this stuff on Amazon and ordered it. The price was really reasonable and the shipment came almost overnight. Took about 30 minutes to study the direrctions ( I'm 77 years old),checked out components and began the project. It was really simple,took about an hour and the results even pleased my Bride of 54 years. Highly recommended."
2680,4,It's exactly what is states to be. It's an affordable boot that does the job. I stretched it over the inner portion of the rear axle to save time and cost involved with disassembling the outer CV joint. It's pliable enough to stretch and ended up working great. No complaints.
2681,5,"I needed a bag that I could use on my M109R for daily commutes to work and home, plus traveling.  On a work day I can put my workout clothes, shoes etc for my pre-work workout as well as what I need for work in the larger bag.  I have not used the roll bag yet but it certainly will be good for small items to carry along or as an extra bag for the wife when traveling on the 9.  She could use it for makeup.  Good solid construction.  The larger bag is very easy to mount to my back rest and I then run the two straps around the saddle bag mounts.  Takes maybe 30 seconds.  I'd buy it again, very pleased."
2682,5,"The keyless remote is exactly like described in the description. You could see that it was obviously used, but it does not stop the remote from functioning properly. With the easy instructions, you'll have your remote contol for your car ready in no time!!! Good deal."
2683,1,"I received this stool as a gift Dec-09. After 1.5 years one of the legs broke and I sent an email to Lars at walkstool in sweden.<br />He claims it was from abuse. Said I leaned over and put too much stress on one leg. I did not do that.<br /><br />Conclusion, save your money and buy a cheaper stool you can have two of those in the time this one lasted.<br /><br />I have seen this described as indestructible, IT IS NOT.<br /><br />Just thought I would add the last thing that Lars Andersson, president (what he said in the email to me) said to me when I was trying to get this issue worked out:<br /><br />\\""P.S. I you think that Walkstool is not living up to even third party retailer, I suggest you throw it away and forget Walkstool for the rest of your life. Remember if a product brakes in any way, it has to be verified that it´s a quality issue, I e warranty issue. If not, there is normally no replacement.\\""<br /><br />Again, this stool is only for PERFECTLY even ground. Where do you find that while camping or disc golfing.  Buy the camp stool for 1/3 of the price and save your money!"
2684,4,"This stuff was quite chewy and left an aftertaste.  I prefer traditional polish sausage to polish strips.  Also, when you search google for luster lace I get partly clad skinny women for some reason.  Maybe they should eat more polish sausages."
2685,5,I bought a new soft top convertible and had no clue how to keep the top clean. I did lots of research and found this product. I like how the cleaner washes the top (remembering to use a soft brush along with it). After dried the top protector does awesome from keeping water off the top. Definitely an item to purchase to keep dirt and mold off the soft top.
2686,1,Poor quality product amounting to basic stickers affixed to a very basic chrome license plate frame...I returned the item as it was not worth the money
2687,5,"At first I was apprehensive about the capabilities of these tools. These tools saved me from spending money to have the work done and it took less time than expected to do a complete brake line replacement (front and rear). Good tools to have, easy to work with."
2688,4,"I've been using advanced headlight bulbs in all my vehicles for at least 10 years now, and have found them to be invaluable because I live in a fairly rural area.  The only drawback with the \\""super white\\"" style of bulb is longevity; they have none.  I consider myself lucky to get a year out of them.  Invariably, one will blow out within 12 months (it's the same no matter who makes the bulbs too, be it Hella, Sylvania, PIAA, Phillips, etc).  Because of their high price, and the fact I have 3 vehicles, it has now become cost prohibitive to continue buying them.    This style of bulb is a bit different.  While they are enhanced, they aren't in the \\""super white\\"" class.  As such, they last far longer, and they're less expensive to boot.  They don't have the beautiful color or light output the other style of bulbs have, which is a fairly significant drawback, but they are most certainly better then stock bulbs.    I do, however, debate Phillips claim of \\""80% more light\\"".  I don't get anywhere near that -- maybe 50%, and even that's probably generous -- but they do cast a stronger light that displaces further then standard bulbs.  I do feel they're worth the money."
2689,4,"I've always been a fan of valet keychains, they let you keep everything together on one chain so fears of losing \\""the other set\\"" is not a constant worry. However, in this day with all the bulky security keys and remotes, you are forced to have multiple sets. You can quickly attach this to your house keys and clip on your truck key on the logo side with a quick tug, which pretty much eliminates the need for the valet separation. That's why I docked it one star. If you have room in your pockets this is worth having, other wise it's just more bulk."
2690,4,"the color is a little dull once you get the sticker compared to the neon green represented in the photo of it. but its still pretty legit, looks good on my car still, just not neon, more of a lime green with lowered contrast and brightness. but overall still good"
2691,5,"I was concerned aftermarket mats might not fit my 2011 Toyota and interfere with vehicle controls. Not a problem, Weathertech mats fit perfect,in fact better than factory mats. Color is a perfect match with my grey carpeting. Combine that with resonable price and free shipping from Amazon, you can't go wrong."
2692,5,"I purchased this this power supply for camping.  Used it this weekend to power 3 different 110V air mattress pumps.  Each use it inflated a double height queen mattress.  The rest of the weekend it powered a radio, and charged cell phones.  In the evenings the light was handy so no one tripped over the unit.  I didn't jump any cars, or inflate any tires, so I cant comment on that.  The built in charger/tender lets the unit sit on a self plugged in all day, with no worries of over or under charging."
2693,5,Installed this in my wife's 2007 Mazda 6 and works perfectly. Great addition to the car
2694,4,a standard rear view mirror.   fits the old standard mount on the windshield with no problem.   the only down side is that the tightening screw is star shaped.  who use a star shaped screw anymore?
2695,5,"Heard some negative reviews about the chuck being difficult to seat properly without leaking. I had no problem at all on all my auto tires, both products. My bicycle tire, I had to hold it in place. I bought the Accu-Gage EZ air check and inflate tires, and the Campbell Hausfeld MP6000 Tire Inflator with Gauge. I connected the Campbell to the air input of the Accu-Gage, it stayed in place, absolutely no leaks on either connection (AG-to-tire valve and CH-to-AG), so with my right hand on the CH air trigger, my left hand was free! I did notice that the CH gauge consistently showed 1-2 psi higher than the AG, and by trusting all the other reviews, I would say the AG is the correct one, but the CH wasn't off by much.  Now that I know the CH is fine but 1-2 psi off consistently, I can keep that home, and keep the AG in the car so when I go to Costco to fill with nitrogen, I can use it without too much difficulty."
2696,2,"I think it work the same as regular windex. I had try on closet mirror and car windshield, it not work well for me."
2697,4,"these are very nice looking and high quality but be prepared to do some re-wiring...all the plugs have to be cut off and re-wired because RECON can't spend a few dollars more and make plugs that fit the LED version. they use the same wiring harness from the non LED lights that doesn't fit! for the price they should be \\""plug and play\\"" not \\""snip and twist\\"". a little time consuming but worth it!"
2698,5,Great Value
2699,5,"A couple of these and some five-gallon buckets and you can start your own car wash.    Why use the \\""two-bucket\\"" method? Simply-put, the grit-guard keeps you from grinding dirty into the finish of your car.     This is a must-have for car enthusiasts."
2700,3,"Our car tends to get a messy interior. At least one reason is the center gear box with its complex detail. Another reason is that I tend to go with exterior-only car washes. So I was really looking forward to this product.<br /><br />If it could keep that gearbox dust and crumb-free, that would be great and save me some guilt.<br /><br />It only did an OK job. Yes, the car is less messy, but no, it's not completely clean. Nowhere near.<br /><br />And splat itself feels, I think, unpleasant. t's cold, and a little bit slimy. I couldn't break off any, so had to use the whole jar for one clean-up. I know it says it's reusable, but unless I can fold it on itself, I don't really see how I'll be able to use it again.<br /><br />All in all, I didn't think it was worth the trouble, so it's back to the car wash for me."
2701,5,"Here are some YouTube videos of me using Foamtek to clean paint, wheels and windows.  It simply works!  It doesn't scratch and leaves behind protection.    I have other waterless washes but this one is my favorite!    [...]  [...]  [...]  [...]"
2702,3,"These sunglasses do fit over my prescription lenses, but they're very large and heavy.  The foam lining the inside is a light, squishy polyfoam like you might see made into covers for the ear pieces on head sets.  Not terribly durable, but it really doesn't have to be.<br /><br />My glasses do fit inside the sunglasses, but the sunglasses push my prescription glasses into my face, making wearing these pretty uncomfortable.  I'll need to give them a bit more wear time before I decide whether I like these."
2703,5,This lei is so cute on my car mirror & it smells nice & clean.  I want more to give as gifts!
2704,5,"I bought this air filter for my Subaru and it is constructed very well with a rigid metal frame. The filter it replaced was another major brand but was not constructed nearly as well and used glue instead of metal for reinforcement. The pleats on that filter were also damaged after about 25,000 miles. Most manufacturers today recommend a 25-30k mile change interval, this is sufficient even though it contrasts what the filter companies and quick lubes will tell you (every 12-15k miles) follow the manufacturer's recommendation they know the vehicle best.     I have learned over the years that Fram filters are a step above most others and well worth the extra money. Amazon sold my filter at time of purchase for far less than area parts houses. You will not be dissapointed with this air filter."
2705,5,"I originally had an Extang roll-up tonneau cover.  It did the job keeping what I had in the bed of my truck out of sight and out of the elements, but was a pain in the butt snapping and un-snapping it.  It was damn near impossible to fasten it back during cold months due to shrinkage.  I was looking into a roll top but didn't want to spend around $1K on a tonneau.  The tri-folds caught my eye and I looked at a couple of makes and the reviews for them and decided on the Extang.  I have been very pleased.  Firstly, it literally took longer for me to get it out of the box than it took to install on my truck.  The Extang website has video instructions as well as a post on Youtube.  This tonneau is very well constructed and performs great.  I wish I knew about trifolds before I bought my old roll-up version.  This thing makes it very easy to use the bed of my truck.  My next door neighbor liked mine so much he ordered one for himself and since I had previous installation experience, the installation took under 4 minutes (his wife timed us).  I highly recommend the Extang Tri-fold."
2706,5,"These worked great on my 08 G8 GT. After trying to find a retailer locally and having no luck, I found these. The 26 inch and 15 inch pair did the trick perfectly."
2707,1,"The concept and packaging of this device is appealing. Unfortunately, after a minimal period of use, the wires broke off from the solar cell housing. (Easy to resolder, but I don't want to risk starting a fire in the car). Furthermore, the instructions tell you to always unplug the unit while the car is running, which is an annoyance and, I believe, hints at cheapo engineering. Avoid."
2708,4,"The kettle is not actually copper, which didn't surprise me.  But the finish on the kettle is good looking, and if it holds up, is probably better than actual copper anyway.  The frame is black.  There is just enough lava rocks to cover the burner.  Overall, it looks very nice, much better than other propane firepits in this price range that I found a local stores.  The flame output is good looking and very warm.  However, neither the frame or the kettle get too warm to the the touch.  It's only drawback is due to the propane itself:  the flow of gas makes noise.  There is probably no way to avoid it if you want the convenience of propane.  Some of the sound occurs at the tank (the included hose is about 6-feet long) and some occurs at the valve on the firepit.  It's not loud, just noticeable.  But frankly, I got used to it.  It is worth it to have the propane to avoid the hassle of logs, firestarting, ash, soot, smoke, etc. on your patio.  Update 11-23-2011:  FYI, my review was for a slightly different version that is now selling; mine is not the 'matchless' version that Amazon now shows.  Anyway, after a season of use, the faux copper bowl shows surface rust.  I did not use the cover, so it was exposed to the weather.  Despite not using the cover, it is a bit disappointing."
2709,5,100% satisfied with the seller and the item. Don't let the cheaper price fool you. I shopped around and this was the best price I could find and the item is exactly as described and fits perfectly. Thank You!!!
2710,5,"My 2010 Honda Ridgeline is one of several Honda vehicles that has a very accessible cabin air filter. (On my vehicle the glove compartment unhinges and drops down, the old filter slides out, and the new one slides in.) This air filter fits like the OEM filter installed at the factory. In 10 minutes, I had cleared out the large leaves and smaller particulates sucked up by the old filter in my first 17,000 miles, installed the new TYC filter, and buttoned everything up again. The difference in air flow was quite noticeable.<br /><br />Something else I noticed was that my wallet was still full. The price of the filter from Amazon.com was approximately 10 percent of what my local Honda dealer would charge to install one at the shop. I could buy a lifetime supply of this item for the cost of one dealer change!"
2711,5,I received the jacket pretty quick and it is great. Inner liner is easy to take off. I recommend this jacket.
2712,1,I have the Big Easy and inflatable wedge.  That's all that arrived so far.    Rollin Morgan
2713,5,"[[ASIN:B002INP6QU Powerbuilt 640819 Mechanical Scissor Jack]] I ordered this for our daughter's first car, that didn't have a jack in the trunk. It looked fine to me and when we received it, it was just that. It filled our needs just fine...  Bruce Farrell"
2714,5,"Excellent product, plug it and leave it... it's automatic.  Small but powerful, so far the best I've ever used."
2715,4,"I own a Ford Ranger and when gas prices started to inch up I decided to go out and get a locking gas cap.  I went down to my local Autozone and paid $16 buck for a Slant locking gas cap.  A little pricey but decided to go ahead. The gas cap works, but takes 2 hands, and a prayer get off. My wife cannot use it, and at times I wish I had never put it on. A few times it has taken over 5 minutes to get off.<br /><br />The problem I found, after much research, is that when you turn the key to the unlocked position and try and rotate off.....the key rotates with the gas cap and stays in the locked position. A real pain when reaching into the small recessed cubicle where the gas cap is located. So you need 2 hands. One hand holds the key in the unlocked position while the other grabs the base of the cap and twist until off she comes. You have to grab the base because your other hand is in the way holding the key.<br /><br />I ordered the Motorcraft locking gas cap,(yea expensive) and to my surprise, when you rotate the key into the unlocked position I hear a little click and the key stays in the unlocked position. Now again I have a gas cap that works easy and with one hand.  I am docking it a star because the price is way to high. Come on Ford it's just a gas cap!"
2716,5,"Very well made Lock, Hard and not so heavy and cheap, made of steel and hard plastic with a cover to the key hole, before you buy it make sure it will fit your disc brake, the website doesn't show the mesures, so here they are:<br /><br />* Pin = 10mm (Diameter)<br />* Throat = 63mm(L)(-4mm of circular finish), 30mm(W), 10mm(H)(-1mm of finish border)<br /><br />If your disc break is more longer than 63mm from outside to the inside border, you can still use it if one of the holes in your disc is 10mm or less and the distant from the hole to the outside border is 63mm or less, if so consider the most important mesures for a perfect fit are 10mm(Diameter) of the hole and 10mm(W) of the disc brake.<br /><br />Comes with:<br /><br />* 3 keys and one with a red led flash light.<br />* Bright Orange reminder cable to hook over your handlebars to avoid to forget to unlock it.<br />* Carring pouch for the lock, you can fit it to your belt.<br /><br />Remember there is nothing that will protect 100% your vehicule, but this is a great way to prevent thief, make sure you use other secure mesures to make less easy to steal your bike."
2717,5,"Exactly what you can expect from an NGK product, high quality, great performing, and great looking piece.  Definately a satisfied customer."
2718,5,"Inherited a cream puff '97 Olds 88 from my mother-in-law (50K miles on the clock). Love the car but both headlights were badly frosted to the point that they hardly put any light on the road. Followed the directions on the kit and used the polishing buffer first. About half the surface area of each headlight cleaned right up but I could still see cloudiness on the remainder. I then used the #3 and #4 sanding pads (didn't think the coarser ones were necessary) and followed with another buffing.    The improvement is truly amazing and the headlights now put about three times as much light on the road as before. If you look closely at the lenses you can still see a pattern of very small cracks (crazing) that probably go all the way through the plastic, but no amount of buffing is going to fix that. I spent about hour doing both headlights and it was time well spent."
2719,5,"Tough to say what the serviceability of the shocks will be but so far so good. They came with easy to understand directions for installation and the job went smoothly without incident. The toughest part was deciding where to put the valve stem. Had way more than enough air line for the job which I was somewhat worried about on first look. More importantly, they are doing what I wanted them to do."
2720,3,cant say much about this it wouldnt fit my wrangler   but it was very easy to get a refund back from amazon very quick and easy
2721,5,"Big enough to be useful, unlike most products of this kind. No sticky residue, simply rinse with water to clean off dust and renew its super traction. Freakin amazing!"
2722,5,It took me about an hour to install. The tricky bit is threading the bolts through the frame but you get the hang of that quickly with the spring steel fish wires (included). Cutting the plastic under body trim was a snap with my table saw. All in all very straight forward on my 2009 Jetta TDI Wagon.
2723,5,"I have been using it for over a month now.  I have a Suzuki Boulevard C50 and it is a perfect fit.  It covers the front all the way down to the brake disc.  I don't have closed parking where I live so I have to rely on it.  After a two day rain storm, I lifted the covers to find not a drop of water under the cover.  At the price I paid for it, it is a great value.<br /><br />Updated Oct 2011:<br /><br />You can add durability to the list of positives. It has protected my bike from heavy Florida rains very effectively.<br />Another thing:  I try not to cover my bike as soon as I've brought it home. I was worried about the heat of the exhaust messing with the cover.  However, on one occasion, it was going to start raining very soon and so I decided to cover it within 10 minutes.  The material was able to handle the heat.  I have a 800cc bike and if you have something bigger that gets very very hot, then you probably shouldn't do that."
2724,1,this switch started my car on fire and i have the pictures to prove it. save yourself a huge problem and don't but this switch
2725,5,"great product, helpful to hold items in place, need instructions to install net vertically.  Much less complicated to install horizontally."
2726,5,I had no problem installing this in my 2005 Toyota Accord LE. It fit perfectly. I really can't comment on how well it actually filters the air other than to say I have no complaints.
2727,5,"This cushion fits into the seat of a Ford pickup well.  It does not slide or move with you when you get in or out of the vehicle, if you pay attention.  I have never had the heat switch on high, the low heat is great for my back.  With back problems, this makes my winter driving much more bearable."
2728,5,"This is a great product.  Well made and kinda gothy.  Unfortunately I have to send it back.  No matter what I did my steering wheel was just too big.  Would still recommend it to anyone that like skulls, and pink stuff. :D"
2729,4,the pipes are loud and need to be welded in place.  the clamps are useless because they slide out of place.  the product overall is what i expected.
2730,5,"Very good, only used once but was a life saver. My Harley wouldn't start and I wanted to go riding for the 'Toys for Tots' run.."
2731,4,"Great seats! We had terrible seats in our 92 Toyota Corolla, and these fit perfectly. They were also incredibly easy to put on,which is a plus."
2732,5,"I was initially skeptical about this bumper because the picture  on Amazon does not show the most current version and the price seemed way too low as compared with other outlets. I did some research on the Smittybilt website and made the decision to go ahead and purchase this bumper. I was immediately impressed by how rapid Amazon shipped the bumper and how quickly I received it , all without paying one dime for shipping. Once I opened the well packed box I was excited to see it does have light mounts and the weld lugs for clevis installation. It is exactly as the Smittybilt website shows. Installation was a breeze. I had it installed in less than 15 minutes and that even included removing my factory bumper. Wow! Great product and sharp look for the Jeep. Thank you Amazon and Smittybilt. It is refreshing to receive such excellent service."
2733,5,"I ordered these LED lights for my 2002 911 and they were packaged perfect and arrived within 2 days, not sure what all the fuss here is about. If you have a 1999-2001 Porsche 911 these will not give you any error codes- If you have a 2002-2004 you need to just buy an LED flasher RELAY, they are about $20 and you exchange it with the one in your car, just unplug yours and plug the LED relay in- thats it- the relay is near the clutch, turn your turn signal on, and you will hear it clicking on the left, reach up and touch the relays and you will actually feel the clicking, then you pull it out and install the LED FLASHER RELAY IN- it doesn't come with the lights so you need to order one, i got mine from a place called superbrightleds. com. part #CF13GL-02"
2734,5,Great price! Fast delivery! Easy to install once the front bumper was removed to access the screws. Fits perfectly and shines like a charm!  A positive review all around.
2735,4,Look awesome. Add a inch to each side. But I had to break off the inner chrome cover to clear the throttle. Went great with my red bars on black plastics and joker bar pad.
2736,5,The seller responded swiftly when I claimed that I hadn't received the stuff after when it's supposed to arrive. They replied me soon and resend the stuff without charging me.
2737,5,I have been using royal purple products since 1998. I have never had any problems with this oil. exceeds expectations.
2738,5,The product came on time and as promised. No problems. I would buy from this seller again.
2739,4,I enter my vintage Super Beetle in many different auto shows.  I needed a good plastic cleaner for my clear plastic protector on the hood/trunk and wheel base.  I saw this product at a recent show.  The guy owned a 2010 Camaro and introduced me to the product.  I bought it myself and it works perfectly.  I recommend to anyone that wants to protect plastic items.
2740,3,"So far I've only used this with a USB cable to charge my phone. Even that was only for a short time as the fan in this device is so noisy that in interferes with your enjoyment of the car ride. I wound up switching back to my old phone charger for daily use, and I'm saving the Wagan times when I specifically need the outlets. Hopefully, it won't let me down when we really put it to the test."
2741,5,"I was nervous because they are so damn cheap (Er, inexpensive), but the brand is good, and the tool is GREAT! I've been a mechanic for over 30yrs and have tried every brand and style of screwdriver around (still looking for more) and I can tell you, \\""You want one of these\\"". It isn't the end-all/be-all, but you NEED one of these."
2742,3,"These window well cover work well enough, but after about 2 years the plastic become very brittle, like super thin glass.  It's fortunate that every once in a while some vendor has them at a good price without a ridiculously high shipping fee."
2743,5,"I had a great experiense with this saler, the item was in perfect conditions and it was delivered as it was promised.  Thank you."
2744,2,"The cover is very small and did not fit my wheel.  As if that weren't bad enough- the grip looks EVEN from  a distant to be made of some cheap rubbery-plastic material.  The stitches are painfully obvious and it looks as if the  company that made them did not try at all to conceal them.  Hardly what I'd call elegant.    If you have a really small steering wheel and need a cover, I  really don't recommend this one."
2745,1,"I purchased a set of these in December 2009 to replace my ~7 year old HID's. They have been great until a few days ago, when one of them started turning pink (the telltale sign that the bulb is about to go out). The description claims they last 3 times longer than halogen bulbs. I don't know whether I got a defective bulb or what, but 8 months cannot be the mean time between failures for these. I cannot find warranty information anywhere, so I will contact Sylvania & Amazon for a fix, but as a cynical consumer, I am not optimistic. At any rate, not happy with this purchase.    update 8/9 -  Sylvania replied to my note and are shipping a replacement bulb. Great customer service so far."
2746,1,"Installed these bulbs,  they are no brighter than the original bulbs on my car, not as claimed in the ad.  I am disappointed with them."
2747,5,Best price and free shipping made this a great value.   Replaced original shocks on a 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Larado (4x4/V8).  Significant improvement in ride and handling.  Feels like new.
2748,4,Wires were bought to replace original set from a Toyota Corolla (ae101) with 4afe(1.6l) engine  Original Set lasted 12years and were in dire need of replacement as per manufacturer recommended service.  At first the wires seemed thinner than the original set but they are the same thickness. These wires are slightly longer though (yes the 4 wires have different lengths but the corresponding wires in the set are slightly longer than the factory one its replacing); and the clip that secures it to the distributor cap seems more flimsy than the original but it gets the job done perfectly.  Instructions are included and they are spot on.  A small pack of dielectric grease is included and the instructions tell you how to apply it.(it was a first time for me seeing a pack of grease with spark plug wires)  It has a SQUARE top; NOT a ROUND one as the picture would have you believe  Final word ...Good stock replacement wires
2749,5,"I mean, it's a light bulb... it flashes when I turn on the signal on my bike. It's bright. Makes turning a whole lot easier."
2750,5,"I purchased this unit to power an older 'Executive' cooler (no longer made) rated at 12V 5 amp. It powered up the first try and after running 12 hours it was barely warm, and the cooler was still working fine. It's lightweight and has a decently long cord. No disappointment here."
2751,5,"We recently got a quote from a dealer to install this hitch and was quoted $600 to purchase and install the hitch.  I did a little research and found that I could do it it myself in less than an hour. I ordered the hitch from Amazon at a great price.  The product was a perfect match for my 2008 Honda Odyssey. I installed it in my driveway in under an hour and didn't even need to detach the tail pipe as some sites suggest. Easiest $437 I have ever saved!  My one significant complaint is that the hitch was too heavy for the box in which it was shipped.  There was not enough padding or stabilizing packaging in the box (there was none when it arrived) so by the time it reached me, it had bounced around in the box so much it had ripped open the top and must have fallen out as the paint on the hitch was scraped through to the metal in a couple of places."
2752,5,"This improved my gas mileage drastically!    I can also feel my engine running cleaner, and it doesn't lag so much when I punch the pedal.    I also had a partially stuck lifter, which is an expensive and pain in the ass repair.  this freed it up and now I never get that clicking sound from my engine.    LOVE this.  Its like a cures-all for cars.  Of course it can't do everything for your engine, but this definitely does what it is supposed to.  It talks the talk and walks the walk!"
2753,4,I sent an inquiry to the seller with no reply.   This product is what I have been thinking but not sure if this will work for my Chrysler Sebring 2000.   Anyone has an opinion?
2754,5,"I drive a 2004 Jeep Liberty. These rotors are probably more than my car needs. But well worth the cost. The air slots work wonders and these rotors work great with EBC brakes too. Much better than the low cost, low quality original parts. Paid 125.- to have been put on by my mechanic."
2755,5,"best OEM replacement, I changed both oxygen sensors and couldn't be happier with the end result and performance of them"
2756,5,"I'm an electrical engineer and purchased this inverter to have additional backup capabilities, as I already have two marine batteries connected to a backup sump pump and wanted to run minimal equipment during power outages.  Power outages aren't common, but when it happens, we typically experience about an hour long duration.<br /><br />This is a decent quality, budget inverter.  I do agree with other reviewers regarding the power cable connection, but it's not bad as one can use the cable lug along with the thumb nut to tighten.  Some may see the need for hex nuts and use of a wrench, but this may actually be a hazard as posts are very close together (unless battery connection is made last).  Regarding the fan, it is thermostatically controlled.  It only comes on about when supplying over 500W continuous load.  During standby, it draws about 1 amp (12 Watts).  Testing the inverter in the garage in 40 degF temp, I could not get the fan to kick on even with 750W continuous load.<br /><br />Included remote switch is very convenient.  More than the actual remote, I use the hard wired switch that is connected to the inverter via supplied control cable.  It would have been better to include a GFCI receptacle; I have a plug in GFCI outlet for this added protection.  Soft start is very convenient and can start my DeLonghi 50-pint dehumidifier that draws 900 W continuous.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this inverter.  It's cheap, it would supply power to light loads within the inverter rating.  Just purchase #4 AWG minimum size cable.  I found purchasing a automotive jumper cable to be cheaper and installing lugs in lieu of purchasing stiff THHN type cable at home supply store.  I plan to use the left over of the jumper cable for connection to vehicle battery when I go camping."
2757,5,"Good abrasive media; fair price and you get more in this than you think.  Again, no complaints."
2758,5,Fast shipping. The BMW 5 series wiper refills work great and were easy to install. Remember to purchase two. I didn't read the info carefully and assumed they came in a pair and just ordered one. Had to order twice and pay another shipping fee. That was my mistake. The seller was excellent.
2759,4,Bought this as a replacement for one that I had for years. The other one was blown off when we had our No Name Hurricane here in NYC in March. I found the cover to be durable and well constructed for the price. If I had only tightened the cover a little bit more it wouldn't have blown off. It's a good buy.
2760,5,"After UPS finally made it upma my driveway because it was snowing on every delivery attemp.  I instaled the strobes about a week ago and now no snow.  Instilation wasn't too hard just took time to run the wires.  The strobes are very bright,easy to use and work great.  I do not have enough clearance for a roof light for plowing snow and get in my garage.  These lights are perfect.[[ASIN:B00158OO3U Street Glow SGPROSKIT Pro-Series Strobe Light Kit]]"
2761,5,"I lived with the tailgate on my Jeep Grand Cherokee dropping on my head for years whenever it gets cold out, until it dropped on my wife's head, knocked her down and hurt her hip when she hit the ground.     I got an ultimatum to have it fixed, but didn't want to pay the dealers $$$ to replace the support arms. I found the replacements on Amazon, read the reviews, found that it was not a difficult replace and invested the $40 to get the new supports. I should have bought a T-40 Torx bit from Amazon too, but got one at a local auto parts store for a couple bucks. It will help if you have a stick (or another person) available to force the tailgate fully open while you are replacing the supports, to get them aligned before inserting the screws.    What a difference. They went on really easily and although I can't recall how the tailgate opened and closed when new, the new supports actually allow the tailgate to almost pop open, and forces me to pull the tailgate down to get it to close. Now I need to be careful not to have the tailgate hit me on the chin when it comes open.....    While I was at it, I bought two Hood support arms and installed them too. Now I can get rid of that stick I have been carrying around for a couple years.    I can't believe I waited so long to replace the supports. For $60-70 and 30 minutes easy work, I fixed both problems that have been nagging me for years, and saved hundreds of dollars I would have had to pay a dealer."
2762,5,"This is a very good tester and let you know the Voltage and Amps in a battery and also can test it, great for the shop or to tect your vehicles battery output."
2763,5,Very nice vibrant decal. Has not faded one bit. Make sure you realized that this is a decal and not a sticker. Follow the enclosed instruction and all will be well.
2764,5,I purchased these because I didn't like the stock chrome looking bezels.  I bought these to darken the look with my dark blue Jeep.  They were easy to install using the stock holes.  Nice product.
2765,4,"The only drawback too this product is the size, if you want to stick it in the glove compartment. It's easy to use and very accurate. It locks on to the valve stem and you can bleed the pressure down very easily. The battery life is an unknown at this time,having only used it for 1 month. It is much better then any guage I have ever used."
2766,5,"The part came in the original Denso box with a tube of thread anti-lock cream.  My 2000 Subaru Impreza's check engine light came on and the OBD-II error code was a P1133, replace the air fuel mixture front oxygen sensor, Denso Part 234-9018.  Originally, Amazon claimed that the Denso 234-9018 was the wrong part.  But I checked other vendors and this was the correct part.    I had a bear of a time disconnecting the oxygen sensor from the wiring harness since the drive shaft is in the way coming from underneath the car.  Unscrewing the old oxygen sensor was easy with a 22mm box wrench.  The whole job took less than a 1/2 hour.  Started the car a couple of times and the check engine light turned off.    I made the mistake of ordering this part with a book I wanted - BIG MISTAKE!  Amazon waited to assemble the package 10 days before I got the part.  Needless to say, I would have gotten the part in 3-4 days if I had ordered the part by itself.  If you need an oxygen sensor, Amazon has the best price for this OEM part."
2767,2,"From the reviews on the web, I expected a quality pressure gauge. It seems to be of light weight, cheap construction. While it did work and I trusted the readings, after three weeks, it broke. Cost of repair is three dollars for return shipment from the manufacturer. I'm not sure I am willing to spend three dollars more on this gauge."
2768,4,This unit is great! I've used it several times on vehicles from 2000-present. It has saved me a few bucks along the way not counting the dollars I've help friends save simply by being able to reset codes or identifying a defective sending unit. I highly recommend it for the home mechanic types.
2769,5,"I am not a \\""car\\"" girl!  I went to Auto Zone and when I saw the price of a small pack of fuses I decided I would check out Amazon.  I am sooo glad that I did.  I received a ton of assorted fuses and the kit contains several testers and the tool needed to remove the fuse as well!!  This is a great deal!  I took out my kit to \\""brag\\"" a little and a mechanic told me that it was indeed a great deal!"
2770,4,Jury's still out on this one with me.  I ran it in 2 tanks over the course of a month.  Not sure I noticed any performance gain or mileage gain for that matter...but I did notice the smoke that came out of the tailpipe was not as heavy so it was doing something in there.  If you are looking for peace of mind that your diesel is being treated and is the best for your engine I would say its good. I just can't justify the cost right now.  Maybe it would show better results if I had some other engine upgrades.
2771,3,"Had these about a year. The deer by the sides of the road don't run away, as far as I can tell, when I come by at speeds fast enough to make these work. But I haven't had one standing right in front of me lately, either."
2772,5,I only use Purolator filters. Amazon has some of the best prices. I can't buy them locally at their price.
2773,5,"I ordered this item from America and was amazed to receive it in ten days. It was a direct replacement and needed no modification of any kind, it works well a gave a big saving over the UK sourced unit especially when over half the cost was delivery and still the saving was big.  The sellers were friendly and helpful and gave excellent communication and delivery advice.  Would definately contact this supplier again for Jeep parts.    No grumbling about this!"
2774,3,Very good kit for the money. The bottle of interior cleaner unfortantly broke open during shipping and caused a mess of the box. Amazon was cool with making things right but be warned the bottles arent meant to be shipped through the mail so good luck if you order! Good value and a decent product.
2775,4,I bought these for my sister since she has two little kids and they like bright colors. Good for kids' house keys as well.
2776,4,Kind of over the top. But they are an eye catcher if that's what you're looking for.
2777,4,"Purchased this seat because I was curious how it worked. On the first test, I was pleasantly surprised at how it cooled me off in a hot car. There could be a few design changes to make it work even better, but I think it's pretty cool. ( pun intended)"
2778,5,"We owned a Prius close to two years and this is the second time changed air filters, hopefully this is the last one.  So far driving without any problem for a month already.  Can not feel horse power increased obviously but worth if it really last > 100k miles."
2779,5,"I highly reccomend the Actron CP9180. I had a cheaper tool that only gave you the code and not what the code stood for. I have wasted so much time looking up what the code meant. With this tool it tells you the code and what the code stands for. It has many other diagnostic features that the cheap scanners do not.   This product is well worth the Amazon Price! It is a Nice Quality easy to use tool. I have used this on various foreign and domestic cars with OBD-II and it has always been compatable, and had the code definition in the tool."
2780,5,Simple change your regular air filter a few times a year or buy the K&N and never replace it and gain a little extra horse power to boot!
2781,1,I bought this product because it was reusable and removable. However they sent normal tint. They apologized and sent a replacement and it was again the same product and wrong item. I am extremely disappointed that Amazon is indeed falsely advertising Static Cling tint and sending normal tint twice!!!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.
2782,5,"This is a great amateur claybar kit.  Clay is not super aggressive so you have less of a chance of ruining clearcoat, and if you are claybarring and waxing regularly, it is all you'll need.  I've made my car look brand new again with this kit, the three stage mothers kit (pre wax cleaner, sealer and glaze, pure carnuba wax), and a coat of mothers reflections top coat.  This time around I'm adding in another coat of synwax after the pure carnuba wax and the top coat, and will see if its worth the extra step."
2783,1,"The Permatex repair worked for one year, then the adhesive lost conductivity. It took hours of troubleshooting to diagnose the problem. Fortunately, the previously repaired tab was still firmly attached, so I was able to wedge a piece of bare copper wire behind it to make it defrost. I'd recommend buying a product with higher silver content, such as Frost Fighter."
2784,5,"I've used Mother's products for years. I've been using the 3 step cleaner, sealer and glaze, and carnuba wax and you can really see the difference. I have a 2006 Acura RSX(last year they made them), Milano Red  and I can't tell how many compliments I get on it's appearance. Friends are always asking how I get it to look so good,and I've made quite a few converts. I also use their Leather cleaner/conditioner on the interior which works great and leaves the seats looking good. I've had occasion to contact Mother's customer service, and they were a pleasure to deal with. They really seem to understand how important it is to satisfy customers. You won't be disappointed with any of their products."
2785,5,"I used Mobil 1 10W-30 in my 1994 Ford F-150 six cylinder for 14 years.  At 210,000 miles I have never had to replace anything on the engine - it's entirely cherry.  After the break in period I only changed the oil every 25,000 miles while changing the filter every 5,000 miles.  Not only did I get gas mileage so good no one believed me (20 mpg winter, 23 mpg summer)but it didn't cost any more than conventional oils and I never had a problem with my truck.  I recently sold my truck to a guy who couldn't wait to get his hands on it and I now run Mobil 1 in my 2008 Ford Ranger 4 cylinder and am getting 40 mpg (OK, 34 mpg with the engine running, 40 mpg by hypermiling)."
2786,5,"I have several of the Battery Tender Jr's and they all work perfect. I never have a dead battery on items I rarely use.  It's better to have several of these vs on multi battery charger, so you can connect them to vehicles that are not grouped together. The multi chargers are good if you take the batteries out and charge them together but who wants to  do that. Just buy a few of these and hook right up to the vehicle or boat where they sit. Use an extension cord if needed."
2787,5,"After looking at many luggage carriers both hard and soft side, I decided to give the Kar Pak a try because of price and the reviews I read on Amazon.  We took it to the Black Hills becuase we wanted to free up vehicle space so we put all the luggage on top.  On the way across South Dakota the wind blew 30 to 45 mph, it made it to the Black Hills in one piece with all our lugguage.  It never rained the whole weekend so we did not get to test the water proof part!"
2788,1,"BUYER BEWARE, THIS ITEM WILL PIT WITHIN MONTHS OF PURCHASE. HAVE NOT HEARD ANYTHING FROM PUTCO. PAID $300+ FOR KIT. THANKS PUTCO!"
2789,5,I am very happy with this purchase. Have 2 other cars with K&N's installed and wouldn't have it any other way. Pay a little more up front but the savings in fuel and replacement costs are worth it. They are a breeze to clean and re-oil. Buy one.. You won't regret it!
2790,1,"I bought this vac to keep our car clean with three children.  It was unable to pick up even the smallest things like grass.  Overall, this product was a waste of money."
2791,5,"Have had for several years, very well made, hold up under heavy use, just a scrub brush, soap and hot water and they look good as new.Love them."
2792,5,"This was purchased as a gift, and it turned out to be a duplicate.  The customer service at this place couldn't be better.  I mean there could be NO IMPROVEMENT - they were the BEST.      JKCavanaugh"
2793,5,"Great product. Easy install and looks nice.  It has a nice finish on it and you can change out the o-rings on the knob (yellow, blue, red and black) with ease.  Adds a real sporty feel to the ride.  You have to make sure to tighten down the 3 allens or you will have a tough time screwing on the bottom cap. Nice upgrade for very little cash. Highly recommended."
2794,1,"The compressor had obviously been used as the styrofoam packing in the box had been damaged and the compressor wasn't packed neatly. Also, there was a damage on one of the mounting brackets. Next, the valve wouldn't fit a standard tire schrader valve; I had to make some adjustments to make it fit my tire valve. Also, the hose leaked at the compressor end. Finally, the thing stopped working after less than two months so I had to purchase a different compressor. <br /> <br />"
2795,5,I have a pair in my truck and now my camper..  They work great and fit perfect.
2796,5,"Product represented a great value--a lot for the money, especially compared to local auto supply stores.  Thanks for the prompt service too!"
2797,4,"I bought this product to keep in the car in event of emergency.  Sure enough, about a month after purchase my car wouldn't start. <br /> <br />I found that even though the Simple Start has a small flashlight on it, it is not bright enough to see the labels on the control buttons in the dark.  (remember, if your battery is dead, there is no overhead light). <br /> <br />The battery in my car was over three years old, and dead.  Really dead.  Even the Simple Start would not recharge it.   <br /> <br />I recommend this product as part of your car's emergency kit, but only part.  Still carry your cell phone, flash light, etc. <br />"
2798,5,"Purchase/Shipping:  I researched this product for several weeks both online and at local retailers.  The online price was the best deal by as much as 50% less vs. what local stores wanted and they still had to order it for delivery to the store.    The standard shipping was reasonably quick and arrived in a large but easy to handle factory box. Use care if cutting open the box with a knife, as there is minimal padding to prevent cutting the cover.    Installation:  I installed it myself in about 45 minutes.  The instructions were decent; reading them once or twice did the trick to understand the recommendations from the manufacturer.  For my particular installation, factory under-the-rail bed liner with separate rail covers or rail caps, I simply needed to trim the bed rail covers flush with the edge of the bed.  I accomplished this with a pencil to mark the position of the locking brackets and a strong utility knife to cut and score the plastic bed rails and snap off the excess with pliers. Once that was completed simply affix the included gaskets/seal around the bottom of the cover to create a seal and adjust the height of the locking brackets and your done.    Use:  The tri-fold design allows you to partially cover the bed, but your choices are a completely covered bed or 1/3 covered.  There is not a way to secure the cover 2/3's of the way.  In the 1/3 bed cover position the cover snaps on each side with tabs to secure it.  The tabs, which are at the front or nearest the cab of the truck, stay visible all the time but after a few weeks you hardly notice them when not in use.  This cover has a very study metal frame, the instruction limit the weight to approximately 200 lbs, and while I've never tested that limit, my 5 year old boy climbs on it all the time without me worrying of damaging it or him.    On the road:  Weatherproofing is pretty good.  I've taken the truck through high-pressure automatic car washes and the bed stays dry.  And with transporting cargoon rainy days on and off the highway I've had no problems with water getting in.  The instructions do point out that it's not a waterproof installation, but I have no complaints.  At highway speeds there is some rising up of the cover in the middle to the rear, which is to be expected of the vinyl/material cover, but nothing too annoying or extreme.      Conclusion:  Over all I am pleased with the purchase and would recommend this product for permanent use. And with the ease of a one-man (or woman) fold up and removal for full use of your bed, it can't be beat."
2799,4,"This unit is very effective.  I used it to inflate my car tires from 25 to 30 psi.  It took approximately 3 seconds per tire.  The noise wasn't as loud as I expected, but it does vibrate, as another reviewer mentioned.  The only con is that the four screws on the silver cover (on top of the machine) are merely for decorative purposes, as I discovered when the cover popped off, exposing the dried glue that was holding it together.  I used a bit of Liquid Nails to bond it back together.  Other than that, I am completely satisfied with the performance and accuracy of this product."
2800,5,"All of my 2\\"" hitch units work fine with this adapter.  I downsized from a SUV with a 2\\"" and went to a compact car with a 1 1/4\\"".  This allows me to use my bike carriers, luggage racks, etc."
2801,2,"these stands held my car ok, but compared to some other 3 ton rated stands that I purchased locally for the same price, they were not nearly as heavily made, kind of chinsy. Look elsewhere."
2802,5,"The item was in brand new and exactly what I expected.  The service including delivery, packaging etc. was excellant"
2803,4,"As a backyard mechanic I was frustrated with the new cars and the check engine light that results in a $60 charge to read at a garage.  Now that the price of a reader is less than $80 it makes sense to try the Equus Innova 3030 car reader and I was happy I did.  It works great and is easy to use but does have a minor problem I discovered.  My Subaru would not communicate with the 3030. The tech support phone line was tied up, but they quickly responded to my email and sent me a new Innova 3030 with a new chip set.  Apparently Subarus, Mazdas and Volkswagons tend to have a problem in communication and in this case require a newer chip set in the 3030 which apparently works on all brands (I checked my Honda and toyota OK), so if you have one of the former car brands ask for the newer chip set.  The manual has one misprint and the key must be turned to on position before plugging the 3030 into the car. Tech support at the website was great and called back later. I had already saved $60 on reading my codes plus saved $80 labor by installing a failed sensor myself although I think many other codes require a shop manual to actually track down the problem part. In summary a great tool for backyard mechanics to read the codes, fix the car and turn off the check engine light."
