0,5,Great book met my expectation
1,4,"&#34;Ready to use&#34; is the key here.  Very useful and covering a variety of geographic topics.  I searched through a lot of similar books looking for activities to augment my grades 4-6 summer course, and this was the only book that really worked for me."
2,5,THIS BOOK IS PHENOMENAL - A REAL EYE OPENER
3,5,I purchased this book from a recommendation from an editor friend.  I'm so glad I did.  Angela Ackerman's book really helped me incorporate emotion into my manuscripts.  It book is easy to use.  The only negative aspect of the book is I wish Ms. Ackerman included more emotional descriptors.  This book is a must have for all new and experienced writers!
4,4,"I've enjoyed much of John Price's work before and this book is as informative.  It IS a bit of a slow read for me, mostly due to the small print and type face.  But thus far, and I'm only in Chap. 3, it seems to be on a par with his other works.  A great many universal truths are revealed!"
5,5,"A superb insight into the impact of trauma on brain development, this book helps give a new understanding into the inner worlds of our most troubled young minds along with a fresh approach to treatment of trauma disorders."
6,5,Best read of the summer - so smart and makes total sense.  Every teacher should read this regardless of your school's situation.
7,5,Such a great author.
8,5,"This book is about Fritz Newton’s fifth birthday where he doesn’t feel different from four. But at the end he feels five after a helping action.<br />The main character is Fritz Newton. Fritz learns to ride his bike with training wheels, he can count his age on one hand, he learns to do monkey bars and he practices to reach the apples when he was four. I feel five! is a picture book.<br />My favorite part of the book is when the girl asked if Fritz could reach the apples and after thinking for a minute Fritz Newton bounces, zooms, soars and plucks two perfect apples. I liked this part because this made Fritz Newton feel a little different, may be a little more five at the end.<br />Illustrations are very beautiful and it helped to know more about the story. In a picture, Fritz Newton’s Dad taught him to reach the apples when he was four and he can reach the apples for a girl when he is five on his own. I liked this book because it is fun and has many pictures.<br />I felt same like Fritz Newton when he was doing the monkey bars, when he tried to whistle and when he tried to snap his fingers. All the little kids will love this book because it is so much fun and it explains how a kid will feel when he tries learning new things.<br /><br />Shrisha.K, 5, San Diego mensa"
9,5,AS DESCRIBED
10,5,"Bunkong Tuon is a very good and skilled poet. This, his first book, is an excellent start to what will likely be a long and talented career. It's a biographical book arranged largely chronologically about his life as a Cambodian refugee escaping the Khmer Rouge with his grandmother, coming to America to a new life and the challenges that presented. He describes growing up on the East Coast, being teased and bullied because of his Asian heritage. He describes his family's dedication to one another and his mother's death at the hands of Pol Pot. He gives us his moving to the West Coast, to Long Beach, with family members, to a new life there as a teenager. He describes his (bad) career as a student, his jobs working in warehouses and as a custodian. We learn of his going to the Long Beach City Library and his discovery of Charles Bukowski, which changed his life and his learning forever. I can certainly relate to that because I, too, hated most poetry and literature until I discovered Bukowski myself and he opened up a whole new world to me, one in which any type of poetry with any topic was possible. It kick started my career as a poet.<br /><br />Tuon went on to go to Cal State Long Beach (my alma mater), graduating and going on to graduate school back on the East Coast. Along the way, he meets his wife, who is also an academic and they enjoy discussing literature and academics. After he gets his doctorate, he's surprised to be given a job at a small liberal arts college in New York, where he is today and writes of his students and his teaching, his wife's efforts to finish her own studies, and her attempts to learn Khmer culture. There's a lot of sadness and humor in this book and it makes for a nice, comprehensive look at his life. The book is divided into sections, many of which are titled things like &#34;East Coast&#34; and &#34;West Coast,&#34; etc. However, I think his last section, &#34;Cambodia,&#34; stands out the most for me. In it, he writes of his relatives in Cambodia and his birth, the destiny of his wife's and his births and lives, his uncle and his aspirations, and what I think is the most powerful and impressive poem, &#34;Inheritance,&#34; in which he gives us the Cambodian dead, destroyed temples and monks, child soldiers, and more. It's quite moving.<br /><br />Overall, this is a strong book of poetry, especially for a first effort. It's narrative poetry, free verse, but not as lively as Bukowski, so if you're expecting gambling, drinking, and whores, you won't find it here. What you will find is a unique perspective on a Cambodian man living in a world different from the one of his youth, a person dealing with ghosts, trying to make a new life with a new spouse in a new profession and enjoying life in the process. And it's a good process to read about.

11,3,"I had high hopes for this book, but was very disappointed. First, I found his writing style to be patronizing and even condescending at times. Some passages were sarcastic and meant to be funny, but read as him viewing himself as some kind of savior to the field. Secondly, (even for those outside the field of human factors), I'm worried this book is too superficial. I enjoyed the examples, but found the overall message to be one that encourages simplicity and efficiciency over complex human cognition. I understand the premise, but disagree on his approach. Thirdly, the book was extremely redundant. The same superficial ideas are rehashed over and over, to the point where even someone outside of the field would think, &#34;Seriously man, I get it! I got it two pages ago! Please move on to something else!&#34;<br /><br />It's clear that he has given up on the field of psychology in understanding human factors: as he put it, he needed to change the name of the book from The Psychology of Everyday Things, in part because &#34;Bookstores placed the book in their psychology section (along with books on sex, love, and self-help).&#34; That condescending sentence says a lot about how he views the field of psychology in human factors.<br /><br />I might recommend this book for a professor who needs to get their seminar interested in the very basic applied psychology of design, but I would not recommend using this book as any type of hard learning tool."
12,5,Its a wonderful account about a truly wonderful individual's captivating life.
13,4,"I enjoyed the book, about two prominent Lebanese artist and their times, though the group of Boston artists that they embraced were unknown to me."
14,4,good book
15,5,"All actions are the results of thoughts. This well thought book offers a glimpse of the path Will Bonsall has taken.  It is a book-journey I would highly recommend and felt privileged to read.  He has embarked (no pun intended-ramial) on a minimalist traverse of this world. Fortunately he has given a written record before like all of us he returns to earth.  Like any visionary his path of life and sustenance deviates from the majority opinion. There is much to learn from his musings and dry humor.  One can see he has made his Garden of Eden and has well tended it.  I loved his chapter on tools showing what little he needs and pictures of the same well used.  In our lives filled with ticky tacky he reverently seeks the necessary, renewable and sustainable.  His spirit and passion is zealous and this is a writing to read.  There is much to be learned in his writing and I wish him well.  Hopefully there is more writing to come.  ER Lindsey"
16,5,Great format can't wait to build something.
17,5,Gift
18,5,From the first chapter I couldn't put this book down! Made me feel like I was back on the island as a kid again. If the vineyard is a part of your life you HAVE to read this book. 5 stars!
19,5,"Always have loved, &#34; Little House on the Prairie&#34; and wanted to know about Laura Ingalls Wilder.....Loved the book!!"
20,5,This is a great coloring book for adults! Thank you.
21,1,"It stated it comes with a mastering key access, but it didn't now I'm stuck with the book and no access key."
22,5,Really good book. For good insight in self in this fast paced life.
23,5,Great item
24,5,"Love this book.  I found it at the public library and loved it so much I ordered my own copy.  It gives me all the information I need in order to compost.  I have been tossing things in a pile for years and never got it to heat up.  Using the guidelines in this book, I now have a very active, HOT compost pile, started a worm vermicompost bin, and various other composting projects.  I consider this book my &#34;compost bible.&#34;"
25,5,"This is a wonderful 31 [brief, 3-page] chapter devotional. I'm reading one a day for this month, and plan to reread it periodically. I believe I can trust Franklin Graham to guide me in the right direction in my attempts to learn from and follow the Lord Jesus."
26,2,Totally an academic's &#34;What if&#34; writing
27,5,Very good guide to identification and value of paper money
28,5,"Arrived on time, beautiful bound book.  Would definitely purchase from Ellie Claire again!"
29,3,All excellent books for young investors. They have made much money for me. Thanks to Prince Jack.
30,5,"I bought this book for my kids,great book."
31,2,"A little worse shape than I expected,but it was alright."
32,3,"This is the third book of the author's trilogy on slavery's history leading to emancipation.  I read the first volume of that trilogy, The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture, on 5 April 2001, because it won the Pulitzer prize for nonfiction in 1967.  I have never read the second volume but this volume, entitled The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Emancipation, won the National Book Critics Circle prize in 2014 and so I read it. It is only the 14th such winner I've read (out of 39 winners),  The author spends a lot of time discussing the question of what should be the situation if the slaves in the U.S. were free, with some who were against slavery saying the freed should be sent to Africa--the racist mindset of such colonists being clear that they did not want the freed slaves in this country even though though they were born here.  While some were sent to Liberia that was never the preference of the slaves themselves and  gradually the abolitionists came to see  that colonization was the preference of  the racist-minded.  The closing chapters of the book were of greater interest to me, since they culminate of course in emancipation--which the author says would not have happened without war because slavery was profitable for the slaveholders.  This is a carefully-researched book full of evidence of the results of long years of study."
33,5,"I loved this book! Great character development, theme, honesty of topic. Look forward to seeing more from Ms. Upshall."
34,5,awesome tribute to a great man!
35,5,Love my book!
36,5,.  Beautiful colored photos of the birds that visit my birdfeeder.  I already have a copy of my own and purchased this one for another bird lover.
37,5,I bought this set for my grandson.  He is already on the third book and loves the series!
38,4,"4.25 stars----FOURTH DEBT is the fifth installment in Pepper Winters’s  contemporary, adult Indebted dark, erotic romance series focusing on a six hundred year old debt the Hawk family believes comes due with the first born Weaver daughter-and Nila Weaver is this generation’s payment. FOURTH DEBT is the continuing story of Nila Weaver’s struggles to remain sane and unbroken in the face of her impending death. FOURTH DEBT should not be read as a stand alone as each installment builds upon the events of the previous storylines wherein our heroine pays the price for her ancestor’s sins.<br /><br />Told from dual first person perspectives FOURTH DEBT follows a grieving Nila as she comes to terms with the greatest loss of her life. No amount of torture or pain can break past the numbness in her heart and her head until a new round of payment extractions finds our heroine facing the worst debt of all.<br /><br />The premise of FOURTH DEBT continues to be disturbing, dark and demonic. The Hawk family’s need to extract payment comes with it a psychotic need for vengeance and blood. The storyline is awash in graphic details, violent abusive scenarios, and torture all inflicted upon a young woman whose only sin is to be born into the Weaver clan.<br /><br />FOURTH DEBT reveals some of the Hawk family history: their sickening and violent past; their need for sadistic revenge and payment in blood; their history of forbidden love. The storyline is intense, traumatic and not for the faint of heart.<br /><br />FOURTH DEBT and the INDEBTED SERIES is an emotional storyline of betrayal and revenge; kidnapping, torture and abuse; love and sacrifice in the face of extraordinary circumstances. The reader is caught in a web of horror; a house of suffering and pain unlike anyone could imagine and through it all our heroine remains steadfast in her love for the man who dropped her into the middle of the unending nightmare.<br /><br />Pepper Winters’s storylines are controversial and intense; the build up of tension, suspense and anxiety will reach levels of pain and heartache. Her characters are dark, impassioned, and many without a heart or soul. The destructive and twisted nature of greed and revenge lends it focus to a debt where interest continues to grow with each successive generation. No one is safe once the Hawk family demand payment…and payment will be made one way or another.l and intense; the build up of tension, suspense and anxiety will reach levels of pain and heartache.

45,4,"Helen Garner takes us inside a trial, the result of a tragic incident resulting in the death of three young boys. Did their father wreak a dreadful revenge on his estranged wife? We see the presentation of evidence and feel the changing emotions of Garner and the other members of the public gallery. As it is a such tragic true story, I felt somewhat trepidatious reading it, but the book is so well written, that while subject matter is harrowing the end result is rewarding"
46,5,"There's no clue in A Cry of Shadows that Jack Dwyer would not be back. No hint his strangest and most engrossing mystery would be his last—the last one he solves, anyway. The biggest mystery, his disappearance, remains to this day.<br /><br />It's been a quarter century since Dwyer, the cop who went private so he could pursue an acting career, went the way of Amelia Earhart. His creator, Ed Gorman, was at the top of his game. A Cry of Shadows was the fifth Jack Dwyer novel in Gorman's debut crime series. It won the admiration of top writers in the genre:<br /><br />Road to Perdition author Max Allan Collins: “A Cry of Shadows is a brave, sad novel that will both move and shock readers. In a genre awash with trendy, yuppie private eyes, Jack Dwyer is a convincing man of the people.”<br /><br />Loren D. Estleman: “A Cry of Shadows bears echoes of the early John D. MacDonald. Ed Gorman's lean prose and deep compassion set his books apart from everything else in the genre.”<br /><br />Bill Pronzini: “Gorman at his most daring—a detective novel that is also a novel of character, social conscience and quiet horror.”<br /><br />I agree with everything these guys said. As for F. Paul Wilson's prediction when it came out in 1990 that A Cry of Shadows “will touch you as deeply as anything you'll read this year,” it touched me as deeply as anything I've read in recent memory. It's out of print. I first read it last night, thanks to the Internet and people who sell used books.<br /><br />I'd already read the first four Jack Dwyer mysteries on my laptop. Gordian Knot Books recently reissued them on Kindle. The first four, along with Gorman's debut crime novel, Rough Cut, which Gordian Knot mistakenly calls the first Jack Dwyer mystery. I can understand the mistake, as the protagonist, Michael Ketchum, is clearly Jack Dwyer trapped in an advertising executive's body, which Gorman clearly recognized at some point, releasing him to be himself in the subsequent Dwyer novels. But that Gordian Knot has failed to reissue A Cry of Shadows—the last and best of the series—is the bigger mistake. Fortunately, with the ease and speed of ebook publishing, it should be easily correctable. As it is, my St. Martin's Press first edition of A Cry of Shadows, originally owned by the Peters Township Library in McMurray, PA, will some day be a valuable collectible.<br /><br />About the novel? The story? Jack Dwyer's final case? Rather than try to rewrite whomever wrote the fine jacket flap teaser—I'm guessing Ed Gorman himself--I'll simply give you a little of that evocative prose:<br /><br />&#34;It is Christmastime. Inside the fashionable Avanti nightclub, the young, rich, and self-indulgent patrons celebrate with fine, exotic cuisine and the best champagne amid warm and inviting surroundings. Outside, in the bitter cold, shadowy derelicts beg for scraps of food, sleep where and when they can, and live out their existences in bleak anonymity.<br /><br />&#34;Two worlds in seeming opposition: one full of light and warmth and pleasure, the other full of darkness and cold and misery. Yet something connects them. Something deadly.&#34;<br /><br />Jack Dwyer may be gone for good, but he's left us with some haunting memories, A Cry of Shadows the most haunting of all.ry of Shadows—the last and best of the series—is the bigger mistake.

47,5,A great guide still relevant after all these years.
48,4,Fun.
49,5,"loved it, a little sad written after fatty has left us. well written and very factual."
50,5,What can I say. A great story
51,5,Amazing book
52,5,"Very thorough, detailed book, with many, many production statistics, which will be of much interest to readers who desire such details."
53,5,Brilliantly conceptualised! I was immersed in the story living through the characters as it seamlessly traversed time and Geography. It is packed with History. A must read for all ages!
54,5,Excellent companion for those entering the counseling field.
55,5,"This book is proving to be a blessing in our daily Bible readings.  The slant on each mentioned scripture brings it new meaning, deeper meaning."
56,5,ok series
57,5,Great!
58,5,Passed it on to people I know who are in the wilds often. Would be good read for people who think animals are all lovey dovey-especially people who are going to visit Yellowstone-ha! Especially liked the results of bear spray vs. gun although I would still want the gun handy.
59,5,Cutest book!!! I have been buying it for my friends that have had babies.
60,2,"I love the study of viruses but did not like this book. I found the writing to be inconsistent, either really broad or really in-depth. It's good enough for a primer on viruses, our teacher did her best to use the book well, but I would not recommend the book."
61,4,I really enjoyed this book!
62,5,Great book...great price..fast shipping
63,5,"Several decades ago I spent a considerable amount of time querying young people in regards to their understanding of the Declaration of Independence whose preamble defined and emphasized the natural rights that belong to every individual. Since I was able to recite the preamble from memory I was shocked that not one of these youth, even vaguely, understood that our God given rights were clearly stipulated within this document. My parents were both patriots but it was not they who were responsible for my having committed the preamble of the Declaration to memory. It was my high school American History teacher who demanded that the entire class do so. What public school teacher would do so today? What public school teacher could do so today? Generations of Americans have been denied the education required to maintain our republic and many have, alternatively, been successfully indoctrinated to dislike core American values, culture, traditions, history and the very men who gave us the Constitution upon which our republic is founded.<br /><br />America, once a land of opportunity that people the world over sought to immigrate to, based upon the organic principles of individual liberty and free markets, has become a nation more akin to the places people have fled from. Opportunity has been stymied by regulations and taxes. Radical egalitarianism has changed the concept of opportunity to one of redistribution using a pseudo altruism and implemented by a powerful, omnipresent central federal authority which represents the worst possible scenario that the 9th and 10th Constitutional Amendments sought to prevent. All branches of government, in complete disregard for the separation of powers doctrine, have melded together so as to act uniformly, in concert, not only against the will of the people but, even more importantly, against the very Constitution designed to prevent such a central coalition of power. Federal agencies and bureaucracies have escaped the confines of the Constitutional bulwarks and firewalls and rule with an iron fist from which there is often no recourse to defy their tyranny. Career, professional politicians are bought and paid for by lobbyists looking to achieve advantages not afforded by free markets and capitalism but by exception from government implemented regulations designed to restrain their competition. Large swaths of our population has succumbed to a reliance and dependency on government for medical care, retirement, food, clothing and shelter which can only be afforded by heavy taxation and borrowing implemented by inefficient government bureaucrats at a cost which is predicted to outdistance and devour our entire GDP for decades in order to succeed. America is heading towards an unsustainable future and it is doing so more rapidly than was ever imagined.<br /><br />Americans have had enough from the masters of the universe, the elites, the Washington based insiders whose covetousness of power and control has gone beyond critical mass. The American people have hired republicans en masse to do what they campaigned upon and promised. These politicians have been deceitful. To address their failure Donald Trump has heralded their deceit which earned him an instantaneous advantage within the republican field of primary candidates. Democrats, such as Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid and Barack Obama love the direction American is heading. It is a progressive direction whose ethos, when adopted by governments, has failed since Plato’s pathos attempted to supplant Hellenic World democracy with his vision of utopia.<br /><br />Mark Levin is doing what American Education has failed to do for decades. He is a historian, a Constitutional scholar, a philosopher and through both his radio show and books a superb educator who delivers powerful incriminations against progressive liberal ideology and politics. He addresses our political crisis through the hindsight of history and reminds us of the applicable solutions offeredby the Founders of our Constitution, a document from which we have drifted, which has been criticized by Justice Ginsberg as inadequate for modern times and hailed by Ayn Rand as the single greatest legislative achievement in the history of Western Civilization. He is my High School American History teacher who familiarized her classes with the Declaration of Independence. He is an oracle through which the vision of our founders and their mentors is transmitted to generations of Americans who have been stigmatized against our nation by a centrally controlled education system and a media which continues to do so post graduation. I believe that this will be the greatest educational book he has written. Im sure, as always, it will challenge us to understand that our liberty is bequeathed by natural law which each individual is heir to and which no government has the authority to deny.<br /><br />Mark Levin is a national resource and beyond that an ardent animal lover, a quality some believe has a lot to do with why he is also a national treasure.y the Founders of our Constitution, a document from which we have drifted, which has been criticized by Justice Ginsberg as inadequate for modern times and hailed by Ayn Rand as the single greatest legislative achievement in the history of Western Civilization.

64,5,Nice follow-up to the first book.
65,5,Good experience in purchasing this book.Everything great.
66,5,Can hardly wait for the next Will Thomas novel.  I thoroughly enjoy his style and characterization.  Plots are interesting even though I have read hundreds of books and there is nothing much new out there.  I hope Mr. Thomas has many more of these up his sleeve.<br />Dick Urban
67,5,"I have been fascinated by Lise Meitner since I read about the element Meitnerium in a book about the elements. I looked for whatever information I could find on her on the internet but it is very dry. Indeed, she has never maintained the public image that Marie Curie has. I have no idea how anyone as pioneering as Lise could become so forgotten about, but what makes this book great is that we get to see Lise Meitner the person, not just the scientist."
68,5,"What a well written all encompassing cookbook, so happy to add it to my collection!"
69,5,"I am an engineer brushing up on my electric skills to design robots around my house.  I haven't taken electrical engineering in some time, but have found this book a great substitute to the pricey Principles and Applications of Electrical Engineering Dec 13, 2005 by Giorgio Rizzoni, which I used during college, but alas cannot find the book anywhere in my house.  Anyways, this book covers the same topics and is as well organized as Rizzoni's.  Save the money and get this, you won't be disappointed."
70,5,great
71,1,Soon you won't be able to give this book away.
72,4,History !!
73,5,Highly recommended. It is a pretty interesting read. You can finish it over a weekend.<br />This book important details about how money works and is narrated like an interesting story.
74,5,I'm still reading the book but have marked a number of recipes to make quick home-made &#34;fast foods&#34;.  It's Great!
75,4,"Arrived on time. Good historical analysis of a complex individual from American history. Quite the complex study, research was very in depth. A good read."
76,5,Genres like this truly make me excited. Gangsters behind the scenes and controlling the economy through sheer influence and the powerful will of manliness makes me love Mario Puzo and his The Godfather as well as most of his other works.
77,2,Fabulous - it exceeded my expectation.  Rick is a fabulous author - I feel present with his fabulous writing.  I encourage all to read it - great perspective on people - quite often misunderstood.
78,1,dumb<br />this is a page with the majority of Van Gogh's picture and then a couple of dozen stickers of his version of the &#34;stars&#34; to stick on the picture.  I am not at all sure what the point was supposed to be.  I actually bothered returning it even though it was less than $2.
79,5,Very interesting and spiritual book.
80,5,Now if only my bitch wife would cook.
81,3,"Another book about how to live your live, didn't say anything I knew already, basically, Carpe Diem."
82,5,This is a wonderful book for yogis of all experience levels. One of the biggest challenges of yoga (especially when practicing at home) is having proper alignment and form. This book uses text and images to thoroughly explain how to position yourself in a large library. Sean's yoga and fitness expertise comes through on every page. I highly recommend this book for anyone interest in introducing yoga into their fitness routine or refining their practice.
83,4,"Funny stuff, enjoyed this book, quite a bit...."
84,5,"Powerful. Stan knows for sure how to take you from putting fire under your employee to putting fire within your employees! A must read if you want your employee to follow you not because they have to but because they want to.<br />Jean-Philippe (JP) Mula, Director of Support Effectiveness, LinkedIn."
85,5,The tests were great and the answer keys and discussions were great.  I used these tests to quickly narrow down where my son needed some additional focus.  It was an invaluable tool in helping him study for the exam.
86,5,"great cook book, easy to follow recipes, if you like Turkish or Middle Eastern cooking you will enjoy this book"
87,5,Waited for this on Backorder.  Worth the wait.
88,4,"Interesting read. I loved the main character Emmalyn. She was 3-D and realistic. Her struggles were sincere and made me really think. Of course, I loved her best friend, Boozie/Boughie Unfortunate. (Great name, right?) She was wise, and funny, and colorful and made me want a BFF just like her. AND the FOOD!! Fair warning, do not read this book when you are hungry."
89,4,"A good read the story is different that what I usually read but it grabs you and pulls you in. The characters are well thought out and there are no real slow parts to this book. There are twists and turns a plenty. I recommend this for anyone looking for a different take on the genre,."
90,5,"In spare prose, Molly Gloss manages to convey more realistically than any factual history book the mean, desperately hard lives of the people who settled the West. Her characters have no emotional or social sophistication, but they know how to do the work of survival with skills that few modern people possess. I was captivated all the way through and was left with a deep appreciation for those who gained a foothold in Oregon (so I could live here) and with gratitude for all the conveniences—and fresh vegetables—we so take for granted. Yes, the white settlers did enormous damage to the environment and the natives, but they really didn't know any better. This book simply conveys without sentimentality what life was like in the late 1800s in backcountry Oregon."
91,5,Great
92,5,"I own over 200 cookbooks and was a professional Executive Chef for many years, and I have to say that this is the best cookbook I own, and one of the few I ever use."
93,5,Awesome book. Beautiful cover and condition of book was great when I received it. Great buy!
94,5,Good.
95,5,"Luigi Cassinelli’s book, The Photographer’s Choice, is more than a book about photography. It is a book about photographing truth and showing reality as the light allows us to display it. It is a deep questioning of the world as it is presented today by the picture-takers (all of us), who have been lulled into believing that today’s images, as presented on paper, represent the true world in which we live – not the world we wish for.<br /><br />  Cassinelli, like Don Quixote, launches an assault on the windmills of the media conglomerate and asks us (almost implores us) to dig deep into our souls and to show the world as it is. He gives us the instrument to explore the definition of digital photography, so that we make an educated judgment on the benefits and detriments of this type of image presentation.<br /><br />  Cassinelli is a man on a mission. All of those who have gone into a deep soul-searching, as he has to present his case, must have a receptive audience before we perish into the mushroom world of Alice in Wonderland. He writes, “Anytime we worship aesthetic ideas and hold reality in contempt, we create our own cage and give up freedom. The result is alienation.” If you want a massage, not a message, don’t read this book, but if you value your freedom, The Photographer’s Choice is a must-read for your reading list."
96,5,Awesome:)
97,5,This is a great book of scripts and techniques/ideas to write one's own scripts.
98,5,I've been using this as a resource for summer learning for my child entering the sixth grade. Absolutely awesome lesson plan for the summer as well as answers lol.
99,5,"This is a great version of classic Shakespeare that provides easy to understand notes to help facilitate understanding while reading. If you have avoided reading Shakespeare because of the difficulty in reading his works, this is a great choice for you!"
100,5,"Sinful Intent was the perfect first book for the ALFA Private Investigations series. Being that it is a sort of cross-over series, it combines the perfect mixture of old and new characters. You won't have had to read the Men of Inked series if you haven't, but be warned, it will make you want to.<br />Chelle has the ability as an author to make you fall in love with every character. She spins a tale of love while weaving in mystery and suspense, humor, and steamy sexiness all while giving you the sense of being right there living in the moment with them page by page.<br />I could not put it down and cannot wait for the next book. It is a phenomenal read and Chelle gets better and better with every book!"
101,4,I enjoyed this cookbook. I has included recipes and plans for 20 dinners from beginning to end including drinks. I don't believe this will be my go to cookbook though. There aren't a lot of recipes that look appealing to me and not necessarily my taste but I'm sure many will like them. It is a very nice hardback book with beautiful photography throughout. If you are a foodie I believe you will like this one. I personally have a southern pallet and this doesn't cater to that. Maybe I will venture out of my comfort zone and find a recipe that I like. Many of the recipes include ingredients that I don't like or that I normally would purchase.
102,5,My sons favorite book series!
103,3,"I purchased this pocket guide for the Spring 2015 semester along with the larger text. To be honest, I did not even use this guide. My instructor recommended that I purchase it and that I could bring it along with me during my clinicals, but I never even used it. It is short and straight to the point and can help you when you have the time to look-up information during your clinicals."

105,5,Our 8yr old daughter loved reading this book......
106,5,5 stars
107,5,This was a well written book that was about a murder in Van Buren Arkansas in 1981. I am from there and it was neat to read about people you knew and others that you knew about. As far as I can tell it is factually correct. I went to the author's presentation and book signing and I will go again just to hear the way she researched and wrote the book. I would highly recommend going to one of these presentations if the opportunity presents itself. I would call this book an easy read. I would say you probably can't put it down when you start it.
108,3,Good history that I lived through but the writer's extreme left wing bias was hard to take. Dislike extremist on both sides.
109,5,Wonderful recipes. Love it!
110,4,"(Janelle here)  Our son loves the Duck and Goose books.  This one teaches him about opposites, but the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it is super short and is literally one word a page...not very long at all.  So, while it get's the idea across (which is the point, I suppose! haha), I wish it were longer."
111,5,for school
112,5,"This was a great read!  And it's the fifth published book in Emilie Richards' Shenandoah Album series.  Just awe inspiring how she weaves key characters from past books of this series into this book.  Everyone comes together and relationships click together in her quilt of intrigue.  I loved the character of Jamie in this novel.  I had read the entire series before I realized that each one (each book) was named after a specific quilt stitch.  Ms Richards does such a great job with the heroine in each book.  Her books combine mystery, romance, history, complex characters, and surprise twists of fate that take the reader on an adventure as real as any so-called &#34;action&#34; novel.  I disagreed with only one part of 'Sister's Choice' when Jamie verbally outed John Cashell Rosslyn so harshly.  I won't explain anymore, so it wont spoil your own excitement of discovery as you peruse this excellent story!  Its a fairly fat book, about 547 pages, but I couldn't put it down!  Read it quicly- in between work and travel, consuming it voraciously!  Every Emilie Richards book I have picked up so far has not disappointed me!  Thank you Ms. Richards!!"
113,5,Fun little book. I wish they came out with a 100-card package. Very interesting. I use these in postcard exchange with foreign traders and it's always popular. (PostCrossing dot com).

118,5,"Book 2 of Jokers' Wrath MC club did not disappoint. I was very excited for Maddox and Santana's story after the ending of book 1 (Precarious). Santana has a past and Maddox was her savior. They haven't had an easy time of it and they've been dancing around each other until events push them together or tear them apart. So many of the elements that captured my attention in book 1 are back in this book, the action, the hot sex, and the MC family. Bella Jewel's characters captured my heart and took me on a roller coaster. There were times I laughed, times, I cried and times I wanted to scream at either Maddox, Santana or both. I became so engaged with this story, Maddox's soft side was so intriguing, and Santana has so much unprocessed emotion locked up inside her, that the story wasn't predictable. Outside the relationship, the story line that focuses on the business of the MC club is full of action, violence, and so much more.<br /><br />I highly recommend this story, but I recommend reading Precarious first. I'm looking forward to Mack's story in Anguish."
119,5,"What can I say? Zed Shaw is hilarious. The book does exactly what it promises you to do. You are absolutely thrown to the wolves, and just when you think you won't be able to figure it out, he lets you come up for air. You learn the logic through working with examples and typing the exercises exactly as he's written them, then tinkering with the pieces yourself. Great book for a beginner like me. Rather than trying to make long-winded explanations work for you, he lets you get your hands dirty and gives you an infinite number of &#34;Aha&#34; moments when you figure out just how something in the Python language works. The command line crash course is also a great introduction to working in a shell. Buy this book, make sure you follow directions, and welcome to the world of coding."
120,3,"It's got a lot of information that is good, but I feel that it is a shame that the bible couldn't be used as a history to include more in it."
121,5,This book has a really good information for new ferret owners.
122,2,"I'm usually a Huge fan of all Louise Hay books and cards, but these are my least favorite. I read great reviews and was debating on getting this or buying a 4th box of the &#34;I CAN DO IT!&#34; cards, which I gave away as gifts, but wished I got for myself as well. Well my daughter and I read uplifting cards and messages daily as I'm trying to instill in her to always be positive and that no one likes a Debbie Downer, though we are entitled to throwourselves a pitty party every now and then.  These are not easy friendly to read, the cards are beautiful, but the coloring and writing of the saying don't make me feel comfort or at ease like all Louise Hay's other cards and sayings. I just don't care for these in my personal preference.  I'll keep them and continue to use them because they may just grow on me and I do believe that only positive things can come out of reading these."
123,5,Karen White never disappoints and I look forward to every new book.
124,5,"I was given a copy of this book personally signed by the author called Born To Magic Tales Of Nevaeh for free in exchange for my honest opinion. As most of my close friends and family members know me I am not a fast reader and not much of a reader at all. When presented with this opportunity I was excited as I have had options to review books before but none of them grabbed my attention enough to want to read it. This cover and description alone intrigued my curiosity.<br />I am one who loves things like sci-fi, mythological, fantasy, and the unknown, so this book was yelling at me to read it. I am still working on the book but have read quite a bit of it and not once did it loose my attention. It did however have me confused in the beginning but after I kept reading it all started to make sense to me. It is an easy read just the right print size for me. The words were not put in a dry format it kept me wanting to read more to find out more about the story line. The magic and creativity of this book makes me even more excited to finish the book all the way to find out what happens at the end.<br />The book was filled with detail throughout the whole story defining things and making it feel more interactive as if you could feel what Areenna was going threw and experience as she develops her strength and powers. The book is full creativity such as mutated animals but once described in such detail you are able to associate what real life animal it was mutated from. I hate to get into the book too much as I do not want to spoil the story but I could feel the power that Princess  Areenna and Prince Mikaal had in their first battle together and could feel how it drained their energy levels. I thought this book used well descriptive words to enhance and interact with the reader so they could experience the emotions and feelings as the story goes along.<br />This had both the right amount of science fiction and fantasy to keep my interest going."

128,1,"I have generously graded this book.  A book of this size, which purports to tell you &#34;every which way&#34; to prepare burgers does nothing like that. It does not give any information on fundamentals -- such as ingreadient consistency, or alternative combinations of veggies to use.  Instead the book is packed with fillers like slaws and potatoes, which pack the book with non essentials, in the very same way that Volger packs his burgers.  I really wish they gave book discounts, because this book is a complete rip - off."
129,5,Excellent. well written and captures Dumas characters very well.
130,5,"If you’re looking for a novel to pick up and get right into, this is your book. It is written so simply and in such a straightforward style that I’d almost call it beach-reading (a good thing, in my mind).  However, the plot thickens quickly and the story takes on heft as we come to understand that Wade’s adolescent dreams of being responsible and getting out from under the yoke of his mother are enchained in a young male fantasy of American individualism and “frontier spirit” that stands in direct conflict with the conditions of his life: an impoverished, dysfunctional family and a small-town high school, institutionally incapable of helping him find his way.  Young love, small-town life, guns, poverty, all feed into this subtle tale of the power of society and one’s parents to deal a death blow to real escape and enlightenment.  In view of the recent and ongoing stories of young men and guns, I’d say this novel is a must-read."
131,5,"I really only used this for the math portion, but it does give good advice. The practice tests are easily accessed online if you need to print them. However, a lot of the stuff I studied wasn't in the book, so I think I just got unlucky in terms of questions offered on the actual test."
132,5,Incredibly valuable for every believer and especially those in any form of leadership.  I highly recommend reading this and recommend reading it with those you are leading or a friend who is willing to be raw along side of you.  Dig in.  Drink deep.
133,5,"I really enjoyed this book. It's not very often that male perspective books hit the YA aisle lately. Most seem to be narrated by teen girls, so this was a nice change to get the male side of things. Fiona Wood did an awesome job of really getting into the head of an awkward teenage boy. Dan is a very endearing character. He's awkward and nerdy. He's a romantic at heart, swooning over his neighbor but unable to tell her. He is also dealing with some bigger issues, like the recent breakup of his family. His father has come out as gay and left his mother, leaving their finances in dire straights.<br /><br />This is a fun read with lots of heart. I would recommend it to teens as well as adult readers!"
134,5,"Arianna is CIA language expert being slowly seduced by a voice that belongs to the Russian arms dealer her agency is bugging. Luka's powerful charisma has him starring in her dreams, before even knowing what he looks like. Up to this point she's been a pencil pusher, waiting for an opportunity to prove herself in the field. Her chance finally arrives in the form of an undercover assignment to spy on Luka. How can she play the spy game successfully, when she can’t control herself around the target?<br /><br />I love romance and erotica books with Russian criminal elements. Luka's magnetism leaps off the page. You understand the fear, and desire the heroine is conflicted with. This serial was a fun trek through the Motherland's underbelly. Yet strangely enough sometimes found myself annoyed with the heroines work performance. Despite that, Arianna and Luka's romance was sexy, and intense.<br /><br />*I received this ARC in exchange for an honest review."
135,5,"I had read all the positive reviews about Assimil all over so I tried it. I have done many other courses but this one is special.  What sets it apart it is a painless method  the recordings are entertaining and add lots of vocabulary.  The daily units often have a punch line which seems to help you remember the vocabulary/structures.  The recordings are excellent quality and add many words to your vocabulary.  It is more enjoyable than the other methods I have tried.  One thing that I would like to know though is if anybody can actually keep up the pace of one per day and remember it.  I could not and I knew quite a bit of Russian at the start.  I only bring this up because I want others not to get discouraged if they can't keep that pace.  I could not.  It took me 9 months to get through it to a point where I can play any of the units and feel like I KNEW 90% or so of it.  Keep at it, it will come.  I tried many techniques including the multipass unit described in other reviews (probably from polyglot Conner) it helped but I did not completely get it.  At around unit 80 I found a mthod that worked for me and greatly picked up my assimilation.<br />1) Listen to the recording and read the text so you know the words and the helpful hints<br />2)  Import the lesson into Audacity (free)<br />3) Go thru each Lesson as<br />  a) Isolate a sentence in Audacity and loop play it<br />  b) Type the english sentence in and paste  it in a track under the isolated portion in Audacity (while listening)<br />  c) While still listening to the looped sentence go to Google translate (or something else with Cyrillic keyboard) and type it in in Russian, WHILE LISTENING.  This seemed to make me REALLY concentrate on the spelling and word separation.<br />  d)  When the sentence is completely typed in correctly (looking at book) take it and paste it on a second track,<br /><br />When you are done, you will have a recording in Audacity that plays the unit.  Above the recording for each sentence will be an English track directly above (or below) a Russian track that follows the recording.  This worked for me.  It would take about 2 or 3 hours or so per unit but I absolutely remembered them better than I did using other methods even though I had listened to some earlier units even hundreds of times.  I think that listening to the looping sentence to get the spelling down forced me to concentrate more."
136,5,"A fine book. Many suppositions by the author, but it makes for a good story."
137,3,"Teri Wilson’s Unmasking Juliet is a fun, romantic book, fun for an afternoon of rainy day reading when one wants to revisit a retelling of classic Shakespeare, modern style.<br /><br />Why is Shakespeare so popular today, as he was in the 16th century?  Because all of his popular plays have universal themes.  Hamlet involves death, betrayal and moving on, Macbeth a misuse of power, and Romeo and Juliet a theme common for teenagers of any day and age-parental disapproval of a boy they don’t like, or girl they don’t like because of their background.  Add to that family rivalry, pretty scenery, and fun parties with lots of neat food and you have this retelling by Teri Wilson.  Main character Juliet and her family own a chocolate shop Arabellas.  Due to bad blood caused by Grandma Mezzanotte selling the shared recipe in the shop once owned by both the Arabellas and Mezzanottes, and pocketing all of the cash; the families do not speak and have rival chocolate shops across the street from one another.  Enter heir to the Mezzanotte fortune Leonardo.  When they meet, masked at a party, there is an instant connection.  But, their families hate one another and conspire against them. As you read this you will find yourself asking questions such as: Do Leo and Juliet become a constant couple?  Will Juliet’s dog be saved? Will Leo discuss his ‘disability’ in relation to making chocolates? And why, why does the author not include any chocolate recipes with this book, as you will be so hungry for them after you finish reading this?<br /><br />Again, this was a fun, quick read.  Wilson has a descriptive writing style, and the prose flows well.  At times the plot lags, and for a romance there is very little sexual activity (but there wasn’t in the original Romeo and Juliet either) but there is real chemistry between Leo and Juliet.  I’m also very glad the author did not name the main male character Romeo, Leo is a much better fit for this day and time.  The rivalry between families over a lousy business deal is very current, as also the idea that they own rival chocolate shops (in reality I don’t know what the Capulets or the Montagues did for a living). Other reviewers have noted that some scenes seem oddly reminiscent of the original play, and I have to agree with that.  You will get very hungry when reading this, and will wish for hot chocolate and truffles-the actual ingredients and products sound so fun you do wish the author had at least included a web link for some recipes."
138,2,It's was a pretty book but it is over sized and had hard pages. Not at all what I was expecting it to be.
139,5,"I loved it.  APOILER ALERT: Course, I'm a sucker for happy endings."
140,5,This is a wondeful book. Any serious Yoga practitioner MUST read it.

142,4,"If you are seeking fairly simple homework assignments for someone who has quite limited Spanish background this is a fine book.  But in our case our son was returning to Spanish after some time off and we were seeking out a simple yet effective workbook to help him to refresh his memory as we started up homeschooling Spanish with a tutor.  She quickly moved us away from this book and towards other books that were more comprehensive for the price.  Avencemos, student edition was more expensive but ended up to be a better overall book because it combines instruction and numerous practice materials.  I gave the book 4 stars because it is well laid out and the sequencing of terms and concepts closely tracks the way that Spanish is taught in most middle and high schools.  But, this received little usage."
143,5,Lysa TerKeurst is one of my favorite authors. Her insights are shared and written as though we are sitting and enjoying tea together as old friends.  This is one of those devotionals that I like to read over and over again.\

147,5,"Wonderful book! Leiter argues that there's no reason to think religious claims of conscience should be given preferential treatment to secular claims of conscience. Each type should be given the same amount of scrutiny and accommodation. Tightly argued and well-written, if you have any interest in religion and society, Leiter's book is a wonderful place to begin.<br /><br />Russell Blackford's &#34;Freedom of Religion and the Secular State&#34; is a wonderful book that would nicely accompany Leiter's."
148,1,I read this book on recommendation and felt like I was reading High School essays from social misfits.
149,5,"Whether you are in the middle of a battle, coming out of one, or already a Warrior Chick, this book is for you!  Every woman should have a copy to read and keep as the Go To source for empowerment. Full of personal testimonies as well as examples from women of history, Holly shares how that we are not alone in our war and that many strong women, through the strength from the Lord, have gone on before us.  She reminds us that we are not called to be soldiers but warriors.  Warriors are in the battle, and that is where God desires us to be.<br /><br />Holly calls us to be empowered overcomers.  My favorite story is of Harmony, an abused, broken, used woman whom God raised up to be a minister in their congregation.  Holly also shares her personal fight with breast cancer, and how God gave her wisdom to realize that as God's children, we have already won.  All we need to do is claim the victory as winners!<br /><br />I encourage every woman to buy a copy of this powerful book.  It will change the way you view your personal battles.  Some books I review and pass on.  This text I am hanging onto, and keeping it in a handy spot where I can reach for it during those times I need encouragement to continue the fight.  Because of the study guide located in the back of the book, this book could be used as a personal or group study text.  Any woman's ministry, small group Bible study, or an outreach to women would benefit to use this book as a tool to minister and reach women for Christ.  Remember, we are wearing spiritual pink boxing gloves, and are rising Warrior Chicks!"
150,5,"It is amazing to read that what goes around comes around.  Meaning, that there really isn't anything new under the sun.  Jonathan does a good job of highlighting technology that existed before and is finally being discovered again today.  Very good read."
151,5,Couldn't put this book down! I cried and laughed and cried some more. Would love to see this in a movie format! I have recommended and purchased for others. Thank you so much for this beautifully written story!
152,5,Amazing thriller. This book received such rave reviews that I ordered it even though I'm not much into fishing. And I'm so incredibly glad I did.  I couldn't put it down and can hardly wait for the next two books to come out. Great character development. Superbly written. I highly recommend this book and can't wait to see what else he'll come out with in the future. And now I know what to buy my father for his Father's Day present.
153,5,"I enjoyed the discussion of how people retrieve their thoughts and emotions from their past experiences, both good and bad, and how it's an opportunity for them to bring clarity and resolution to the past.  They can also bring to bear resources they've gained (wisdom, confidence, knowledge, etc.) and compare how they would deal with those experiences having these new resources.  Beyond leaving a legacy for others to consider and learn from, I believe LegacyLine opens the way for many to heal themselves of past pains or, at least, to expose those pains and clear the way to deal with them."
154,5,"What a great book.  Ranks up there with Polya in terms of real world value and insight.  If you're in a technical field, read this.  Everyone will learn something."
155,5,This book just got better and pacier as the story unfolds.  I loved it.  Sally and Lou are great characters - I have no idea how they thought up this plot - unnervingly feels true and happening. Waiting for the next in the series.  I have a bad feeling for one of the characters but I hope I'm wrong - he'd be difficult to replace.  Not my usual type of book but now hooked.  Understand why this has won awards and recommend it to anyone.
156,5,I have enjoyed the book. I am glad I bought it.
157,5,"Very helpful for teaching history, art, science and mathematicians."

163,3,Not very impressed.My main interest is the nuts and bolts of making tanks and the few pics were badly reproduced and not clear.Did find some of the operational details nice to know.Still room for a book aimed at gearheads.

165,5,"This is just an amazing book, especially for anyone who is questioning their gender. Kate Bornstein is just plain brilliant and has inspired me to seek the same gender outlaw status that she claims. If I was a professor of a sociology or psychology of gender class, this would honestly be one of the books I had on the syllabus, it's that good. It makes you question everything about gender, and I do mean everything, even the very foundation of the binary system we have assumed for so long.<br />Whether you are questioning your gender or not, there is a lot offered by this book."
166,5,Excellent resource

If you're closed-minded or looking to soothe your assumptions, it may or may not be for you.  The author addresses the religious and historical reader with his interpretation of his research.  It's a MUST have for any student of antiquity or biblical topics..."

174,5,"Set in California's Gold Rush country in 1866, FAMILY OF HER DREAMS is a delightful, heart-warming tale that I didn't want to end. Tess Grimsby is a caregiver to two young children and housekeeper for their widowed father, Spencer Abbott. Author Keli Gwyn did an excellent job making these characters come alive in this story, and it was easy to feel I was actually there observing the people and events. Since I enjoy reading historical romance, I was very pleased to read a book with the perfect blend of believable characters, action, and romance. I highly recommend FAMILY OF HER DREAMS and look forward to reading many more books by Author Keli Gwyn. FIVE STARS!!"

177,4,"Probably more like 4.5 stars, actually.<br /><br />Macy is starting off the summer on the perfect path she's been on since a tragedy involving her father. Her brainy, extremely well-organized boyfriend is off to Brainiac Camp and she's taking over his job at the library just as her mother launches a new townhouse complex.<br /><br />Only, the other two brainiac girls the library snub her. And it's boring. And her mother is stressed out all the time, and Macy realizes that it's much, much more fun helping a caterer her mother hired for a party deal with catastrophes and disasters on jobs than her own life.<br /><br />So she falls in the with the caterer, and the caterer's crew who are a charming mix of cool characters. Don'teven get me started on Monotone (who answers in mono syllables) or boy-crazy Kristy, or uber-nerdy Bert.<br /><br />And of course, there's Wes. He's everything a younger YA teen crush should be: a reformed bad boy, artist, and nice guy (my only quibble with this book is that Wes is really too-gentlemanly and not broken enough).<br /><br />So Macy and Wes end up playing a game of Truth all summer together (like truth or dare without the daring) and Macy begins to discover truths about herself as well as the fact that people won't reject her for telling the truth about her own feelings.<br /><br />This is a quiet, plot-light book with lots of the action summarized, but alot of Macy's feelings and thoughts expertly woven into a lovely book about realizing you don't have to be what others want all the time, and that life has potholes, and that the way to survive the potholes is moving forward.<br /><br />The romance is younger-YA friendly (only kissing) and the characters expertly developed such that I wish there was a book about each one of the catering crew!"
178,2,Has a few good recipes but overall a would not agree with &#34;quick and easy&#34;. I don't plan on stacking up and breaking the bank to get the items in this book.

This book is well structured and grouped by related topics, but essentially it is just a set of stories and advices on operating production systems, and creating code that is supposed to run in the production. I'd like to name two &#34;main&#34; topics that you're going to read about: common programming practices and non-programming part - dealing with the live production systems.<br /><br />Common programming practices include a rich variety of things like: Dealing with timeouts, capturing and understanding thread dumps, working with networks, understanding and tuning garbage collection, configuring proper logging, or understanding ORMs and related issues.<br /><br />Dealing with the live production systems will discuss topics like: Embracing &#34;fail fast&#34; approach, understanding and dealing with SLAs, scaling of systems, performance monitoring, load balancing, designing configurable systems and so on.<br /><br />Even though that &#34;Release It!&#34; is ~8 years old (as of this review), time didn't hurt it much. Yes, yes - we don't need to deal with RMIs and CORBas and old EJBs and manual synchronisation so often in &#34;enterprise programming&#34; today (thanks to the rich variety of mature enterprise frameworks) - but it's a no big deal. I still felt thatthis book was very relevant even today in the world of clouds, and MEANs and microservices and other buzzwords. I'm pretty sure that its message is going to last here for quite a while.<br /><br />&#34;Release It!&#34; is the &#34;Clean Code&#34; of production systems. Somebody's already been there. Take this shortcut and learn how to make your life after the release easier. Avoid mistakes, learn from the best. It's been a wonderful read."
180,5,I gave this special book to all of the new mom's in my family. They loved it...it made them cry.
181,5,I first bought the audio book and was spellbound for two hours.  Then I decided to purchase the book to put in my collection.  For me; this may well be the most valuable and important work in my collection.

183,5,"Great book in which she showed how Hospice work is important and fruitful for helping people to die peacefully and altogether experiencing the heavenly world. This book is her collection of experiences. Next her book &#34;More&#34; was not only her experiences but also including other hospice workers' experiences. Both are very good.<br /><br />Usually I thought of being teacher or scholar as profession was good since we could contact young spirit always.<br />But after reading this book, and studying on Afterlife, I came to view of caring dying people might be most important calling. And since I became so familiar with dying and afterlife study, I might volunteer as hospice if possible. Of course, it is fairy tale since I am now old person ready to die any time. But this book changed my view on Hospice work and how it is important to the aging world and dying patients.<br /><br />Easy to read - in one sitting. Comforting book of showing existence of other heavenly world."
184,5,Very good book.
185,5,Great book on grammar!
186,5,"One of my most favorite books. I have a tattoo from it, and so feel the need to re-read it soon; I want to consolidate into my spirituality."
187,5,"This is a really comprehensive and beautiful book. You can't tell in the picture but it's really substantial and has a beautiful, shiny, padded cover. My husband is an amateur stargazer and I gave him this for Christmas. It was a huge hit."
188,4,interesting
189,5,The book was brand new and in great condition!
190,5,Without a doubt my favorite Christian fiction book ever
191,1,"Biased, superficial and inaccurate. Infrequently and innaccurately references original Islamic sources. Completely lacking in any understanding of the Islamic Sciences.<br /><br />If you want to learn about Islamic Law, go to the original sources and Islamic scholars. You wouldnt learn about a medical treatment from anyone other than a Doctor. Academic experts are there for a reason...use them. Better yet, go to your local mosque or talk to one of the many Muslims you see around... either could point you in a better direction for full and accurate information."
192,5,this was such a good book. i loved the charecters. i loved the mystery. i loved that the main female charecters aunt killed a guy who would of raped the girl when she was a kid.its a very complex story.
193,5,Thank you the perfect delivery and product was just what I needed
194,4,"The history was better than I expected, but the pictures were not as good. I loved the wry humor, but would have liked it to show up more."
195,4,Easy to read and gives a woman point of view
196,5,"Sebastian is a small mouse who is one day left in charge of his brothers and sisters while his parents go into Homesville. While they were all born on the same day, Sebastian was the eldest of them all.<br /><br />Sebastian has always wanted to go into Homesville, but knows that he is too little to go. However he does feel very proud to be considered big enough to babysit his brothers and sisters. He is careful to count them and make sure they are all there. That is, until his sister Frida turns up missing.<br /><br />I thought Sebastian was a brave little mouse to go after his sister even though he was very fearful about going into such a big place. He was very resourceful in his thinking about how to save her. He was also thoughtful about what to do in regards to keeping his brothers and sisters safe at home while he went looking for Frida.<br /><br />It was obvious to me that Sebastian’s parents made a good choice to put Sebastian in charge rather than one of the other mice as he was able to round them all up again before their parents got home. I imagine they will have quite a tale to tell when they all wake up.<br /><br />I thought this was a wonderful first chapter book story about small animals in a big world. Children will love having this book read to them or enjoy reading it as one of their first chapter books. I gave The Small Mice of Homesville 5 stars out of 5.<br /><br />I purchased this book on Amazon.ca in order to review it.<br /><br />To see my complete review, visit Shelf Full of Books http://kathrynsshelffullofbooks.blogspot.com/2015/05/book-review-small-mice-of-homesville.html"
197,2,"Maybe I've simply read too much about A.E. over the years and don't really appreciate the purpose of the 'Jewish lives' series.  At any rate, Steven Gimbel seems to skip through a selection of episodes throughout Einstein's life and the tone struck me as one of diminution.  Problems in school, problems at home, problems with the theories, & problems politically.  Not an introduction to the great man I could recommend to either a young person (as might be suggested by its brevity) or an adult.  I would advise teens and adults to read a bit more and go with Isaacson's newish study or Clark's older one.  Young readers should avoid this short book entirely."
198,3,"The painful fact that is clear after two Anne Hillerman Chee books is that she has no idea how to write a mystery. That's a huge step away from what made Tony Hillerman's classic series so satisfying. Rock with Wings is essentially a travelogue with a couple of dead bodies. Most of the &#34;mysteries&#34; misfire; one is &#34;solved&#34; by having a secondary character spout a half-page hypothesis as to what happened. The first bit of real action is delayed by 200 pages of Navajo this and Monument Valley that. For all the emphasis on Bernie Manuelito, she comes across as painfully less competent than she was when Tony introduced her, and there's nothing especially engaging about having Joe Leaphorn spend the entire novel unable to speak while recovering from a head wound. A seemingly major plot thread gets lost and unfinished without developing enough to create anticipation of a new book.<br /><br />I want to like these books, and I'm sure her readers include people who are more interested in second-hand Navajo lore than entertaining mysteries. But the fact is, Hillerman's insights into Navajo culture are not enough to sustain a novel; she's not Navajo, and she steps way over the polite line of Tony's careful respect for Navajo otherness. I'll probably buy the next one, but I'll be reading with an eye to last straws."
199,5,The book was classified as used however it looked brand new!
200,5,"Let the congregation say, &#34;Amen.&#34;"
201,5,"It's been a while since I cried while reading a book. This one did it. The anguish of not being able to save our children after we have damaged them, the pain of not being able to take away their pain. I have an 18 year old son who also has trouble with intimacy and connection with the world. The protagonist's thoughts were totally believable to me. Young men look like adults but they are so terribly vulnerable. The pressure for boys to be tough (wolves vs sheep per Daniel) is unfair to them."
202,5,"“Boxing has by far the richest tradition in American sports writing, and Springs Toledo proudly carries on this tradition with, yes, some of the most literate and memorable prose ever penned on the sweet science.  There’s something very special to fight aficionados about vivid recreations of long ago bouts involving ring legends and for which no footage was taken or has survived, and Springs is one of the best when it comes to this sub genre.  In “Gods of War” his resurrection of the Greb, Norfolk rivalry is worth the price of admission alone. And I have to agree with him that in terms of ledger if not in a perceived pound-for-pound sense Greb is the greatest fighter ever. “Gods of War” is a must for any fan of great sports writing!”"
203,5,Awesome reading
204,5,very  good reading for the holidays
205,5,"This book is  filled with 31 stunning, bordered , illustrations , creatively showcasing elegant Peacocks as the focal point in each, some images are of a single  Peacock with  graceful, detailed , spectacular,  tails,  other images include several Peacocks.  The backgrounds and sometimes the foregrounds include entangled, flowers, leaves, vines, and trees, or just a few strategically placed detailed, beautiful flowers in full bloom.<br /><br />Once you bring life to these images, with the combination of color and your own unique creative style, they will be worthy of framing.<br /><br />A perfect gift for college students, adults, some school aged children that love more detailed pictures and birds but especially Peacocks!<br /><br />1. 31 Illustrations printed one per page (the back of each page is blank) on heavy weight, bright white, perforated paper for easy page removal.<br /><br />2. All markers and some Gel pens leak through this paper, place two pages of scrap paper under the page you are coloring to prevent damaging the page under it.<br /><br />3. Full page, very detailed, bordered illustrations fill this book, the art work is flowing and the art style varies throughout the book.<br /><br />4. This book is perfect for Colored pencils or Markers:  Gel pens or crayons could be used but some details are a bit small for crayons and some areas a bit large for Gel pens.<br /><br />5. The details in the images are complete, you won’t start coloring a detail and suddenly it disappears and you are not sure what to do next.<br /><br />Tips:<br /><br />1. Outline flowers, leaves, larger areas in your illustration with a color a shade darker than the one you use to color them with, and even the edges of the flowers.<br /><br />2. If it is hard for you to distinguish your colors at night or in low light areas in your house when you try to color, purchase a Day Light bulb, this is a type of bulb that provides a brighter light and mimics daylight and colors are true."
206,5,This is the most powerful book I have ever read.
207,5,This is one of my very favorite books.
208,4,Good story but a very sad ending.
209,5,"Good book, nicely done!"
210,2,"Advertised as aligned with Common Core State Standards.  Umm...NO.  Some stuff is okay, but CCSS wasn't even a twinkle it it's daddy's eye when this resource was published."
211,5,OK.
212,5,Excellent reference source.
213,3,"Thanks to Gallery Books via Netgalley for the free review copy in exchange for my honest opinion.<br /><br />Did I like this book?<br /><br />While this book did raise many questions for me, mostly of the what-would-I-do-in-her-situation variety, I can't help but feel that &#34;Before I Go&#34; didn't live up to its potential.  The writing felt forced to me, with too many overly flowery descriptions, similes and metaphors.  I was sometimes bored, especially by Daisy's focus on the minutiae.  Many times I wanted to shake her and yell, &#34;You're dying of cancer, woman, do you really want to obsess about caulking the GD windows?&#34;<br /><br />It was difficult to connect with Daisy, and even more difficult to connect with Jack, seeing as they don't communicate a whole lot.  In fact, Jack spends a big chunk of the book at work, and while he expresses the need to spend time with Daisy, she ends up pushing him away.  It was quite an odd dynamic, and frustrated me to no end.<br /><br />Will you like this book?<br /><br />I think if you are expecting something amazing, like an epic romance to outlast the ages, you might be setting the bar too high and will inevitably end up disappointed, like I was.<br /><br />Will I read more by this author?<br /><br />Part of my problem with this book was the writing style, so at this point I would have to say I will probably steer clear of other titles by this author."
214,5,"Awesome book.<br />Lots of very obscure photos and explanations of the different manufacturers and timeline of the genre.<br />If you're into target forms and old time shooting gallery information, this book is a must."
215,5,"This book gave me exactly what I was looking for. Some of the other Alberta travel guides I reviewed focused more on the history, flora and fauna of Alberta. And, I didn't want an entire guide on the country of Canada, just the province of Alberta. I just wanted a guide to provide me with different sights to check out, hotel and food recommendations and this is exactly what I got. This guide met my expectations and I gladly recommend it."
216,5,"If you have the wear-with-all to work with mosaics, this is the text to get.<br />The patterns are intricate, but Barbara Walker makes it easy to understand<br />how to complete them.  If one is working a long piece, it does take patience<br />to continue however."
217,1,"This is a great book; not only because it gives an intimate look at Abraham Lincoln but also the times in which he lived. And, plus it has plenty of recipes from that time but with today's ingredients and quantities!"
218,5,Barn Dance is one of our very favorite read-alouds!
219,4,"Well done story, good characterization ."
220,5,This book is about my hometown and is a real gem. Love it.
221,5,"The way that he balanced military examples with other vignettes was very powerful.  It made me think about leadership in new ways that I can apply in my role.  While some of the challenges that he presented are daunting because our environment is changing so fast, the solutions that he provides are motivating and empowering.  Important read for all leaders today."
222,4,Great book.
223,5,Perfect condition!
224,4,wish a CD came along with it.
225,5,This is a wonderful story and so uniquely animated.  My grandchildren love to play this over and over again.  It is also helping them to read.  This author is very clever and it makes a great gift for children.
226,5,"Sara's life is torn apart at the age of seven with the death of her father. Having spent the following ten years with her uncle Sara's life still is not what anyone would call ordinary. Sure, she goes to high school, has a few friends and enemys but how many high schoolers have troll friends, a secret ability to heal or have a working knowledge of the world outside of the human world? As Sara tries to unravel the mystery of her father's death she begins to also unravel who...and what, she really is.<br />Her world is a lot bigger than she ever imagined.<br />This was a great book!"
227,5,Excellent
228,5,Adorable book! A pleasure to read!!! Yes yes yes this book is a must!
229,5,Bought for son who says it was great.
230,5,Loved a lot of the recipes and they were pretty simple to make.
231,4,"Good instruction, doesn't contradict but compliments the 4 other dog training books we bought."
232,5,"This book is not merely advice but amazingly-told, down-to-earth honest exposed stories of a mom doing her best in this life. Heartwarming, hilarious, God-centered and people-real. I could read this book every day of the week!"
233,5,My husband is spending a month in Montana in August - for the sole purpose of fly fishing.  This is book will be his perfect companion!
234,5,This was a wonderful book. An easy read for i have children with reading dissabilities and they where able to read with very little help. They also asked questions why they had to leave their homes and etc. boys have read several times
235,4,"&#34;A tar baby for temptation...&#34;  That line by the very fine and talented Rick Bragg, sums up Jerry Lee Lewis' life and this tale told in this book.  But it is much more than a story of Jerry Lee Lewis. It is a story of the beginnings of Rock and Roll.  &#34;Everybody who was anybody&#34; is within these pages and it makes for as very fascinating, interesting  and entertaining read.  Jerry Lee, as we Southerners are wont to say, was haunted by Jesus. So was his cousin Jimmy Swaggart and so was Elvis...All Southern artists and writers seem to be haunted by the specter of Jesus. How they respond to that specter is what makes them interesting and, perhaps, talented.  In reading and thinking about Jerry Lee Lewis, &#34;the Killer,&#34; a Biblical quotation and Shakespeare's Falstaff come to mind: &#34;The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak...&#34;  And, as Shakespeare adds, &#34;there is so much flesh...&#34;  Falstaff had more flesh than Jerry Lee did, but nobody got more out of his flesh than the Killer did,  Is that bad?  Is that good?  Is it stupid and fool hearty or just living life to its fullest?  And where does Jesus figure into all of this...  Jerry Lee says he saved souls through his music...  That ought to be enough to get you to read this very fine book. Especially if you rocked..Or rolled..."
236,5,Gives me plenty of ideas for my dehydrator!
237,5,"Wow....Jessica Wren took it there. This is so entertaining. True the author had a lot of characters but the drama and the stories of each character will keep you interested. This is far from your normal drama filled story. You will see pain, drama, lies, secrets, sex, love and war...so much more. I can't wait for part 2. I don't want to spoil it but just know blood don't mean nothing. Excellent book"
238,5,Fabulous recipes and the stories about Sea Shepherd made it even better.
239,5,Great book!
240,4,"The Most Successful Failure in the World tells the story of one businessman’s decision to change how he spent his last days. Alex Moss is a successful businessman of one of the largest marketing firms. Alex has had a wonderful lifestyle but realizes that it caused him to alienate his family. Alex is told by his physician that he has about six months to live due to an illness. After hearing the news Alex decides to make his last days count for something.<br /><br />Alex asks his employee, Peter, who happens to also be a close friend to help him research and learn from smaller companies. Alex wanted to see how their companies ran in order to improve his own company Moss Global. Alex could see how the company was affecting his daughter and Peter and didn’t want them to make the same mistakes by following in his footsteps.<br /><br />The Most Successful Failure in the World has fourteen parts that tells Alex’s story but also provides readers with the tools and tips to build a successful business while still having a meaningful life. This book had a touching story to it but was also very informative. I recommend this book to others.<br /><br />This book was provided by the author for review purposes only.<br /><br />Teresa Beasley<br />A&RBC Reviews<br />4 Stars=Great Page Turner"
241,5,This is a great resource. A fun book to keep in your clinic waiting room and share with parents and children alike. People who write that this is some form of indoctrination for children into quackery have not taken their time to research the scientifically established benefits of Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture. The national institute for health and the world health organization have great resource pages for you to review the research. However if you are not trained in research you have no business sharing your uneducated opinions on research.
242,1,"author has a doctorate in philosophy - and spins science like any creationist would.<br /><br />Gluten sensitivity is an important issue as our population grows older and fatter,<br />so you don't have to be the few with celiac disease to feel better avoiding Gluten.<br />low/no gluten products serve the Paleo and Keto dieters as well, so even when<br />the fad aspect Dr Alan dwells upon dies down, the product demand continues.<br /><br />Dr Alan chronicles the fad, but does not go back a few more decades when the<br />convergence of over population concerns, advances in grain farming techniques<br />and commercial animal protein production all conspired to create far more grain<br />than humans could consume - so farmers and madison ave got us eating it up.<br /><br />eating gluten rich foods is the real new &#34;fad&#34;<br />as humans have mostly avoided them for millions of their evolutionary years,<br />just ask any REAL scientist, not some pretender with a doctorate in ethics."

244,5,great
245,5,My son loves these books
246,5,I have been a henry miller fan for decades ... thank you Simone Beauvoir for introducing Violette ... she is off the charts ... absolutely phenomenal writer!!!!  She stands unembarrassed along side Joyce and Miller ... how is it possible that she is practically unknown !!!!!!!!
247,5,Now I have the Greek and Hebrew too
248,5,Awesome book!<br />Arrived before expected- and in great shape!<br />Thank you so much!
249,5,I love this book. For me personally it made me view my business and skills in a completely different way. I'm glad I made the purchase and will continue to read in hope to grow blackroseaffair.com
250,5,This is a fantastic book that made both a fan of Theodore Roosevelt and David McMullough. I bought this copy to give as a gift to help another young person become enamored with the dynamic Theodore.
251,5,Great little book; a fun read.  Shipped on time and packed well.
252,5,"Perfect.  My wife and used this guide on our first trip to Paris.  While I think the restaurant guides could have included more selections, the entire book was well written and served as a great guide in our case.  Thanks, Rick."
253,5,Thought provoking with interesting ideas expressed very well. A must read for all artists seeking an individual path with integrity.
254,5,Excellent study guide. The questions make you think and allows the text to speak for itself. Great insights and helps in back. InterVarsity Press continues to publish the best inductive study guides out there.
255,5,Awesome.
256,5,Exactly what I was looking for! Nothing fake about it. Great book to help you understand what Heathenry is.
257,3,"Bourdain loves to be a bad boy--and is extremely experienced at that and at high-octane cooking. In this book, he is a far cry from the lackadaisical food tourist he plays on the Travel Channel and now CNN. always kind of seeming hungover and never quite fitting in. I also really liked the book SOUS CHEF--which is along the same lines. But I think this book set the standard."
258,5,Awesome retro interior decorating book. Fun to read!
259,5,An Excellent book for understanding and applying practical agorism.  I confidently recommend this work to anyone who is interested in utilizing agora in every day living. Impressive read.
260,5,Love the book.  Excellent insight from Tim Lahaye & Ed Hindson.
261,5,Great insights on the differences between how dogs & humans communicate.  Very enlightening information to better communicate with our dogs.
262,5,"I did not want to put the book down from the moment I started reading it.  I appreciate the author made every aspect of the story as believable as possible by drawing on today's technology and the possibilities in the near future.  His references to the music and the TV shows of the 1970's were funny and complimented  the character's personality, especially when considering the stress the character was under at the time.  This book was recommended to me and I will certainly pass that favor on to my family and friends."
263,5,"I loved this book; I didn't want to read it. I saw it in my local library, and being an engineer and patent attorney, I checked it out, feeling a sort of professional obligation. I took it home. A couple of weeks later, as it was coming due, I was about to return it with the covers uncracked, but first, out of curiosity, I checked the index, remembering that the Iowa State Highway Commission is in Ames, where I went to college. I wondered whether Iowa State was mentioned. Sure enough, there were several references, and I turned to those pages and learned the fascinating story of how the legendary professor Anson Marston tasked two students to go out and conduct studies with farmers and horse-drawn wagons on the poor roads of rural Iowa. One of those students, Thomas Harris MacDonald, went on to become the most powerful highway administrator in America, reporting to several Presidents, and finally arousing the jealousy of no less a man than Franklin D. Roosevelt. That work changed America and the world in very powerful ways. There's more than a tale of engineering here. It's also a tale of history and sociology."
264,1,The book I received was not the same as shown
265,5,Interesting read
266,4,"Antenna installation and distribution system design are still very much relevant to consumers or professionals looking to install digital TV antennas today. Yet there are precious few books that really examine those subjects in-depth.<br /><br />This book was written by a Satellite/Antenna/MATV business owner in the 1980s as a kind of &#34;for dummies&#34; guide to others looking to get into the business. As such, half the book deals with C-Band (big dish) installation. There's also a chapter dedicated to business considerations. The other half of the book deals with theory and practice of antenna installation and signal distribution systems - a lot of which is very relevant to installing digital antenna systems today.<br /><br />The other two resources I'd highly recommend are Improving TV Signal Reception by Dick Glass and the Erecting an Antenna page on HDTVPrimer dot com. I'd particularly recommend reading the web page, as it deals with some issues unique to DTV reception."
267,5,I love this book!  I have listened to it on audible several times now and every time I do I add to my inspiration.  Perfect book for everyone but especially someone who wants or is making a transition in their life
268,5,"Well organised ,and gives inspiration for using the beautiful sock yarns now available. Instructions clear. A pleasure to use."
269,5,"I bougfht this for a friend who sells bags on e-bay.  She tells me she learned helpful and interesting things from it.  She likes it very much, so I believe I made a wise purchase in getting this for her.."
270,5,"Concise, to the point. Great short book for brainstorming."
271,4,"This is great for the study of our development, this covers the theories of how we become what we will, there are so many ideas that are discussed here, it is a required text book for my classes, but this is also good read."
272,5,Amazing story.Could not put it down.Read it in one sitting.Very inspiring story.
273,5,"I've only tried a couple of other method books, but I love this one.  The lesson are well directed toward accomplishing given tasks and I love playing along with my backup band on the CD."
274,5,This book is absolutely fabulous. Outstanding. I loved all of it.
275,5,A fantastic book on the history of philadelphia...Purchased it for a frien ....and he really<br />appreciated it.  Thanks... Ra'sheeda Bey
276,5,Thank you!
277,5,"A great read! As a police officer, I found this book to be extremely accurate regarding the occurrences that are exhibited on a daily basis. The insight that is portrayed from a street perspective as well as the legal perspective made this book hard to put down."
278,5,good
279,4,good story.
280,5,Very good book. Pictures well printed.
281,1,Why is this about the drugs and medicine but isn't about the great Mao's teachings??!!!!
282,2,"Sam Kean has a lot he wants to say. In trying to do so, too much information is crammed into too small a space and nothing is retained."
283,4,Derived as promised in good condition
284,5,"I love this book! My 4 year old son is a fan of Pele and while he cannot read this on his own, we enjoyed reading this book together from start to finish. I was also impressed by the illustrations.  Very nicely done."
285,5,I have well over a thousand books of various kinds. I grew up with the whole earth catalog in my house.  This is the coolest book I've grabbed in ages. Unmatched for reference in variety and layout I can't sing enough praises about this book. And cheaper than I would expect for such a resource. It's a how to book about everything. If it doesn't show you how it tells you where to find out how to. Everyone I've shiwed it to has said they had to get it and for the price a must have.
286,2,"Should be called sharepoint design for your mom.<br /><br />It should be next to the books by speakers that tell companies to make sharepoint like Facebook. Um, no.<br /><br />Plays with the ootb sp master page creator and theme (ooh, I can make it purple and teal!), covers the very start of real master page design, then goes into an HTML and CSS primer. Gah. Just fizzles off into random JavaScript, jquery, bootstrap, and other buzzwords a manager might have heard once. This book is for beginners and dabblers only - the previous one was better.<br /><br />There is nothing on building a robust sharepoint branding solution, and randy drisgill's master page set on codeplex is more buggy than an ant hill. They didn't used to be so bad. Disappointing."
287,5,The recipes are as delicious as portrayed in the photos.  They are easy to make for anyone who has spent a little time in the kitchen and can be easily customized by the chef.  The sellers packaging was green and the book looked as great as described.
288,5,"If you're unfamiliar with the comic, it kind of reminds me of the Far Side (that being a good thing).  Daily calendar (Saturday and Sunday on one page).  Trivia, Sudoku, scrambled word, or some kind of little &#34;extra&#34; on the back of each page."
289,5,Great food in the book.
290,5,Good read with prompt delivery from amazon.
291,3,It's OK - has a lot of information.
292,5,It was my generation growing up with parents the age of Robin and her sibbllings. Our parent's generation suffered greatly under the great depression and then WWII. It gave me a sense of who my parents were and the culture of their generation. I loved her devotion to her husband and her children and her strong will to be independent and make things right for her family. It was heart breaking that she left her world so young. I would enjoy a sequel on the later years of Robin's life in the Convent Boarding school. I also lived in a boarding school academy. I would like to know about her father and family who survived their mother's death. Thanks Robin for sharing such personal information with a world today who could not have a clue of how the 1929- 1945 generation lived unless the 'Robins' are willling to share their personal history written down in letters. Phyllis Jean Fulton of 1942 birth.
293,5,another dynamic case book
294,4,"Since I don't play chess and know very little about the game, the metaphorical comparisons between chess and checkers as well as playing chess and leading an organization were somewhat lost on me.  Having said that, I found the book easy to read, the lessons generally clear, and the story line believable enough to hold my interest.  Mark Miller's four main points - bet on leadership, act as one, win the heart, and excel at execution - resonate with me.  I can see why there's a companion field guide and video series available at an additional cost; the book left me curious about how to go deeper and implement these concepts in real organizational and family situations.  As a leader of a small but growing organization myself, I can envision ordering copies of this book in bulk, distributing them in advance of a general meeting, and spending time going through the book as an organizational, culture-building exercise.  I think others will feel similarly."
295,2,Nothing new here.
296,1,"Very disappointed.  I am growing tired of authors realizing they've created something of value and than milking it for everything it's worth, which in my opinion, ruins it.  I feel like this story is going to turn into another Wheel of Time - post book 3, and Song of Ice and Fire.  I am getting off this ride and will not read the next installment.  This book should have been titled &#34;Daylight war part 2 - the Krasian Cycle Series.&#34;  I wish more authors were like Mark Lawrence.  His Broken Empire series was brilliant and ended perfectly after just 3 books.  He could have easily kept it going but acknowledged that the story would have suffered."
297,5,One of the best books I have ever read regarding the &#34;troubles&#34; and the Scottish connection with both Ulster Protestants and Catholics.  This book will say with me for quite a while!

308,5,These are my favorite books.  Please write another one soon. Full of fascinating information. Something for everyone
309,5,had the bunny project I wanted
310,5,"Intriguing  story, written  exceptionally well. Michael Schein completed significant research, and stitched together fascinating  fact within a masterful novel."
311,5,"I would be strongly against forcing this type of study book down the throat of some disinterested kid during summer vacation. The thought of doing anything structured or resembling schoolwork during summer vacation would have been a huge bummer to me when I was a kid.<br /><br />But if your kid likes learning, and can approach this like it was fun games and puzzles, then they need not dwell on whether this book is designed to prep them for whatever test or if it meets whatever state standards. Learning is learning, we don't have to make it political or onerous if they are oblivious to that stuff.<br /><br />I think it all depends on your child's personality, and how you have presented learning to them in the past."
312,5,"Encouragement, smiles, and best of all, a feeling that someone else understands the soul-withering difficulties of suffering an ailment that doesn't show (so many of us with fibromyalgia look just fine on the outside). Jones treats the many stumbling blocks of this disease with courage and humor--how I loved the humor and insight of her rhymes--and provides fibromyalgia sufferers a comrade in arms."
313,5,My three year old granddaughter loves this book
314,5,the best
315,5,great book for the price.thank you
316,5,better then i expected it has alot of info about sharks to teach children in a fun way! a must buy for all kids!
317,5,We've done several launches planned from this atlas. Accurate descriptions clue you in on the paddle highlights and any down sides.
318,4,"Good, but maybe a bit too simple.  Some stuff is re-written in the key of C major, when originally it was some other key.  Easy-street here.  I think this is a good starter book, but if you know anything about keyboard, you may want the next level up."
319,5,"I read this book in about 5 hours, because it was so engaging.<br /><br />I definitely got sucked in.<br /><br />Recommended!"
320,5,We love this book!
321,4,This is not the cover depiction which I received.
322,4,"Ok, a little too much previous history on some people."
323,5,"Perfect condition, this is one of my daughters favorites!"
324,3,"The Hiding Place by David J Bell.  The cover and title hooked me before I ever opened the book. The story was a bit slow and it took way too long to get to the resolution. However, I was intrigued and didn't figure out the &#34;who did it&#34; until towards the end.<br /><br />Twenty-five years ago, Janet Manning and her brother, 4 yr old Justin were playing at a nearby park.  It was the first time her mother allowed her to be in charge.  She was supposed to be watching him but when she sees  her best friend, Michael, all is forgotten in her 7 yr old mind.  Now, Justin is missing and the frantic search begins.  A few months later, Justin's body is found in a shallow grave in the nearby woods.<br /><br />It is now the 25th anniversary of Justin's murder and Janet is set to do an interview with their local paper stirring up memories of &#34;that day, in the park&#34;.<br /><br />Doesn't that sound like something you want to read?  Yeah, me too.  That said, the story is slow but intriguing.  It has plot twists you won't see coming.  These twists get you thinking about the &#34;who done it&#34; story and when you think you've guessed it. Nope, your wrong but you will guess it before the story is over.<br /><br />This is the reason behind my 3 stars.  There are also a few side stories that I felt were just fillers and not really needed but I would like to read more about Dante Rogers and his life."
325,5,"I really should give this a 4 because I'm bothered that I had to look in the back for some answers. :-) But I guess that until you can do them without having to look in the back, it's the perfect level. A little more challenging than Monday, just enough but not too much."
326,4,Glad I have it in review and guide to the movie.
327,5,I love this! I take my time and savor every page! Thank you!
328,5,great book - full of patterns to reference - fast and accurate service
329,5,Author has meticulously achieved to simply the teachings of Gita(Hindu religious teachings) and associate to 21st century management practices.<br />I am a Project Manager with MNC and I am humbled with the simplistic explanation of the texts and how it relates with our everyday work as a leader and a manager. A must read!
330,5,This is such a clever take on the alphabet book - will be enjoyed by the adult reader for sure.
331,5,"A great read, and compeling journey of the authors setting and reaching goals. To achieve goals , first you must set them and then layout a path to reach them. This book shows an excellent path that can be applied to any goal oriented endeavor. It would be especially helpful for young just getting started,or the young at heart starting out again."
332,5,This was a gift for my daughter in law and she tells me it is a great book for her two year old.
333,5,"It's the same ole self-help encouragements, but worth the read. I'm dealing with health issues and some things I just need to have the &#34;courage to let go&#34; and &#34;move on&#34;. And his reminders are a good &#34;push&#34;."
334,3,"There are a few nice patterns in this book, but mostly hats. If you want to learn fair isle and need a hat, then this book is perfect. I was a little disappointed that there weren't a better assortment of patterns, but it's still a nice book."
335,5,"Just as good as the first book. Lex Thomas is just, the bomb."
336,4,Excellent book. Enjoyed it.
337,5,"I bought this as a gift for my daughter, who loves hiking the Oregon trails.  It was perfect, though the paperback cover was not as romantic in appearance as the contents."
338,5,Great book with lots of Good advice!
339,1,NOT HAPPY!  2nd week into class only to discover this card DOES NOT WORK!  Have to return it and wait for replacement!
340,5,Great book. Easy format.

342,5,Great book
343,4,"A good look at the man that could help change our world. We are the change we need. I believe he is the real deal, therefore probably not a snowball chance in hell in being a front runner with ignorant voters and complicit media."

347,5,"Greg Iles is ALWAYS a winner. He writes amazing stories, and has yet to have one that is a loser. This one is no exception."
348,5,Good condition
349,5,I have not been able to put this book down! I cannot wait to see what happens next.  Atlas Forman is a book that is sure to keep you turning pages.
350,4,"Didn't read it all.  Stopped after WWII, but liked the bits about the abdication crisis and his life in and around WWI and his early years with Lady Diana Cooper."
351,5,"We are fans of The Vikings, and so when I saw this book, I ordered it.  There is an introduction which explains the origins of these sagas, written as one might expect present-day writing.  The Sagas are written in &#34;old style&#34;, for example, &#34;And when they came back to the town, they took all the treasure, burned every house in town, and tore down all the walls.  Then they sailed their ships away.&#34;  The writing has a sing-song feel as I read it.  The stories in the book include The Saga of Ragnar Lodbrok, Sogubrot (the story of King Ivar), List of Swedish Kings, The Tale of Ragnar's sons, and Krakumal (an epic style poem relating a battle tale).  A bibliography is also included for those who want to read more.  This isn't light reading, but it is good."
352,5,"This is the ultimate freshman level chemistry textbook.<br />Arrived early (I contacted them, said I needed it early, and I received!)<br />The challenge problems are good practice.<br />--This won't prepare you for advanced analytical chemistry problems that were on one of my exams........<br /><br />I will never forget this textbook."
353,5,This book was a page turner with twists I didn't see coming. I believe it would make a good movie
354,5,"Anyone interested in LeSS or SAFe, or Scrum@Scale, etc. should read this book.  This is NOT light reading.  It has very dense, substantial content on the level of something like Don Reinertsen's Principles of Product Development Flows.  If you're practicing some kind of agile at scale, this book would be good to read a little every day, and formulate your own model of how it could work for your organization.  This is definitely your go-to desk reference."
355,4,"Interesting read, needs more research."
356,5,"In their book Drs. Weisinger and Pawliw-Fry provide 22 success strategies that comprise of the latest research on neuroscience and from the experiences of over 12,000 employees at Fortune 500 companies. The goal of the book is to help you reduce pressure in your personal life and overcome diminishing performance in your professional life. The book is structured into three different sections and each section makes a contribution to the reader and gives strategies and techniques that are highly accessible. You can read the book in any order you prefer.<br /><br />For your convenience, I had Hendrie Weisinger on my podcast, The Entrepreneurs Library, to give a deep dive on Performing Under Pressure. With Hendrie’s experience he gives amazing insight on how to perform at your highest abilities while tackling stress. If you would like to hear a real review from the author himself check out episode 180 at theELpodcast[dot]com/books or you can find the show on iTunes."
357,5,I read the Los Angeles Diaries: Memoir for my English class and I enjoyed every part of it. The author focuses on emotions and thoughts when reading. I also found it very heart breaking but inspirational. I think the author did an amazing job and I would recommend it to everyone.
358,5,"MY THOUGHTS ON THIS BOOK<br /><br />Jeremiah and Anna May's life took a tumbling fall when Jeremiah left his Amish family, Anna May and the Amish faith for the English world, and their schools, to become a  veterinarian. But will his return mean that they can pick up where they left off with their relationship? Life is not that easy! And life for these two young people was not without heartaches and many struggles as they strived to find out what God really wanted them to do with their lives.<br /><br />I have read many of Kathleen Fuller's books, and have enjoyed them all! Just as I enjoyed this one, and I'm going to get the other books in this series as well! I fell in love with these characters immediately, and I thoroughly enjoyed following their journey, though they did have their moments. I like that Ms. Fuller shows so much detail to the story and each scene that takes place. This is truly a well written book, and a book that anyone who loves a really good Amish story will want to read!<br /><br />I received this book from BookLook Bloggers to read and review. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission’s 16 CFR, Part 55."
359,5,First time I read anything by this author. Really enjoyed the story. Definitely kept me guessing throughout the entire book. Liked how the author presented the characters.  A real page turner up to the last word!
360,4,Very informational. Easy to understand.  Worth the money.
361,5,"I do not have enough superlatives for this book. I loved every single word of it!<br /><br />This is one of my favorite types of thrillers. The tension, the unease, the outright fear are all slow-moving but steadily building. Twists and turns linger around every corner, and I was left guessing as to what really happened to the twin girls and their parents until, no kidding, the very last page.<br /><br />The author is a genius with descriptive words. I was there on that lonely island, seeing the beauty of the landscape and then the fury of the storm. I was there with the surviving twin as she struggled to make sense of her shattered world, and I was there with the parents as they each, in their own way, fought to make it just from one day to the next. The layers of grief and sadness and fear that color the book just make it that much more gripping.<br /><br />This is just a fantastic book.<br /><br />*free copy from NetGalley*"
362,5,"No surprises here - this booklet contains just what the title says it will. I ordered a used copy, but it was printed to last. The illuminations inside the booklet are done well - they are not over saturated or poor facsimiles of original images."
363,5,Great uplifting story. Anyone can read it. Great to give people that are going through a hard time. I definitely recommend this book to add to your collection or to buy for someone as a gift.
364,3,"I have now read four books about the coastwatchers: Lonely Vigil (by Walter Lord), Alone on Guadalcanal (by Martin Clemens), The Coast  Watchers (by Eric Feldt), and Coast Watching in WWII (A.B. Feur).  Coast Watching in WWII (subtitle: Operations against the Japanese on the Solomon Islands, 1941-43) sounds as though it would offer a comprehensive review of coast watching operations during those year. In fact, this book covers only the coastwatching operations on Bougainville and neighboring Buka Island.  This book is primarily the edited memories of two coastwatchers on Bougainville: Jack Read and Paul Mason. That should be interesting, but these accounts are stylistically dull by comparison with the Alone on Guadalcanal (discussed below) and Lonely Vigil, which is based on both written records and numerous interviews and recounts the same coastwatching tales on Bougainville in a more interesting fashion. In short, if one has read Lonely Vigil (which was published about 20 years before this book), he could skip reading this book and miss little or nothing.  If you would like to learn about how the coastwatcher organization aided the fight against Japan in the  South Pacific, the most comprehensive book is The Coast  Watchers. This book was written by the man who set up and managed the coastwatcher organization (codename Ferdinand) from 1939 until early 1943 (when he stepped down after suffering a heart attack), and was the first book on the coastwatchers published after WWII (the first edition coming out in 1946).  Lonely Vigil covers much but not all of the same ground as The Coast  Watchers, but goes into greater detail and is a more enjoyable read. This does not mean The Coast  Watchers was a bad read, just not as enjoyable as Lonely Vigil. This should not be surprising, since the author of Lonely Vigil (Walter Lord) is a highly accomplished author.  If you want to get a feeling for what life as a coastwatcher was really  like, Alone on Guadalcanal is the book for you, as it is a first-person account put together by a single author. The author, Martin Clemens, was a government official before the invasion by Japan, and so the book offers not only the perspective of a coastwatcher but also that of a (thoughtful) British colonial official who was trying to manage things on that end as well. As a government official,  Martin Clemens kept a diary all during his time in the Solomon Islands and so he was able to do a great job recounting his days as a coastwatcher.  Seeing that Alone on Guadalcanal was first published in 1998, one might well wonder just how much Martin Clemens could remember. In fact, as the author explains in the book's preface, the first draft of the book was written in the early 1950 but a final book never materialized because by that time there was already a great abundance of military books on the market and publishers did not have much interest in his story. It was only decades latter that a chance meeting between Martin Clemens and a US Marine veteran got the ball rolling again and eventually lead to the publication of the book by the Naval Institute Press. To make a long story short, even though the book wasn't published until 1998, the author actually did most of the writing in the early 1950s, when his memories were still relatively fresh.  I'm very glad I read three out of these four books about the coastwatchers. As explained above, I found Coast Watching in WWII was not a worthwhile read in  terms of content or style (but I read it to the end so I could be fair). In terms of good reading,  I enjoyed the first-person perspective of Alone on Guadalcanal the most. Lonely Vigil was also a compelling read."
365,4,Interesting and helpful info.
366,4,Textbook -- great deal
367,5,Great reference source. Very informative without being too technical.
368,5,I love this magazine and will be making the quilt shown.
369,3,Not bad
370,5,Great guide to what Oregon has to offer.
371,5,Product was as described.  It was sent in a timely manner.  It was appropriately packaged. I was very pleased.
372,4,"From Hell, more than any other book I can think of, tries to earn the title of 'graphic novel'. Comics rarely try to become historical fiction like this, and Moore presents a fantastically researched and wellk-written theory on the ripper murders.<br /><br />From Hell is chiefly an atmosphere book. Moore constructs a dark world that makes a point of showing the horrid living conditions of Victorian London, and the layers of conspiracy that drive the government. The horror is, well, horrible to witness, and you should be thankful depictions of Ripper victims aren't in full color. And of course, Moore's great ear for dialogue shines through, with passages you'll want to keep rereading.<br /><br />But there are a few flaws to this. For one, the artwork rarely goes beyond acceptable and can on occasion become outright bad. The lack of color makes panels that are mostly black already completely incomprehensible. And the story itself isn't above criticism. Moore makes no secret of the fact that he doesn't really believe the theory he based this story on because of how fantastic it is, and that shows. A few story turns that need to happen to fit the theory don't make a whole lot of sense, but he can't do anything to change them. Finally, a few of the story elements don't make sense until after you've read the long appendix explaining all the research that went into this book.<br /><br />All in all, I would say this is definitely not Moore's most entertaining work, but it possibly his most impressive one. It is well worth a read to any fan of comics."
373,5,excellent!  I was given this book for Christmas and it is wonderful- great for the brain.
374,4,Books
375,5,"FANTASTIC!!!  This is a true Classic!!!!  I think every school in the U.S. has this book on their mandatory reading list.  Harper Lee has done an excellent job bringing this 1930s Alabama childhood to life.  It takes you back to a time that was very different and similar from today.  To Kill a Mockingbird is a piece of our American history that depicts racism and prejudice, childhood innocence, and the perseverance of a man who risked it all to stand up for what he believed in.  If you haven't read this book than you are missing out!!!  For a classic this is a very easy book to read."
376,5,Bought this a gift for my boyfriend because he needed a larger print. He loves it!
377,1,"Since recently discovering this author's recent allegations of sexual misconduct, i cannot support him due to the double standards within his teachings. This book also seems to be poorly executed and researched compared to other meditation books i have read."
378,5,"Persona marketing has become such a fill-in-the blank catchphrase for content marketers that it's hard to know what it really is and how having one for your buyer is going to make you a better, more effective marketer. Then along comes this book from Adele Revella, the person who literally coined the phrase and now heads up the Buyer Persona Institute (www.buyerpersona.com). Just within the first chapter, she clears the fog and provides clear direction.<br /><br />I was fortunate to receive an advance copy of this book and have written a review for Huffington Post (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-fox/who-needs-buyer-personas_b_6827288.html). I was also able to interview Adele prior to the book's release and have made the full transcript and audio available here: http://venturemarketing.com/adele-revella-buyer-personas-book-interview/<br /><br />The book is a terrific how-to for creating buyer personas -- useful for marketers and sales people. I believe it will be a required text for college marketing courses."
379,5,"I first read this book in the fifth grade and instantly became obsessed with Creech's other stories. That same year I read Chasing Redbird, Walk Two Moons and Love that Dog.<br /><br />I have continued reading and rereading her books as I've gotten older and still feel like I can connect well with the characters. Whether you are buying this for yourself or a child, I would definitely recommend this book and her other ones, as well."
380,5,"Fast, and great."
381,5,Everyone needs this book in their life!
382,5,I love my journal and I use it as often as I can!
383,5,"Sometimes a Great Notion (1964), Ken Kesey's second novel, is in my opinion a much better work than the much better known One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, which has undoubtedly been helped by the success of the movie adaptation.  The story centers on the relationship between half brothers Lee and Hank Stamper, and especially the affair the somewhat older Hank had with Lee's mother while she was married to their father, which lends a kind of incestuous undertone to the proceedings even if it wasn't technically incest. Meanwhile, the Stampers face resentment from their community because they run a non-union logging operation (the employees are all members of the controlling family and not bound to the loggers union) while everyone else is suffering through a walkout.  There are conflicts galore here as Lee tries to get his revenge on Hank while the Stampers try to get on with filling a major order for lumber that would undercut the strike's effectiveness. Hank as a kind of Hairy Apish blue collar hero and the self-pitying, resentment-filled Lee are at the core, with Hank's wife Vivian as the crux of the conflict. But there are many other characters, including some local inhabitants whose movements and actions seem superfluous but offer a broader perspective on the milieu where the story takes place. Some are minor masterpieces of tangential characterization, such as the struggling, hen-pecked laundry owner who has a poignant affair with his black assistant, or the aged former whore who is now reduced to paying for sex by buying drinks.  For the most part, Kesey keeps the plot and all its threads going masterfully. He does this through a kind of multi-perspective approach that alternates first-person narration from different characters and omniscient third-person narration, jump-cutting from one to another sometimes even within sentences. This Joycean technique ranges from interesting when used sparingly to irritating when Kesey machine-guns perspective changes at thereader in rapid-fire order, sometimes multiple times in the same sentence. He does this especially in scenes of high drama, when all it does is muddle the picture. If a reader is spending more time trying to figure out the perspective changes than in appreciating the scene being described, there's a problem.  The perspective changes are signaled by the use of parentheses and alternating between standard type and italics. It doesn't help that this edition's typesetting made switches from italic to standard difficult to discern quickly. Maybe a higher quality printing job would have helped. In any case, I found this technique, when used to excess, a distracting affectation.  Fortunately, instances where Kesey runs off the rails with it are fairly rare, so I can't in all conscience reduce my five-star rating. Sometimes a Great Notion has to be one of the books in the conversation when the best American novels of the second half of the 20th century are discussed."
384,4,Good for beginners.
385,4,Is a great book for teaching about where and how to set boundaries in relationships.
386,5,A very interesting and useful book.
387,5,Love it
388,4,Good book of back issued comics. The Omnibus series is a great way to get caught up with comics no longer in print
389,5,"A masterpiece on the subject. Francois-Marie Patorni, scholar on the history of the French in New Mexico (newmexicofrenchhistory.com)."
390,5,It was just what I needed for my early kindergarten readers. Was in great shape too.
391,5,Loved it!! And I want the Hempstocks to be real people and I want to go live on their farm.
392,5,Outstanding
393,5,I bought this book for my daughter who is doing A'Levels Biology. This book was recommended by her teacher. The book has many colourful  diagrams that are easy to understand. The information and explanations are very clear and precise. There are also little tidbits in the book about biographical history and fun facts that provide further information. Overall my daughter is very happy with this book and she says that it is extremely​ helpful.
394,5,"An amazing book and a must read!  Get to know the characters, and move with them to the climax! Wonderful!"
395,5,great
396,3,"Taught third graders the section on the moon, stars, sun and planets today. It was an interesting read. However, the questions at the end of some sections are difficult and the answers are not in the book. Unless there is a special teacher edition with all the answers, it is very difficult for the kids to find the correct answer in the text with the help of a teacher. Many students were lost and confused about what was really being asked. And when I looked in the text to help them, I had trouble figuring out the answer. They could have done a better job writing this book."
397,5,This is one of the most amazing books that I have ever read.  I almost wish it came out 20 years earlier!!  Well worth it's price.  I recommend to everyone.
398,5,"Loooove this Book! This author Is amazing, i have almost all of his books."
399,1,"this book is more about superstitious magics rather than teaching how to read tarot.<br />i really do not like those number games suggested in the book. where you have to calculate your magic number with your birthday, or fortune number current year. No i do not buy this idea a number determine your life.<br /><br />worse of all - it included some black and white (not even grey scale) tarot card that look so disturbing and give me nightmare( literally) after reading it at night."
400,5,"I truly loved this book! Having also experienced a crazy youthful journey to the feet of a living Saint, I can relate to wild rides and Divine collisions! Ram Das is a great writer with a great story to tell - his honesty, humility and humor shine through each page of this book. His deep devotion to his path and to his incredible spiritual teacher is an inspiration. Whatever the nature of your journey, whatever the flavor of your path, Rising in Love will surely stimulate your mind, bring warm smiles to your heart and inspire your soul!"
401,5,"Powerful, moving, raw- an emotional journey through a family's struggle in war torn Bosnia. I finished the book in 2 days, couldn't put it down. An important read for anyone who takes their freedom for granted. I loved how the author moved from present day to the past, and included pictures and a glossary of names, found it quite helpful to get a real sense of the story. I found the concept of crossing items off his list during his trip to be interesting, but to see how the list changes as he faces his past and certain &#34;demons' from that past was even better. While most of us won't understand what Kenan and his family went through, we can all relate to the power of love, the fear of the unknown, the yearning for revenge, and the surprise of forgiveness. I highly recommend The Bosnia List, not only as a personal story, but as a quick lesson in a very recent dark part of history."
402,5,you will enjoy this book
403,5,"Snyder's Batman is continually creepy and engaging, both which are well suited for the Dark Knight."

409,4,"I loved the first volume.  I merely liked this one.  The characters, writing, pacing were fine.  The dramatic tension was missing.  The key plot turns were to my eye too pat and the end left me flat.  Part of the problem could be my age.  This is a YA novel and I was in that age bracket when JFK was President.  However I didn't have that problem with the first volume.  This one seemed far too much of a dungeon crawl with the action designed to advance from plot point A to B to C to... It does that competently enough.  I do not begrudge paying full retail for an HC.  I may even read it again someday.  But I kept thinking I'd seen this all before.  There was simply little sense of wonder or surprise for me.  YMMV."
410,3,"Ok, my 41/2 half year old found it boring"
411,5,This is a book that I enjoyed in 5th grade and I'm glad I found it again because its still just as good as I remembered. Thank you for having it and I appreciate how quickly I received it
412,2,"Abuse of a anyone is an awful sin & crime especially for a child. Although the author / victim received counseling, time with the Cardinal, and a monetary settlement he has not recovered.  It is not clear how accepting money from the Church is an act in his recovery."
413,5,Yup. That is all.
414,4,Just what I needed for class.
415,5,"“God’s Bankers,” though lengthy is only a history of Vatican money and power in modern times, starting with Napoleon’s conquest of Rome.<br /><br />The Vatican didn’t even have a bank until about 1930, when it needed one to manage an indemnity it collected from the Fascist government. In fact, until well into the 20th century, Roman Catholic doctrine condemned the charging of interest for loans, and the Vatican didn’t produce even pro forma budgets until after the Great War.<br /><br />Which is not to say that great amounts of money didn’t flow through the Vatican, but they were managed like a the policy bets at a corner candy store. And I mean that in every sense.<br /><br />Pius XI selected a skilled, prudent, unscrupulous layman, Bernardino Nogara, to manage the windfall, and he generated excellent returns, helped by using Vatican intelligence for insider trading and aided by a side business in helping Italians cheat on their taxes.<br /><br />When war came, the Vatican Bank (formally the Institute for Works of Religion) did even better by helping the Nazis and Fascists rob and murder Jews and other non-Catholics. Gerald Posner’s heavily-annotated volume is more about power than money, and his chapters 7 and 8 are the best short summation I know for the actions and inactions of Pope Pius XII and most of the Curia in furthering the Holocaust. (The professional Roman Catholic defenders will squeal at this review -- and are already squealing at Posner -- but there is no longer any real controversy about the Church’s pro-Nazi role.)<br /><br />The Vatican Bank was more like a German merchant bank or a hedge fund than a commercial bank, taking stakes in businesses and putting its nominees on their boards. It was also more like a Swiss or Luxembourgeois private bank in helping tax evaders.<br /><br />It also laundered money for mobsters and acted “like an offshore bank inside Rome” to help hide dirty money; and it was a source of or conduit for illegal political contributions to the Christian Democrats. It also conspired with rightwingers to plot overthrows of democracies in Italy, Greece and (probably) elsewhere.<br /><br />This ought to have been good business, and to an extent it was. But after the cautious Nogara retired, the bank was in the hands of amateur crooks who speculated wildly. “God’s Bankers” is frustrating on finances because the numbers are so sketchy. This is not Posner’s fault, as the Vatican was able, until 2013, to keep almost all its dealings secret.<br /><br />But it may be that the bank lost capital faster than it made dirty profits. It certainly lost a lot of capital.<br /><br />What we do know about it came out in repeated scandals, some murderous, when Archbishop Paul Marcinkus, an American hoodlum, ran the bank. He tied up with two of the biggest financial fraudsters in Italy, Michele Sindona and Roberto Calvi.<br /><br />In addition, during those same years, sleuths recovered more and more evidence of the Vatican’s robbery of Jews, using the money and gold it stole from them to finance the flight and life in exile of mass murderers in, mostly, South America and Syria.<br /><br />From time to time, some players ended up with a stiletto in the chest, or defenestrated, or hanged or -- a modern touch -- shot; but the modern story of the Holy Roman Church and money was not different from the story during the Renaissance, though without the refined taste.<br /><br />Pope John Paul II, of soon to be sainted memory, was unconcerned about the thievery and used the bank to fund subversion in Poland and elsewhere. Paul VI was part of the pro-Nazi wartime Vatican camorra, and Benedict XVI was a hands-off administrator who showed no interest in the crimes.<br /><br />The Vatican was not alone. Italy was thoroughly corrupt -- the Vatican was a conduit for under-the-table payoffs that, at one point, went to more than half the members of Parliament. Much of what we have learned about the Vatican’s crimes came from investigation and attacks launched by elements of the secular Italian government -- invariably from the left, but leftist deputies took Vatican money as well.<br /><br />It was secularism that finally cracked the Vatican Bank’s secrecy. The anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist rules adopted by the United States and the European Union narrowed and narrowed the room for the Vatican to maneuver, because as part of a worldwide organization, some of it legitimate, that needs to be able to transfer and store funds, the Vatican Bank needs to have correspondent banks. (The Vatican could have used commercial baks but it was, and is, touchy about its sovereignty.)<br /><br />When those banks started refusing to do business with the Vatican Bank, and when Pope Francis cleared out the supervisors who had never supervised, the church started showing signs of cleaning its house.<br /><br />At least Posner was hopeful of that as he finished his book toward the end of 2014, but the Vatican has been a gangster state for nearly 2,000 years and it would be naive to think that it will stay straight. After all, the crooks are still there."

417,5,3rd copy as one was worn out and one lost. This is a nice printing of a great book... so long as you are comfortable in your imagination and have an open and fertile mind.
418,1,"I wasn't paying attention and bought this thinking it was Mike Huckabee's book.  This book is a piece of vile garbage and I am sorry I bought it.  It went into the trash, where it belongs."
419,5,A book that first makes it clear what Islam believes and then demonstrates how that belief system differs from what Christianity believes. A must read for anyone who even considers engaging in a dialogue between these two religions. I appreciated the historical brief that helped put the whole of our differences in a proper context.

428,1,"Gave it one star because zero is not an option. It is not a field manual at all. Someone looked up online and printed it out and sent it. Its the size of normal printer paper. Very thick a cheaply made, like someone just printed it at there house. I needed a real one for my army mos and when I asked to return it I got a very rude return email saying I got what I was supposed to."

433,2,"I had heard all the hype about this book, and we had just gotten the DVD, so I was excited to read the book and jump onto the bandwagon. Unfortunately, because I have read so many similar books in the dystopian/post-apocalyptic genre, I believe I set my expectations rather high and this book simply did not meet them.<br /><br />The characters were flat, and the reasoning behind the decisions they made was flimsy at best. I felt completed disconnected from every single individual in this book, and because of that I didn’t care one bit what happened to any of them.<br /><br />The plot and backstory as well as the ultimate reveal felt half-done and, at times, totally illogical. There are so many questions and so many flawed, nonsense conclusions and connections that it makes the entire story unbelievable. I understand this is a fictional dystopian novel, but speculative fiction like this should at least attempt to make the storyline flow well, and the reasoning moving from one conclusion to the next should make a bit of sense.<br /><br />I found this book to be totally underwhelming. The characters, the plot, the writing, everything was flat and uninteresting to me. There are so many better books to read in this genre, I simply do not understand the fame this series has. I currently own the other books in this series, but I highly doubt I will be reading them, probably will donate to the library. I cannot recommend this book to anyone. If you’re thinking about reading “The Maze Runner”, go pick up “The Hunger Games”, “Divergent”, or “Under the Never Sky” instead. The plot and characters are significantly more engaging, and the overall feel is similar to “The Maze Runner”."
434,5,I couldn't put the book down.  Read it in a day.  I love it  very inspiring
435,4,k
436,5,"good teaching tools, my student love it"
437,5,I had the VHS tape on which this book was based on and i wanted the book. The book does give good info on people with unknown powers.

439,5,Family fun!
440,5,"I've been using this journal for the past month and absolutely love it! There are verses at the bottom of each page and I greatly enjoy reading them AFTER I've finished journaling. The verses often times relate to what I've written. I intend to keep this jounal and pass it down to my children, in hopes they will learn more from my experiences and grow closer to the Lord. This is a beautiful piece for that intention."
441,1,"Seriously? I read so many rave reviews of this and other books by the author.  Most of the reviews I read cited it as eloquent, sensual, well crafted, etc.  While I think anyone who can complete and publish a novel should get one star for determination, I found it to be barely well written, with unlikable unredeemable characters; the romance aspect was ungraceful, unimaginative, impossible to care about.  I'm curious about her other well advertised novels, could they truly be as irritating as The French Gardener? I'm not sure I could part with more valuable time in order to find out."
442,4,item as expected and seems to be as advertised.

444,5,A wise and relevant book. Wonderful for devotional reading.
445,5,Great mystery series.

450,4,Very interesting and helpful book.
451,5,This book is a must read. Its material is timeless. Ageless wisdom through the heart.
452,2,"This thinking is flawed. The grass is always greenest where you cultivate it Not somewhere which Involves compromising the most Important relationship In your life. Cheating takes away the  time, energy and consideration necessary to make a relationship work. Each time the adulterer engages in the affair she is not having sex with her spouse, so how does the affair help the marital relationship? If sex is to go beyond the scope of the marriage the parties must discuss it in advance and workout a solution-maybe an open marriage? But once either spouse steps outside the vows and cheats the partnership agreement is broken and trust is lost."
453,5,Extraordinario Libro
454,5,well done
455,4,"Found the Kindle version unworkable; complained right away and Amazon refunded me. I then got the old-fashioned book and no more troubles. I have followed this eating plan pretty faithfully since the 2d week of january, so I guess I'm a little over five weeks in. I'm probably 30 pounds overweight, all gained in a pretty big hurry since perimeno set in. I'd love to get rid of all that. Definitely was carb-addicted -- salty stuff like chips, way more than sweet stuff.<br /><br />Week 1 on this plan was somewhat difficult and I did not see any huge weight loss, which was a bit disappointing. However ... I have found it to be a pretty easy plan to stay on, over time. I have to cook/plan more, but ... it's not so bad and for sure I am eating more healthy food. Best of all, I have lost six pounds and three waist inches in this amount of time. It does not sound like so much, but I've been messing with various eating plans for three or four years and have not seen consistent loss. I'm perfectly happy with one pound a week as long as it keeps going off and ... stays off.<br /><br />I've discovered, in general, that I can still eat some carbs (most veggies are actually 'freebies on this plan') but not very much if I want to keep losing weight. I have found his concept of 'sugar calories' very easy to grasp and it is simple to count your daily totals, knowing when to stop if you've reached your max for the day. I'd say that on the 'happy' days I have definitely tried to keep below 350 or so, vs the 'allowed' 500 sugar calories. If I eat that many for five days in a row, the scale stops moving.<br /><br />All in all ... fairly pleased so far. There are some additional helpful recipes at his website and I have enjoyed experimenting with baking with flax, almond flour, and coconut flour for low-carb baked goods."
456,5,interesting book! recommended. so helpful!
457,5,I hope this book never ends.

459,5,A Wonderful read!!!  Very Happy I came across this book & decided to purchased it. Will be purchasing more as gifts.
460,4,"I have been following the Illuminati's official messages since October 2013, shortly after its Twitter account @ILLUMINATIAM was conceived. In addition, I have received e-mail updates from its representatives at the Department of Citizen Outreach since around the same time. At some point in 2014, a Facebook page for the Illuminati was created, and has since been verified as official by that network. The organization also has official YouTube and Google+ accounts. Its official website is illuminati.am.    The messages broadcast by the Illuminati over the past months have kept my attention and kindled curiosity, although they have been frustratingly vague. This book offers a higher volume of information. Some aspects are delivered in great detail, but many broad strokes remain. If you follow the messages of the Illuminati, you are told that they are \\""always watching out for you.\\"" Its members' primary, and perhaps sole, purpose, they say, is to sustain the survival and prosperity of the human species. The book touches on Universal Design, planetary law, human potential, wealth, God, a path to membership, some of the Illuminati's methods and sources of influence, and a \\""new dawn\\"" (age).    What is clear to me from reading this piece of literature is that council, and perhaps ranking, members of the Illuminati have knowledge I do not yet hold, and may never. It is a humbling read, for sure, in the sense that a design by humans to ensure the survival of the human species is going to continue, or perhaps occur, in a manner not yet made publicly known. To further this sense of humility, it is made apparent that advances toward the understanding of the human mind and subconscious have been uncovered by the Illuminati, though the public is evidently not yet ready to receive this wisdom. There is talk of abundance for all, undiscovered energy sources, no war, and the obliteration of nations' borders in years to come. What raises some concern is the expressed disregard for ethics or morals by the Illuminati, which is openly admitted in the text. Again, its stated mission is to guarantee that humanity continues to survive and thrive. How it achieves that end apparently does not matter. This is not an extension of criticism toward its practices, for as I already acknowledged, there is much I remain in the dark about.    The principle of \\""the Light\\"" is still one I have not completely grasped on a level satisfactory to me, but is something mentioned often by the Illuminati through Internet transmissions and this book. If nothing else, I equate the Light to what keeps me going through each day. To me, the Light is a personal matter. Online I observe many citizens, as the Illuminati would refer to them, displaying hand signals indicating signs of loyalty to the organization and claiming to have found the Light. The Illuminati is not the sole source of Light for me. It is written plainly in the literature that one should remain \\""doubtful toward any who claim authority, including the Illuminati.\\"" For this reason, and others, I am not a citizen who is yet prepared to pledge loyalty, or invest unhindered trust, toward a group I still know so little about.    With that said, since I found the Illuminati's official Twitter page alone, in my car, late at night, on my iPhone, in a Wal-Mart parking lot, from a retweet of someone I follow, I have not wished to turn my sights away. At this point, I question whether I could if I wanted to. I have been less than eager to signal any friends or family toward the Illuminati's official outlets. There is a factor of stigma associated with such a subject, yes, but honestly, accepting these new truths has been a burden to digest. Still, it's a burden I undertake willingly. I know what I read is true. My appetite for truth has not been quenched. I remain a follower.    If you choose to embrace this book, the only advice I have is to be vigilant and critical in doing so. Personally, I do not believe it was meant foreveryone. I have read it with attention and care. In doing so, I found myself enlightened to subtle cues found between the lines, so to speak. I won't give away what these caveats are, for they are still only hints toward greater truth, but were probably not meant for uninquiring minds.    I'll leave this with an interesting fact, then a question:    1) The copy of \\""Illuminatiam: The First Testament of the Illuminati\\"" I received indicated, on one of its back pages, that it was printed in Lexington, Kentucky, the day I ordered it from Amazon.    2) Is this book available in languages other than English? Given the global scope of the Illuminati's influence, and its self-proclaimed desire to spread its message to all citizens, everywhere, I see multi-lingual options for this text as optimal."
461,5,Fascinating work. An inspiring piece of work by Mr. Isaacson.
462,4,"Inspiring , it`s good to get into your studio and stay there."
463,5,good experience
464,5,Very pleased
465,1,This book is a total waste of money.  Very thin and with very little information.  You can do better on your own by visiting a few websites.
466,5,"Este libro me enseñó que combinando la respiración consciente con con la auto contemplación, podremos superar y fluir por los momentos más difíciles que podamos atravesar en la vida. La energía para renovarnos y salir adelante esta dentro de nosotros. Las técnicas que se mencionan en el libro son de fácil y practica aplicación en la vida cotidiana y de un gran impacto en nuestro bienestar. no dejo de leerlo una y otra vez. Gracias Julio!"
467,5,"Practical Paleo gave me the tools and knowledge to make a whole foods lifestyle work for me. It's known in the paleo community as the go-to for newbies, and it's the first thing I bought when I decided to switch to a paleo diet.<br />But it's more than just the book you hand your friends when they ask why the heck you've thrown out your canola oil. It taught me to cook, to navigate a kitchen, to buy and prepare foods that make me feel great, and to respect my body in a way I have never been able to before. It helped me heal my gut and move past years of gastrointestinal problems. It represents a wealth of knowledge I just don't think you could find in any other single source.<br /><br />My favorite part of Practical Paleo is that it lives up to its name. Information is organized in a straightforward format with general descriptions of a paleo diet near the front. I see this in many paleo cookbooks, but Diane's work stands apart because it is both very detailed and very easy to digest. You can throw the tear-out guides on your fridge and figure out how to eat out at different types of restaurants. It makes this lifestyle make sense.<br /><br />The cooking section is equally well presented, and honestly taught me many of the basic techniques I now use every day. Her spice blends are my favorite part of this section; I use them to season many of my meals and can't believe how much they've elevated my kitchen game. There are also all sorts of useful tutorials on everything from basic chopping to batch cooking bacon and creating sauces and staples you'll use all the time.<br /><br />While I haven't used the meal plans, I so appreciate having them as a resource to turn to for friends who develop health conditions or if I find I need to change my diet in some way. The best part about these sections are the supplement recommendations. They allow you to create a customized plan with some supplementation that I've found generally lines up with recommendations you might get from a functional medicine practitioner. I definitely turn to that resource regularly.<br /><br />So when you take that all into account, Practical Paleo isn't just a cookbook. It's a functional medicine resource, a primer on a paleo lifestyle, an instructional manual for your kitchen, a resource for newbies and, for me, a constant source of inspiration. If you only buy one paleo cookbook, make it this one and get so much more for your money!"
468,5,It's exactly what we needed to stay on track with the reno on the bus. Thanks so much.
469,5,Great reference book on arts integration in the classroom.
470,5,"Amazing book, heartfelt stories, well written."
471,5,"I received my copy of the book, and did not put it down until I finished reading it. I found it to be an enlightening read, and found that the majority of what it said, held true to my own style of living before even reading it. It held more insight besides this, but I believe this book, holds value to what is written within the pages. I would recommend reading it, regardless of whether you are a skeptic or not."
472,5,"easy to read, practical advice, makes you feel rejuvenated."
473,5,Excellent
474,5,Fantastic art book! I fully recommend this.
475,5,Absolutely what I wanted and expected.  Very professional service with timely delivery.  Would Highly recommend!
476,4,"There were a few things that struck me about Reviver as I began reading, first, the prose is exceptionally well written. Tight, tense and clear it was a rare moment to not feel absorbed by the coherence of the story. Second however was the slight tropey plot. A forensic professional who speaks to the recently dead to build a court case, never seen that before.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the tale goes places unexpected, and most enjoyable is Patrick's ability to riff about the social consequences of 'revival' while keeping the story alive.<br /><br />I must confess the final confrontation and aftermath started to get a bit cheesy and cliche, but I don't regret reading this one for a second."
477,3,"This is most definitely a promising start to a new series.  The only thing is that it doesn't have the excitement of landmark books such as the Tom Clancy ones.  This is an &#34;almost made it&#34; book and deserves reading as long as you have the time.  From this start, the series has a very good chance of improving, so give it a chance and a try."
478,5,great book pick one on up
479,5,A great book for all investment banking professionals.
480,5,"I love this book, while the words differ from the song my mother used to sing, my daughter loves it as one her many bedtime books. The translation in english while not exact give you a good idea"
481,5,"Great textbook. Easy to read. Perhaps not as internally coherent as the other leading introductory text to this subject (Purves, et al.)"
482,2,"This book paints a convincing picture of the arrogance, greed, and brutality of the Nantucket whalers, not only toward whales but toward their own crews, who they underpaid and underfed at the best of times and--at the worst of times-- ate.  There's nothing new about all this, however, so it's a little puzzling that the book was so well-received.  Perhaps it was part of the reaction against environmentalism that got going in the 1990s.  All kinds of scientific evidence began to emerge in the 1960s that whales, far from being the dim-witted floating tubs of valuable oil that the whalers thought they were, are highly intelligent in ways that we can't yet begin to understand.  The author acknowledges that sperm whales have the largest brains of any living thing, but otherwise writes of them pretty much as the whalers regarded them-- as \\""stocks\\"" to be \\""harvested.\\"" You get the feeling that the author wouldn't really mind if whalers started \\""harvesting\\"" them again, as part of the Yankee ingenuity he evidently admires.  But that's a pretty anachronistic way of regarding the planet if humans are going to keep living on it, and there's no place else for us to live.  Still, this book is more readable than Moby Dick, I'll say that for it."
483,5,Another excellent book by Jeff Shaara.  This one follows the American Army and particularly the Marines into battle in WW1  It gives you an inside view of how the battles were fought and what the men involved went through. I HIGHLY recommend this Novel to all.<br /><br />TOM
484,5,One of my favorite books that I read last year.  An incredible story.  I could barely put the book down once I started reading.
485,5,Great book. Feedback I got from my 14 years old son it's helping him very good.
486,5,Great quality
487,5,"I've watched the Game of Thrones HBO series and thought I'd read the books it was inspired by. The show follows very closely to the books, but the books are full of much more information and detail. If you are interested, prepare to invest some time. The first book is ~900 pages."

493,5,The rhyming scheme makes for pleasant reading and the illustrations<br />are fantastic.  I love the way they are mostly in black and white but<br />then the splash of color adds pizzazz!  A must for every youngster<br />just beginning that scary new phase called kindergarten.
494,5,"Disturbing and definitely worth a read. Not for everyone, I wouldn't recommend this book for children."

500,5,"Book is great, I made the mistake of ordering from a vendor who mislead me on shipping."
501,3,"Let me start  by saying that I have not, to-date, been a big fan of Steve Berry, as I've found him to be one of those \\""hit or miss\\"" authors; with more of his books being misses than hits for me. However, because I mostly enjoyed Berry's last book, The Lincoln Myth, I decided to give The Patriot Threat a read. Overall, I found it, in typical Berry fashion, to be well-researched with an interesting plot concept -- but, also typical, I found Berry's execution of what had the potential to be a very entertaining story to be marred by mediocre writing and weak character development.<br /><br />Without getting into the details of the plot (which can be gotten from the Amazon book description above), I was hoping to like The Patriot Threat because I found the basic concept on which the plot is based to be interesting and intriguing; that being: What if our federal income tax is illegal? And, in my opinion, Berry did a very good job researching this issue and did well in formulating a story around it that had a good amount of action and excitement (albeit at times far-fetched).<br /><br />Unfortunately, perhaps because Berry has achieved such a high level of monetary success with his Cotton Malone series, it seems, in my opinion, that he is more than comfortable using the 'same old, same  old' formula without as much need as in the past to provide his readers with some quality writing and character development in executing his story. As a result, I found The Patriot Thread to be just a mediocre read overall; whereas if Berry put more effort into developing his characters so that they didn't seem so one-dimensional and his plot so that it didn't seem as disjointed and implausible, I think it would have been a very good thriller<br /><br />If you are a long-time fan of Berry's books, my guess is that you'll read his latest book and disregard my review -- and perhaps, although hopefully not -- even give it a \\""no/not helpful\\"" vote. On the other hand, I hope my review will give some \\""food for thought\\"" to those readers have had mixed experiences or no experience with Berry's books and are looking for some opinions to help them decide if The Patriot Threat is a book for them.o those readers have had mixed experiences or no experience with Berry's books and are looking for some opinions to help them decide if The Patriot Threat is a book for them."

504,5,My granddaughter loved it.
505,5,Purchased as a christmas gift.  It was well received
506,3,"Not a bad read.  A bit preachy in the last chapter.  If you've read any of the other Duggar books, this one falls right in line with the principles the girls follow based on Ma and Pa Duggar's teachings."
507,5,love cassie edwards...
508,5,"Amazing insight by this heroic priest, Patrick Desbois.  In the days before the Nazis invented the gas chambers, they used to march Jews from small towns into the forest where they made them undress and then shot them into open mass graves. The soldiers were ordered not to use more than one bullet per Jew in order to preserve the supply of bullets for the war effort.  Father Desbois travelled through Eastern Europe for over a dozen years to the small towns where surviving villagers took him to the killing fields where he and assistants used metal detectors to find the buried bullets used to kill the Jews.  He gathered up the bullets as evidence and concluded that another one to one and a half million Jews had been killed in the forests of Eastern Poland and Ukraine who were totally undocumented. In several cases, villagers told him the ground was moving for three days, because wounded Jews and infants who were thrown in alive, took three days to die.  The book is spell binding as it reveals personal heartbreaking stories of individual villagers some of whom who were school friends of the Jewish victims who recounted these stories to Father Debois.  a MUST read for anyone who wants to understand the depths of the evil of the Nazi empire and why we need to fight hate today."

510,5,"This is a straight forward, easy-to-understand, biblical explanation of God's providence and will. It won't necessarily give you the warm fuzzies but it's the truth many Evangelicals need to read. I spent many years struggling with questions of God's will for my life and came to similar conclusions after a lot of Bible study which contradicted what I had been raised to think. I wish I'd read this book when it first came out. I could have avoided a lot of anguish. The book is divided up as follows:<br /><br />MAKING SENSE OF CIRCUMSTANCES<br />1. Things don't happen<br />2. Making sense of circumstances<br />3. Why me?<br />4. Does God control?<br />5. Believing Jacob's lie<br />GOD'S PART, OUR PART<br />6. How people operate<br />7. But is it scriptural?<br />8. How God operates<br />9. God in you<br />10. A few subtleties<br />11. Get your priorities straight<br />12. The purpose(s) of life<br />13. Beyond the platitudes<br />14. You don't have to<br />15. Of course you can<br />16. Cooperation<br />17. God's will<br />18. Prayer<br />19. So what?"
511,5,"Murder Tightly Knit is book two, in the Amish Village Mystery series.<br /><br />Amber, manager of the Amish Village shops, is now married to Tate Bowman.  She and Hannah Troyer have become close friends and Hannah may soon be receiving a marriage proposal from Jesse Miller.<br /><br />As the story opens, Owen Esch, a young Amish man is murdered.  On the same day, Jesse's brother, Andrew, returns home from traveling.  Rumors swirl that the murderer is Amish.  Andrew becomes a suspect.  Then, a federal officer is called in, when a local survivalist group becomes part of the investigation.  Another Amish worker, at The Village, Mary, is implicated and appears to be very frightened, of something or someone.<br /><br />Amber, in trying to help Mary, finds herself (and those she loves) in extreme danger, as the clues lead to the murderer.  It will take these friends, along with other locals, to resolve this case.<br /><br />Vannetta does her research, creates strong characters and always keeps us guessing.  I am never disappointed."
512,5,great book
513,5,"Just perfect for a toddler - 3 years.  New behaviors and new ways to manage the development processes.  I am a fan of Dan Siegel and his research, and the new knowledge he is sharing!"
514,5,Brilliant.
515,5,"This book is over a hundred years old. Life, Death and the Resurrection of Jesus. Written by a selection of Theologians and still applicable today."
516,5,"This is the best investment I have made in a long time. I have been a Christian for about 38 years and even wrote a book in defense of my Christian faith against what I saw were the glaring shortcomings of Islam. Recently, I turned my attention to Christianity to ask of it the same questions I had raised against Islam. I was disappointed to find that Christianity does not fair any better. As a Christian, I was rather good at making excuses for God, the Bible and the Christian religion. I accepted things in Christianity that I would not tolerate in other areas of my life. Two years ago I made the decision to reject the God Hypothesis altogether and I have never felt so liberated intellectually. I had too many sacred cows; now I have none. Reading &#34;Christianity is Not Great&#34; has finally released me from self-deceit. It encouraged me to be the scientist that I have been trained to be and value reality and reject mythology. Regardless of where one believes, the material in this book provides vital education. Thanks John and all those who contributed to producing this truly valuable resource."
517,5,GREAT
518,5,I loved the variety of options for ways of making a dish ahead.  Everything was very clearly written.

522,5,"I do love it!  It's a cute take on the popular &#34;Three Little.....books&#34;.  Best of all, one of the 3 little fish [the SMARTEST one] is named Kim, so I'm in this book, so you know I had to have it!  I'm pretty sure my 4s/5s will love it too!"
523,5,"If you're in need of spiritual guidance and hope, then this is the book for you. Stephanie does an amazing job at recollecting a very rough time in her life and using hope as a key factor to help us as struggling women to have hope too. Once you pick it up, you won't be able to put it down. A quick read definitely worth purchasing!"

525,5,"Jack Brewer needs to leave his old life behind and start a new one. Will he be able to? It's easy to get caught up in the suspense of wondering if he will . . . even when everything seems to be working out well for him. So his story can grab you no matter what your family background happens to be. But if somebody on your family tree made a great migration of their own, this will provoke some extra thought -- is there a similar reason why your grandfather packed up from Point A and moved to Point Z? Are there some twists and turns like these lurking back there in your ancestry? Blood Is Thicker Than Color will give you some extra entertainment in provoking thoughts about how Mr. Brewer's travels might have been duplicated back in your own family's history."
526,5,A wonderful travel series with Dodsworth and duck. This one takes him to Tokyo and its amazing that I was able to tell my daughter that I had been to some of the places that this odd couple visited. It is a wonderful way to find out about different cities in the world. I have become a big fan of Tim Egan.
527,4,"An experienced solver would find these puzzles straightforward and relatively easy, possibly solving some in ten minutes or so. This is mainly due to the over-reliance on anagrams and hidden words. However, a less experienced solver would welcome this as it allows you to get a toe-hold in the grid. I found the clues followed the cryptic 'rules' closely and appeared to be constructed to give the inexperienced solver pleasure, rather than a vehicle for the setter to show how clever or obtuse he can be. The variety in the grids was also fairly limited -labyrinths, jigsaws, acrostics, two-way word rings - no answer or clue manipulations, no themed entries, etc. There are a few errors in the book but not enough to spoil your enjoyment. Answers are at the rear with the standard cryptic key. Happy solving"
528,5,Started book but trying to read tooo many at one time. Get the book how can you fail with this author?
529,3,"I purchased this book after purchasing 52 Scrapbooking Challenges by Elsie Flannigan/Creating Keepsakes, so, I can't help but to compare a little here. Both books are lead by two very different scrapbookers, hence, they will appeal to different types of scrapbookers. I'm not an artsy type...that is to say, my scrapbooking style is more clean and graphic than boho chic, so, Elsie's book offered many more inspiring challenges. Elizabeth's 52 More Scrapbooking Challenges I found to be much less inspiring. Some of the challenges just seemed to be throwaways that most basic scrapbookers have probably already done. I think the type of scrapbooker that would benefit most from and be most inspired/challenged by this book would be the kind of artist that makes order out of chaos, so to speak - the kind of scrapper that would need a challenge that would force them to make chaos out of order, instead."
530,4,"Very enjoyable follow up to the show and movie.  I would give it 5 stars, but I felt the ending was not as strong as the rest of the story.  If you haven't watched any episodes lately, I recommend watching &quot;Objects in Space&quot; and the movie &quot;Serenity&quot; before reading so these events will be fresh in your mind for the story.  But, it shouldn't hurt your experience if you don't watch these first."
531,5,The cover has good pep talk.
532,5,Son loved!
533,4,A good book for budding entrepreneurs. Many of the concepts are great to help you understand how to make a successful business.

542,5,"My boyfriend had been searching for this book (as well as Homeland) to complete his collection. He even messaged RA Savlatore, whom replied that the books were out of print, and he was unable to help him. After months of searching, I found this book. It was a first edition print of the book, and both the book and book jacket were in mint condition. I couldn't have asked for a better copy. The package arrived two weeks earlier than anticipated. It definitely made for a very Merry Christmas!"
543,2,"Although I have had my MAC Book Pro for about 2 years I have yet to use most of the features since I don't know what they are for and everything seems quite cryptic. I purchased this book to help become more familiar with all the Mac features. I found the instructions are not specific enough to be really helpful. So, unless the price is reduced by 50% I'd say this book is not<br />cost effective. It is little more than a coffee table book."
544,5,good product quick delivery
545,5,Great photographs of beautiful rugs.
546,4,"Lean on Me is an honest look at the importance of community in our lives. I appreciated Anne Miller's vulnerability to show the highs and lows of community and how she doesn't always get it right. I loved how she even admits to still wanting to avoid times of community. This book was refreshing. It doesn't tell you what to do, nor give you a step by step process on how to have a successful community. Lean on Me tells the story of a girl and her journey of being intentional with the people around her. She lets the reader see that it's okay to let people in at your low points as well as your high points. That you need people to celebrate and mourn with you, as well as carry you when needed.<br />If you struggle with having an authentic community in your life. If your relationships tend to be surface, you need to grab this book."
547,3,This was a fun collection of well known sayings tied together to offer encouragement.  But I was hoping for something different so was a little disappointed.
548,5,"OMG I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!!! At first, I was like meh, then I started reading, and I couldn't put it down! I would read it again and again! I've already shared it for more to read! Can't wait to get your other books and enjoy them as well!"
549,5,I also included this book with the Brother LS2125i Machine. Excellent.
550,5,my son finally opened this up after I got it in April for Christmas for him and loved it. you really can not tell how darn creepy that mask is until you have it on .this is great. there may be a issue in the future because of a thin strap to hold it on so just be careful w/ that
551,5,This book is amazing and a must read!!!  Great job!!!
552,2,"Only 3 projects are circular and others are not as casual as I had hoped. I have already taken this to the library, in hopes someone else can get what they want from it."

556,5,Gentle and thoughtful book.
557,4,My 4th grade daughter loves this series!
558,5,Beautifully illustrated
559,4,"Published in 2004, I am reading it in 2014 and here writing the first review on Amazon. It may be that people think this is a specialist volume which has its dialog in specialist journals or privately in correspondence. Certainly the book is addressed to the field of archaeology more than to the general public. But as a general reader, one who has read a few other archaeological books and thinks that archaeology matters, I find this volume very worthwhile and informative. First and foremost, it is remarkable to think that the notion of gender has not played much of a role in archaeology up to now. And that Nelson's main point is to suggest how engendering should take place in the myriad of sub-fields that make up the discipline. I might have been looking for a definitive statement about gender in archaeology when I started reading this. But I realized quickly that I would not find it. Instead I found a story of the exclusion of women and the mindless backlash against including them in the field. Archaeology should be ashamed of itself. And I know that Nelson is right because in all the reading I have done in this field, I have been looking for this elephant in the room and not finding it. When I finally came upon Marija Gimbutas, I found an author who made a serious effort to engender her archaeology. And then I found no one paid her much attention. Nelson mentions her but seems to defer to the hair splitting attacks that have unfairly isolated her writings. Whatever the ultimate conclusions about gender in archaeology, if there ever are any, this book helped me understand the real state of thinking in the field of archaeology regarding gender. I just wish someone in the field would write for the general public and explain what adding gender to our prehistory might mean and how it would look. You don't need scientific proof to start us thinking along some different lines than patriarchy which as gotten us into our current dead end civilization."
560,5,The book was everything I wanted and in the end it was donated to public library so others may enjoy it also.
561,5,great book for the homeowner
562,3,"Yes, pictures are nice but there is not ample room for keeping a proper engagement book..also, important dates noted are omitted..For example, I'd rather know when Daylight Savings time kicks in than John Muir's birthday..There is little note space, no address space and I won't buy another of these next year."
563,5,"This is a fascinating book.  Dominique Ansel weaves a vision and you experience being in the kitchen with him. While I may never cook from this book, I loved reading it."
564,5,I really like the numerous different artists represented in this book.  It is a good survey of interesting contemporary landscape painters.
565,5,"A ****ing classic of American literature.<br /><br />Every three year old should have this on his shelf, as it will improve his vocabulary, if not his attitude."

Her stay in England is coming to a close but what will happen?<br /><br />This short story captures your attention from the very beginning. The writing style is amazing and eye catching and all the characters are awesome. The way they're described, you feel like you know them personally. Great read!<br /><br />This story contains a lot of sexual scenes and is aimed for a more mature audience of 18+<br /><br />*Reviewed on behalf of Book-lover book blog"
567,5,love these books
568,5,Excellent book!  We love Howard and Beth.
569,5,The cookbook is easy to read and follow. The recipes follow the paleo diet plan and make it easy to plan meals.
570,5,"I saw that this book was given a 2 Star Review, which was a complete shock. The only bad thing about this book is that the photographs are so small, and that is something that can't be helped, since they were taken in 1934 when the book was originally published in Japan. I will admit that it is a thin book, but to say that it doesn't have much substance is not true. In this treatise on the fighting techniques of toudi (China/Tang hand), Itoman admits that he is not the best practitioner of the art, nor does he have the most thorough understanding, but he felt it was his duty to record it to the best of his ability before it was lost. The techniques and concepts he describes and illustrates in this book give us a real link to the past. If you pay close attention, you will see him mention and demonstrate things that were discussed by masters like Motobu Choki, Chibana Chosin, and Nagamine Shoshin as being true karate methods. These are things that have been lost in a lot of dojo all over the world, including Japan and Okinawa, unfortunately. Through translating works like this one, Mario McKenna Sensei is helping set up-and-coming karateka on a path toward a more authentic karate. I would say that for any karateka interested in learning about how karate was taught before it was taught publicly, and before it was called &#34;empty hand,&#34; this book is a must-have!"
571,4,The book was in good condition except that it was breaking apart from the middle.
572,4,"This book tells a story of all of creation proclaiming Jesus' birth. I have The Jesus Storybook Bible written by the same woman, so when I saw she had also written this, I was very excited. I have a 4 yr old and a 2.5 yr old who will sit through the reading of it, and they seem to understand that all the animals are speaking of Jesus, so it is well written. I think it is a beautiful book. The only thing I don't like about it, is that the writing on the last page doesn't seem to be cohesive with the flow of the rest of the book, like she had something to say but didn't know how to say it, and so just stated it a little matter-of-factly. I do still really like the book though."
573,5,"A wonderful yarn filled with twists and turns, humor, great character developments and surprises."
574,3,Same old story. Eat like the author suggests.
575,4,great book
576,5,outstanding
577,5,This is a beautiful book that can help any resident or traveler discover nice places to relax in London. We saw some old favorites and look forward to exploring some of the new ones Ms. Wall tells about in this book. She describes each place and tells how to get there on public transportation. Many are free and some cost very little. The photographs are beautiful. We'll be taking this book with us to London.
578,4,"Here's the thing about most Jon Scieszka children's books: I kind of can't stand them, but my 2 1/2 year old boy loves ALL of them.  I'll defer to him.  He loves the smash crash team - Jack, Dan, Gabby, and the gang.  While these aren't exactly great literature, they do draw in the kids who love things like trucks."
579,5,Great Book. A Codex  when doing research of shoes though out history.
580,5,great book. very helpful and more teachers should be using this method
581,3,The book is short and the sloth is SO small. Like its about 5 in. Tall and it's just super tiny. Other then that it has everything it says and it's soft and cute💗
582,5,"Very impressed with the illustrations, easy to follow directions, and varieties."
583,3,The book well worn and all pages of photos and plates had been torn out by previous owner/s
584,5,"Written in a tactical and sensitive manner. If you read this book prepare to throw out most of the propaganda you have been fed and open your mind to America's failed drug policy. Highly recommended, jam-packed with research and facts that you can't live without."
585,5,"I enjoy this book every single day that I pick it up. Each day offers a short and practical message for refocusing your day.  Sometimes my husband and I read it together and discuss, sometimes I read it on my own. This book is down to earth: real thoughts for real people. In three words: essential, inspiring, thought-provoking. Read it...you'll thank yourself...and the author!"
586,5,"This is the first Batman comic I have ever read, and what a great start! Also, the first comic by Frank Miller, who certainly has the reputation as a master storyteller, that I have read.<br />I loved the complexity of the Batman and James Gordon characters. Both of them are just beginning their &#34;careers,&#34; while dealing with internal and external conflicts. Bruce Wayne returns to Gotham after twelve years to clean up the crime laden streets and seek justice for his parents murder, while being labeled a vigilante by the police. He is depicted as sometimes careless and reckless in his exploits, injuring police and wandering into dangerous territory. James Gordon settles in Gotham City with his pregnant wife, and begins working as a Lieutanant. He quickly learns how corrupt and broken the justice system is in Gotham. Through various methods of intimidation, Gordon doesn't give in to the corruption and takes matters into his own hands. Also, unable to confront is wife and dealing with inner demons, Gordon has an affair with a coworker.<br />The origin stories of both characters didn't seem to change much, but expanded on brilliantly by Frank Miller. He did an amazing job of making Batman and James Gordon more vunerable. I love te ending of this story. We see the preliminary partnership between Batman and James Gordon start to develop. Overall, the story is more about James Gordon and how he came to accept the help of Batman. He begins to understand that, due to the corruption of the city, it needs a vigilante hero."
587,5,"OMG, this is exactly what I hoped it would be when I placed the order.  It won't teach you how to play piano blues...for that you'd be better served by the books by Tim Richards, Tricia Woods, or Mark Harrison (my favorite: Tricia Woods' 3 volume Blues Keyboard Method) coupled with lessons from a flesh-and-blood teacher.  But once you have the basics, this book is packed with ideas to make you a better blues pianist, from licks and trill ideas, to style advice (e.g. how to play like Otis Spann, or Barrelhouse).  Some of the \\""lessons\\"" could be the a true lesson that could be worked on all week; others are more like short \\""ideas\\"" than a full lesson, but either way you will get your money's worth with this surprisingly thick book."
588,5,"Jonathan Morrow’s timely book, Questioning the Bible, confronts eleven tough challenges pervading an already skeptic society. He tackles questions such as whether or not “the Biblical text been corrupted over the centuries,” and whether the Bible is “unscientific” as many skeptics allege. Morrow addresses each issue with an important balance of clarity and brevity. He effectively lays a foundation for readers to think critically about these potentially life-altering questions. In doing so, Morrow offers helpful direction when engaging others in the public square.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to the Christian and skeptic alike. Anyone would benefit from reading this material, which truly matters. I thoroughly appreciated Morrow’s ability to simplify complex ideas for the average Joe’s comprehension. Also, structurally, I appreciated the conclusions ending each chapter, which further cement his ideas and main points. Furthermore, Questioning the Bible provided a much needed contrast from the technical textbooks I typically pore over."
589,5,For sure an unusual opinion of good old Teddy.
590,5,My kid usaed it. He got a prety good score.
591,5,"Cecil Roth is a wonderful history writer! He just has this way of writing, that's so enjoyable. I do have a complaint about his lack of references, which is true in every work of his I've seen. However, I find his style of writing to just have this wonderful, educated flow to it. This book is the second part to Roth's masterpiece (http://www.amazon.com/Dona-Gracia-House-Nasi-Cecil/dp/0827604114), and it's just as good as the first in my humble opinion. I recommend them both!"
592,5,Very good
593,5,"Well written book by a very knowledgeable author!  The photos are excellent, and I learned much from this publication.  Highly recommended!"
594,5,"This is an excellent reference book, but it also is a must read if you want to prevent illness or weaknesses that usually  comes with<br />aging.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in the good health of someone over 60."
595,5,"Napoleon Bonaparte has had much written about him as a military leader, political entity and one of the &#34;movers and shakers&#34; of world history. I do not believe there has been a single volume written with such clarity, attention to detail and &#34;readability&#34; as Mr. Roberts recent biography. As I told one friend upon reading the book, if one needs one volume to contain this larger than life figure, Mr. Robert's book is the volume to own. Napoleon's beginnings and rise to power in Revolutionary France is well documented along with all his battles and all his political maneuvers. The book is replete with maps and two sections of paintings from the era.<br />As for Mr. Bonaparte himself, the man behind the &#34;Emperor&#34; is well revealed through personal anecdotes; his devotion to his troops is well documented along with &#34;clarification&#34; of many things he was supposed to have said. Also revealed is the skewed viewpoint of Napoleon as &#34;The Beast of Europe&#34; (indeed, history is written by the winners along with all the propaganda that entails).<br />Napoleon Bonaparte is almost &#34;larger than life&#34;; Mr. Roberts manages to tread the thin line between myth-making and reality presenting Napoleon as the giant he became and the man he always was."
596,5,"We have lived in wooded areas for years and I can finally identify the trees we live near.  It contains info on bark, leaves etc.  Very interesting and helpful."
597,2,"I agree with the prior review.  The front of the book looks like it is about &#34;Santa Claus&#34;.  It is my fault not reading the details that it is only about a city named &#34;Santa Claus&#34;.  The book is a great book if you are interested in this town, no so great if you are looking for details about &#34;Santa Claus&#34;."
598,5,"A good history of the follies, mishaps, booms, and busts of the financial world."
599,5,Excellent book that will sit on my coffee table this Christmas.
600,5,all I expected - use it over and over.
601,5,Helped my son.
602,5,GREAT
603,5,Have not finished reading it but already know it is a bit of history that I never heard of before.  The Navajo Indians served in a unique and spectacular way to aid in the victory of WWII.  I am happy to have found this book.
604,4,"This 576 page book has good approaches, and plenty of good suggestions, for caring for people with dementia.  It also has much repetition, & could probably have been done effectively in half as many pages.  I have read half of it so far, & plan to read other books for comparison."
605,2,You can read half of each page. The other half is a page printed as if it had been photo copied  and torn in half but with no continuity to the next page. Even if they were xeroxing primary source material it's hard to imagine how they managed to do this. Very disappointing.
606,4,wonderful writing...
607,4,This is kind of a &#34;Thor meets The Fellowship of the Ring&#34; and it's great. Aaron does an amazing job writing for the God of Thunder.
608,5,If you like the taste of wonderful humor and religion...T.Faye Griffin will not disappoint. A Five Star Book written by a Five Star woman
609,5,very pleased
610,5,Simply delighted exactly what i expected
611,5,Just love these old books. In very good shape.
612,1,"I love the bolo series. I spent four years of my childhood checking old used book stores constantly to find the entire collection of bolo stories.  Almost every username I have is somehow related to bolos. My email address has bolo in the name. I love Keith Laumer's bolo stories, and I think that the many writers who have contributed to the bolo universe have done amazing jobs.  Some have even done better than Laumer himself.<br /><br />John Ringo is literally the only writer I have read that has utterly failed the series.<br /><br />The story barely follows the bolos, the characters are obnoxious, and it reads like a political commentary. Come on Ringo. Did you even READ any of the prior books?  It's not like the formula for a bolo book is difficult.<br /><br />To anybody looking for a good entry in the Bolo series, I would suggest any of Keith Laumer's entries.  If you'd rather have a larger novel sized Bolo book, Old Soldiers by David Webber is a good read."
613,5,"This CD and Book are very comprehensive and have lots of excellent advice about not only Wills but many other useful legal documents related to your estate.  I would buy this again, it will save you lots of money and produce great legal documents."
614,3,received as offered
615,1,unusual book
616,5,Steve Whiteford artfully condenses all of the EQ types into easy to understand language an real world examples for each type.  This is an excellent resource for beginners as well as people who want a quick refresher course.  A must have manuel for anyone interested in Emotional Intelligence.
617,5,Awesome series. It is one of the series of books my youngest daughter will read.  She has a hard time finding books that she likes.
618,2,"The amount you pay for this makes it really not worth it. It's good quality, but you're better off buying the compendium if you're looking more for amount to read than a quality package. It didn't have covers inside for the different volumes and I thought there should be an index of where each issue or volume starts. Also note that there are only 4 volumes in this, and they are talking about 24 issues. There is a difference. I saw another user rating this low because of a misunderstanding of that and I feel that they should  make the difference more clear for people who are new to the comic world and started reading because of interest in the show."
619,5,"Finally completed both (this and the isc(2) official guide this past week and wanted to get my thoughts together to do a comprehensive review.  First up Mr. Easttom's all-in-one book, I found Mr. Easttom's book to be a very quick and concise read.  It got its points across and as a reader and someone experienced with the topics I both understood and was able to relate to what was being discussed.  My only concern was that I felt that it was TOO understanding, meaning that I felt as though I was able to get the topics too easily.  This unease lead me to purchase the official book with Peter Stephenson as the lead author.  This book was quite different.  I felt that Mr. Stephenson's book was not a easy read.  The book did not have a thematic flow in that it felt disjointed by the weight of many voices having input in the final product.  Better editing could've helped with this.  It had an air of academia in that it took a long mile to explain a concept that could've been explained by a quick block."
620,5,I thoroughly enjoyed this book in this spectacular series!
621,5,"This book was so helpful to me.  If you or anyone you know who has lost someone to violence I recommend this book.  I can't begin to explain the trauma and grief the family and close friends go through; and it never seems to stop.  This book has helped me understand that my feelings are normal, my emotions and continual sadness are okay, and there are others out there like me.  It's also a lifesaver in the description of what to expect with the judicial system.  I can't thank the author enough for writing this."
622,5,Good story....the power of one. History with true events.
623,5,Always loved this series of books
624,5,Fits great<br />I get a lot of poeple asking where I bought it.
625,5,love it!!! fast shipping. would buy from again.
626,5,"I’d  like to thank the Davis family for allowing us a glimpse into the nightmare that was their lives for 22 years. I’d also like to thank Jen Marlowe for seeing this project through until the end. I cannot imagine what it was like for her to become a part of the Davis’ lives, beginning this project with Martina and Troy, and having to finish it alone. I couldn’t fathom what it was like for the Davis’ fighting for Troy’s life; hoping that the system that has sworn to protect their citizens, would protect Troy. While reading this book, I shared some of the sentiments held by some of the Savannah residents affected by this case. Although we are supposed to believe that the law is designed to protect us, the acts committed against minorities prove otherwise.<br /><br />I am angry. Not only for what happened to Troy, but what has happened to other victims of our unjust system. I am angry that the callousness for human life has victimized not only those who have died at the hands of our system, but the families and friends who will never get another glimpse of their loved one, a kiss, a hug, nor another moment. I am afraid that something like this could happen to someone I love or even me. I am saddened to know that there are children who will grow up and very well likely be another casualty. But I am also proud; proud that through it all, this family stuck together and have brought attention to this cause like no other movement before it. I am proud that instead of becoming bitter, the Davis family chose love and that love was exemplary in their activism<br /><br />I am forever changed by the Davis’ story."
627,4,Giving it for a gift.
628,1,Only helpful for very specific jobs in top firms. Better off just doing the firm's cases they have on their websites (such as Deloitte does) and networking with company employees to see the types of questions asked.
629,4,intersting read was a great time in my youth went to washington twice to picket this dude when i was in high school.
630,1,"NO NO NO NO NO, MILLION NO's.  &#34;BRAT&#34; is a subculture.  Not a term to be made &#34;politically correct&#34; because you civilians THINK you are offended.  Quit lining your pockets.  And SHAME ON THE USO/Red CROSS and other sponsors."
631,5,"The comics were carefully selected and beautifully reproduced. The addition of a foreword is just great. I've loved Ernie Bushmiller's Nancy comic all my life, but I appreciate the clean lines and unique graphic style more so now as an adult. I'm glad these collections are available for purchase on Amazon."
632,5,good book
633,5,Fascinating autobiography about one of the world's most important leaders
634,5,Absolut stunning book even for beginners to start with shibori as well to admire  traditional and modern ways of this interesting technique .
635,5,thank-you
636,5,"This was a great read!  It kept my attention the entire time and I did not want to put it down. We picked this book for our book club, everyone enjoyed reading it!"
637,5,I have been waiting for the book that scientifically links the physical world and the spiritual world.  A book that proves to science that God does exist. That miracles are abundant and that the root issue of every illness or challenge is karma.  Here it is folks. The proof!  Read it! Benefit from it! Transform your soul heart mind and body! Believe! ❤️
638,5,Great book with a lot of insight that challenged me to pursue God for my own personal revival.
639,5,"Dr. Graham is the Godfather of elementary physical education.  All you need to know is in this book, regardless if you have taught for 20 years or are starting your first methods class."
640,5,"One of the most SOLID inspirational, motivational, faith filled books I have ever read. I bought it for Kindle, and then I had to buy the print copy, as well. Women/mothers can relate to Rosalind's struggles with faith during the hard times. In the end, this book is a gift of perspective to Christians everywhere."
641,5,"This is a good and informative book on an intro to Bitcoin, but it also just touches upon altcoins. The author does touch upon crypto 2.0 technologies like ethereum, but he seems to have missed one major player in this crypto 2.0 space, NXT (nxtcoin). From my research, NXT seems to be the most developed and innovative crypto as of today, but it does not have the marketing exposure of other coins like ethereum. If you do your research on NXT and ethereum, you'll notice the magnitude of development on one compared to the other."
642,5,"A beautiful cookbook filled with photographs of the entire regions, it's people and traditions, these recipes are as close to the real deal as you will get. As the name says, a BEAUTIFUL Cookbook, you learn about the place and not just the platters."
643,5,perfect!
644,5,Love this book!  Gave me new appreciation for donkeys.
645,5,Excellent book.
646,5,I attended a class where this book was used from which to teach.  I need to go back and reread it to refresh  my memory.  Dillon did an wonderful job translating the book of Song of Solomon.  Hebrew poetry is nothing like English poetry.  An excellent read.
647,4,awesome book
648,4,Cute book!  My daughter's preschool reads this to her all of the time so I had to find this book!  The plastic inside tears easily though but nothing that clear tape can't fix.  My daughter is pretty rough on it.  Recommend!
649,4,Love the Alexander books - almost as much as my grandson!
650,4,Love it some really great recipes especially the Crab Cakes
651,4,"There is a reason this author has sold ten of thousands of books: He can tell a story.  In this one, he manages to mix the genres of time travel and historical fiction.  The story of two modern day American astronauts at the Battles of Lexington and Concord during the American Revolution is just as captivating as the story of how they got there...(and back?)"
652,5,Covers everything.
653,5,Great
654,5,"Great gift idea for those who love eating at the Hill!  This book has great stories, pictures, and recipes. I like how each recipe also has a picture of the meal. Looking forward to trying some out!"
655,5,Nice book; significant other loves it.
656,2,a bit basic for my middle school students
657,5,Informative
658,3,"Sarney, a great writer, right? Look, his books have been translated into French etc ...<br /><br />Well, in a way. These are all short pieces published the newspaper, and all dealing with politics. Sarney the politician is, well, something else.<br /><br />But that's not to say that the book is worthless. Sarney as a politician isn't so much bad as he's a mere time-server; he's just an old hold-over of the old social order in his home northern state (kind of like &#34;southern&#34; in the USA) of Maranha, and really represents nothing beyond going-along-with-whatever-comes-along. Tending toward conservatism, as far as ideology goes. The politics expressed in the book, however, tends toward to the nebulous. When he starts talking about culture, though, he can be quite insightful, e.g. his remark in the first selection (he's meeting with a French intellectual who's trying to protect French culture and language) that Brazil has gone from a verbal culture to a visual culture (i.e. TV); it missed the book. And, all aside from the validity of this statement for Brazil, any American will reflect, as frequently while reading this book, that Sarney could be talking about America.<br /><br />These pieces are all from the Nineties."
659,4,Good information. Some of the recomendations are to expensive for the average person to afford.
660,5,"Excellent, but very scholarly. Not casual reading."
661,5,Great book. Great patterns. I would recommend this to everyone. Thanks.
662,5,"There are points in here that are vague/too complex for even a home DIY mechanic to perform, but overall this is a solid buy for keeping the Corolla online. For common stuff I used this book, and Paul's Travel Pictures online (google it, its got the best corolla repair guides for beginners)"
663,4,Still reading this but so far so good.  Hope it picks up speed soon.  Grisham seems to write only for the money and movie rights rather than for the excellent stories he used to write about.
664,5,I needed it for school
665,1,"I you don't want to read a book by a racist, then don't read this one.  It was evident at the start of the book that what this guy, as is most racists are afraid of...not EMP, but young black men...they somehow think that in the event of and EMP, hordes of black men with their pants riding low, their gold teeth, and their urban slang will overpower them and take their property, their wives, and their ford pickups.  Shortly after the book starts, the main character runs into the previous mentioned black guys and they try to steal his backpack spouting racial slurs using some kind of slave gutter talk that only someone who don't know anything about blacks would think they would use.  I knew it wouldn't take long to run into the N word at which point I had planned to throw this POS in its proper place....It didn't take long at all....and in the trash it went....I am glad I didn't buy this trash."
666,5,I probably can't remember.  That sums up this book soooo ......
667,5,"I learned about this graphic memoir while editing a bibliography of graphic works of ethnic interest, and was intrigued enough to seek it out at the library. Thoroughly delightful; one feels like they are there with Briggs' parents, Ethel and Ernest, during some everyday events of their rich lives together.<br /><br />It reminded me of the Classic comics I loved as a child--you were learning some history while the images enhanced the human interest aspect greatly. I bought this as a birthday present for my (Irish) sister-in-law, who grew up in England in the 1940's-1960's."
668,5,"This was a gift for a friend.  If you like June Jordan, then this is a great collection of her essays."
669,5,Yummy&#34;
670,3,"Sebastian is a 12 year old boy in 1973. He is bullied by his parents and at school. The only person who was ever there for him, his brother Flynn, died 2 years ago. But he has this amazing abilities to dream. Not just regular dreams either. He is destined to help Hibercadia. How is a boy with low self esteem supposed to help?<br />With the help of his amazing odd ball friends, he might just be able to.<br />This book opened up so sad. This poor boy is in so many horrible situations. He still has the ability to dream of someplace else despite the horridness of his life. The story moves a slow at the beginning. The first half was a lot of set up for the second half. Its good for understanding purposes. I just felt it could have been done at a quicker pace. If you stick by until the second half (which you should) you will not regret it!<br />I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."
671,5,Love this book.  Have been looking for differnt block patterns in different sizes.  This book has it all in one place.
672,4,Good book about a boy whose dad carves the poles.
673,5,This is another good series by Janet Lambert.
674,5,Nice little book with great illustrations.
675,4,I love cookbooks and this really follows the southern style.  If you like southern cooking you will love this book.
676,5,Super product
677,5,Dragon Eyes is an endearing book that has a strong moral message woven into the story of a dragon and a girl. This is a book that your kids will return to again and again to enjoy the beautiful pictures of the lovable dragon. And you will be happy knowing that the principles they are learning from the story are a great foundation to guide the formation of all-important values in growing minds.
678,3,"It's rare that a book completely fails to capture either of my little bibliophiles, but \\""The Cat...\\"" managed.  It's not the overly-simple story or the comic-style art, it's the lackluster writing that really did it in for us.<br /><br />\\""The Cat...\\"" is basically a cat telling a dog the story of Little Red Riding Hood, and seems to be built around the joke about why the wolf would go through so much effort to trick Red when he could've just eaten her on the path in the first place.  True.  But you know how your 5-year-old likes to interrupt the story to ask umpteen questions?  (No, is that just my kids?)  So \\""The Cat...\\"" is pretty much written just like that.  Except that my 4yo ALSO likes to cut in and ask.  So I have the story moving at a crawl because the in-book characters are asking 4th-wall questions, while it moves even slower because my 4yo also wanted to ask questions (and didn't quite grasp the concept).<br /><br />I think \\""The Cat...\\"" is a cool concept, and I think the artwork is manageable, I just think there are some better 4th-wall picture books out there, chief among them being David Wiesner's \\""[[ASIN:0618007016 The Three Little Pigs]]\\"".  It's a fun genre, this just isn't a particularly fun book in it."
679,5,"I loved reading this book and practicing the various suggestions and the physical exercises as well.  The chapter on breathing was my favorite and I have gotten a lot of that chapter and I have been consciously using all the exercises and have been totally feeling the effects of these as well.  The author Pam Free has so effectively brought it forth to use something so natural and vital, yet, something that we take so for granted, and use it most consciously and  for it to bear the utmost fruit for the wellness of ones body and mind.  Thus, all in all, it is a book one must read and take it seriously and use it for ones own good."
680,5,"I read &#34;Illegal to Legal&#34; and was amazed at the ability of a single book to provide a clear path to success for anyone that has been incarcerated. The author is well aware of the additional obstacles that face each individual that wants to start a business after being released from prison.<br />I personally recommend this book to anyone that has a loved one currently incarcerated. This book gives the one thing that is almost priceless in prison and that is hope. After reading &#34;Illegal to Legal&#34; you realize that hope can turn into reality if you just don't give up and focus on the skills you have had all along, but never realized.<br /><br />J Musso<br />Founder of TAP-X<br />Truth About Prison - Network"
681,4,"I was given this book for an honest review<br /><br />4 stars.<br /><br />This is such an emotional roller coaster that it kept so wrapped up in the characters that you didn't want it to end. Let's start with jaz. She has had such a rough childhood that she has lost all faith in men. The abuse she and her mom had gone through was so saddening. Jaz is such a strong woman. And she doesn't realize it. I love how the has had her grow throughout the book, you see the girl she was to the woman she becomes. The author did a fantastic job with that. Mason was your typical man @@@@@@ at the beginning, but with what happens within his life, the author let's him grow into a absolutely wonderful man. What these two had to endure during their lives it is incredible that they found each other. I love how their lives intertwine without them knowing it at the beginning and how it wasn't perfect so they had o work at their relationship. Blake has to be one of the sweetest kids that you will read about in a book. He has real feelings and he just is not a fill in character for a book. He has been through so much that it tugs at the heartstrings.<br /><br />I love what this author did with this book and can't wait to read something else from her. Sent from my NOOK"
682,5,"This is part Steelers history, part beer history, part travel guide and part humour. It really gives the reader a bit of everything.<br /><br />We get to go in a roadtrip to 100 bars in a 5 month period to see what makes the Steeler fans special.<br /><br />Well worth a fans time. It also helps that the authors appear to be genuine good guys"
683,5,"Arrived in good time, well-wrapped, but I thought it was  to be hard-cover version.  Otherwise  book to be highly recommended and one I expect to reorder."
684,5,Good quality product for a good price.
685,4,The book is suited for bread bakers who'd like to understand the underlying principles and get hints for personal improvement of their technoques.
686,5,They are ok
687,5,Good condition
688,2,"I'm not happy with this book at all. Although it is very detailed, it's almost detailed to a fault. They introduce acronyms without even specifying what they stand for or what they mean! Although the information is very dense, it has an underlying expectation of extremely well-versed medical jargon and background knowledge.<br /><br />I find myself looking up dozens of terms each chapter. The book does have some great collections of clinical signs and symptoms, which I do appreciate. However, each page is so poorly thought out and doesn't flow in a way that makes it easily comprehensible. Hate it, and I want to burn it..if only I didn't rent it, and if only I didn't need it for my class."
689,5,"when I visited Gettysburg previously I did not pay much attention to the monuments . I thought they were works of sculpture.  I now know they are placed at the locations at which the troops they commemorate fought.  As such this is an excellent guide book to follow the battle IF you are familiar with the battle from reading about it in historical overview books, or even from Killer Angels or the movie Gettysburg. this book wont mean much to the beginning visitor to the battlefield who is not knowledgeable about the details of the battle.. Excellent for the expert or intermediate Gettysburg buff."
690,3,"This is a difficult review to tackle.  I do not know a lot about the political history of the region, so I am assuming the author is correct.  This is a book that is also a journey - there is a reason for its length need to follow through page after page to understand the entire concept the author is portraying."
691,4,"Having worked in nonprofits for many years, I found this book on target. I'd like to see a new edition pick up where this left off."
692,4,"I strongly recommend this workbook as you are preparing/studying for the EA exams. It is wonderful that you are able to time yourself so you have an idea of how long the real exam will take you, and also get a general feel of how much you know the material. I wish there were more than two tests for each section, but two is better than none. Like the study guides, i was disappointed in the overall quality if the material. In the introduction to the workbook, it clearly states that none of the questions in the workbook are duplicates of the questions in the study guides. But i found several duplicates.  Not superior quality, but good enough to pass the exams. Price is nice."
693,3,"This is a good quick-read study book that gives a good basic overview of topics for the psychiatry shelf.  There were a few typos here and there in this edition (grammar/spelling rather than factual) and the authors used the &#34;--&#62;&#34; arrow liberally whenever &#34;leads to&#34; was meant, both of which made for awkward reading at times."
694,4,"This guide is great for updating prices quickly if your not looking for too much accuracy.  Some of the disadvantages include: not making clear numbering of prices of blocks, strips, pairs  and not listing BOB items currently like airmails etc.<br />Basically it's a good guide for a quick update."
695,4,"Follows the destinies of two young people in Central Nigeria. Strong parental disapproval, one family very wealthy, strongly political and Christian, the other very military, now merchants and Muslim, set against the backdrop of civil and political unrest, fuelled by conflicting religions, kept coming between them. Happily love conquers all."
696,5,Grandson loved it
697,5,Fascinating oral history.
698,5,"This is an excellent book, especially for people who have a child with disabilities. It is heartwarming and has a strong religious tone to it.<br />I would highly recommend it."
699,5,"This book was awesome to read, l was given an copy to review for Mary Moriarty, you will love this story about the misadventures of Emma, the fire starter who has a little bit of a witch in her, she's adorable, funny and this was a delight to read....love the story and this author has a way of telling a story that won't disappoint you, so go buy this book and a ride with this adorable witch....."
700,4,"The Steve Treseler Group -- a flexible quintet/sextet with a revolving cast of musicians -- is a showcase for Treseler's arsenal of reeds and the marvelous trumpet playing of the criminally under-recorded Ingrid Jensen. Their music comes in four flavors: freely improvised miniatures, through-composed art songs (including \\""Days Were Golden\\"" by the '90s emo band Sunny Day Real Estate), modal workouts (including Jensen's Woody Shaw-like \\""Center Song\\""), and more traditional jazz tunes, including a blazing version of \\""Kary's Trance\\"" (Lee Konitz) and \\""Cold Hammered,\\"" a hard bop piece that I thought had been lifted from a '50s Blue Note album 'til I saw that Treseler had written it. All over the musical map, then, but still a very good album worthy of your time as a listener."
701,5,What I needed and arrived on time.
702,2,"I kind of appreciate some of the modern scholarship such as White's blowing the whistle on a lot of what Yoga has become, however at the same time it is missing so much in its analysis. Some others have pointed out the fact that much of this knowledge was more heavily transmitted by oral means and no amount of textual study will give you insight into either what these texts are talking about nor their history - try as you may.IF you want a look at the problems of western scholarship in understanding yoga proper outside of tradition, check out baba ram puri's website, who is a westerner that has lived in as a traditional sadhu but can articulate many things that western academia would rather not consider in their \\""objectivity\\""....  Also in my own studies with lineages of Jyotish for example, the core text that gives the entire basics of the discipline of Jyotish was largely lost for many centuries save for the outskirts and fringes of Brahmin families leaving little recorded history of the text, but still it is the cornerstone of that discipline which is only currently being revived for various reasons. No amount of narcissistic white boy scholarship is going to be able to understand any of this if they can't even get into the temple. If your interested in yoga, pray that God sends you to a real teacher, tread lightly on people who have read stack fulls of books and think they know the whole story about anything ancient, and maybe stay away from yoga studios while your at it. That should help a little."
703,5,Great book - very sad story
704,5,"I've had the book for over a week but was only able to get to it the other day because every time I went to read it one of my family members was busy leafing through the pages chuckling.  First off, it's a visually beautiful book.  More importantly, it is chock full of humor, insight, and very good food.  Pashman's semi-serious mock earnest tone and attention to detail are delightful.  Nearly every page will produce several smiles, chuckles, guffaws, and hunger pangs.  This book has made my Christmas shopping significantly easier this year."
705,5,I own all of Diana's books.  The fiery cross is just as enthrawling as they all are.  Highly recommend to anyone who wants to take an amazing journey.
706,5,A great read! I loved the suspense and mystery involved and definitely would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys those genres as well!
707,5,"VERY nice book. Cover is thick, and all the pages are very thick and very colorful. He loves it. Easy for flip-through reading - lots of tidbits. Glad I bought it - very good quality and content."
708,5,This is a must read for every high school and college student. Too many people coming out of school and don't have a clue how important life and liberty is to all men. Wished I had read this 40 years ago.
709,5,Good info
710,5,The book just won an award from the very prestigious French group Demeures Historiques.
711,4,"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie Tales<br /><br />Quick & Dirty: All Lined Up is one of those stories that makes you wish you could fall in love all over again!!! I loved everything about this story and can’t wait to read more from this series!<br /><br />Opening Sentence: In Texas, two things are cherished above all else—football and gossip.<br /><br />The Review:<br /><br />Dallas Cole has spent her the last few years of her life trying to get away from football. Growing up she was raised by her single father that had a career as a football coach. They moved around every few years whenever there was a new coaching opportunity. Then she ended up dating football players and that also never turned out well, so Dallas has decided to swear off anything that has to do with football. She thought that college would be her chance to start over, but instead of being able to go to her dream college to study dance her father convinces her to stay close to home and attend Rusk University. Her father also happens to be the new head football coach so it seems that college is going to be a repeat of high school. Then Dallas meets Carson at a random party and it seems that maybe things won’t be as bad as she thought. But as luck would have it, Carson is the backup quarterback and Dallas has promised herself that she will never make the mistake of dating another football player.<br /><br />Carson McClain has just transferred to Rusk University in hopes of eventually getting a football scholarship. He comes from a poor family and has never really been all that great at school. Pretty much the only thing he has ever been good at is football so to prove that he deserves to be first string, he works harder than anyone else. He doesn’t have time for distractions, especially not the kind that comes in the form of a beautiful redhead that happens to be the coach’s daughter. But no matter how hard he tries he just can’t seem to stay away and it may cost him everything he has worked for.<br /><br />I totally loved Dallas, she was a very easy character to love and connect with. She is brutally honest and doesn’t take crap from anyone, which I really admired. She was an easy person to sympathize with and some of the things she deals with were similar to things I dealt with when I was her age. I also really loved the relationship she had with her father, it reminded me a lot of the relationship I had with my own father growing up, which made me understand her on a deeper level. She also had some faults like the fact that she let some of her past experiences keep her from letting people into her life because she was afraid of getting hurt again. But as the story progressed you got to see her open up and discover so much about herself. In a lot of ways this was a coming of age story for her and I really enjoyed reading about her journey.<br /><br />Carson pretty much had me at hello. From the moment I met him, I was completely taken with how sexy and sweet he was. His work ethic was crazy good and the determination he had to succeed even when the odds were against him made me really respect him. Also, the way he treated Dallas was adorable. They had amazing sexual chemistry but they also were very compatible in a lot of other ways as well. I am going to admit that Carson reminds me a lot of my husband because not only does my husband have blue eyes and dark hair, his name also happens to be Karson. But that’s not the only reason I liked him, but it obviously didn’t hurt! I think he was the perfect love interest and I totally swooned over him!<br /><br />All Lined Up was a beautiful story that really captured the whole experience of discovering yourself and falling in love for the first time. From the first page I was hooked and I loved pretty much everything about this story. Personally, I am a huge college football fan so of course that was a huge plus for me. I also really enjoy all the different relationships that were explored throughout the book. While the romance was a huge part of the story, it wasn’t the only plot point present. Speaking of the romance, it was done perfectly. It developed slowly and realistically, but it was also full of tension and drama. This is actually my first book by Carmack but rest assured it will not be my last. I can’t wait to dive into the companion novel that is coming out this fall!!!  Suffice to say this was a great read and I would highly recommend it to all new adult contemporary romance fans!<br /><br />Notable Scene:<br /><br />“Oh, Daredevil,” he murmurs. “I like you.”<br /><br />I like it when he calls me that. My stomach swoops low in my belly in approval and anticipation.<br /><br />This time, I kiss him, and his lips press back against mine so hard that a jolt of something coils down my spine. The hand at the back of my neck tightens, and his hand rests lightly against my knee. I know he must feel it shaking.<br /><br />I can’t decide if him being a virtual stranger makes this kind of intimacy more or less terrifying.<br /><br />His lips open against mine, his breath fanning over my skin, and I think more terrifying, definitely.<br /><br />FTC Advisory:  William Morrow/Harper Collins provided me with a copy of All Lined Up.

712,3,"This book felt a bit forced and irrational, and I liked it least of the series. I guess I'm not game for how the mystery panned out. The tension was well-created, and the writing and character development was good, but the storyline was a bit lackluster.  If you're into the series, go for it, it's not BAD. It's just the one that I liked least, which is inevitable (having a part you like least), when you consider that you have eight books in a series. Some stand out for the good reasons, others fall flat."
713,4,"The author has travelled a considerable amount and made the effort to meet people in marginal areas leading cultural lifestyles out of step with today's world. He mentions having been in China thirty years ago and the changes since. We see nomadic herders, fishermen, mountain dwellers and bird-catchers, everywhere from Mongolia to Finland to Australia.<br /><br />I commend the author for recording these ways of life, and noting difficulties such as strip mining or industry which encroach on their lands.<br /><br />However I would have liked to see some suggestions from him as to how modern life can make improvements. Living on the fringe of civilisation would be cold, painful, hungry, physically strenuous, risky and isolating. There would be early deaths, especially for pregnant women, and high infant mortality. The role of women is not considered by the author, but these family-raisers would have unsanitary water and random access to food and clothing. With ever more water supplies being bought up by water-selling companies, how will some of these basic lifestyles persist? And is this a fair way to bring up children?<br /><br />Options not considered by the author are available. Compromise allows people to live the way they choose, with modern assistance and contact.<br />The Turkish government gives grants to shepherds for solar panels which are carried on donkeys, in order for them to power up laptops.  Cellphones, charged by solar panels worn on a backpack, may carry an app to diagnose eye diseases such as cataract and glaucoma on the spot, so doctors can provide targeted treatment to remote areas. The charity UNICEF uses public transport and local staff to provide vaccines and education in the remotest areas of the world. An origami microscope made of paper with inbuilt lenses and LED light source, can be used to diagnose diseases such as malaria. No such solutions are offered by Jules Pretty however; the author merely records his observations. For this reason I suggest that THE EDGE OF EXTINCTION should be read along with a look at what useful, light technology can do to reduce isolation and provide healthcare.I suggest that THE EDGE OF EXTINCTION should be read along with a look at what useful, light technology can do to reduce isolation and provide healthcare."

716,1,"Being a Michigan fan and have read many books about Michigan, this by far is the worse. Rosenberg is an outsider and should not be covering Michigan at all. He's long been a guy all about displaying negative things about the university. This book was compete garbage. Many other books about this rivalry that are way better."
717,5,Classic!

719,4,Really held my attention and kept me guessing.Loved it!!
720,5,Good book
721,5,PERFECT
722,2,I bought it for my Grandson's 1st birthday.  I was so disappointed with the illustrations.  The story was not really very entertaining either.  I'm actually not sure I'll even give the book to Owen.
723,5,"I was very psyched about reading this book! I saw the cover and just felt compelled to read it. There are some parts of the book that are just jaw-dropping to me. I like the way the author describes each character and how she makes their personalities just leap off the page. You can really imagine them based on the people around us. I like this book even more because it’s based on events that maybe could actually happen. The way the two girls can get caught up in social services and all their new things that they have to learn and adjust to. Over all, its just plain amazing and I would run to the ends of the earth to read this book again."
724,5,great read
725,5,Beautiful book. Essential for any childʻs library. Winnie-the-Pooh is deep.
726,5,"I just finished reading &#34;True Healing&#34; and I found it incredibly relevant, practical... and yes, healing. I read the book during one of my many frustrating moments with chronic fatigue, did all the meditations practices and came out the other side with a very clear , meaningful and significant path to follow.<br /><br />I am a professional seeker by nature - but being a native New Yorker, I am discerning. I really need spiritual information to stand and walk in the real world. Alison Anton accomplished this and seems to have a gift for conveying and synthesizing esoteric information into an experiential read.<br /><br />&#34;True Healing&#34; is a true gift to the world."
727,5,The way our world should be embraced.  Wonderful book.
728,5,The exercises in this workbook are very helpful and complement the text well. It gives more meaning and application to the material in the textbook. It also helps to go back to the text and reread the section after completing the exercises.
729,5,I enjoyed this book very much.  I read for entertainment and enjoy all of Ms. Palmer's books.
730,5,"[[VIDEOID:mo3JTE5TH03KNLJ]]As a big fan of the Harry Potter novels and films, I think this book this a fantastic one to own.  \\""Page to Screen\\"" chronicles the entire 10-year production of the Harry Potter movie franchise.<br /><br />Everything about the movies is discussed -- including in-depth looks at the characters, locations, and various stories of the making of the movies.  Author Bob McCabe does a great job highlighting the challenges of the production, the technical and creative innovations, and the visual/artistic achievements.  I would say that my appreciation for the films increased after reading this book.  In particular, the visual elements (costumes, props, set design, creature makeup, etc) of the movies are discussed in detail.  It also helps that the book contains tons of high-resolution color images - including photos from the set.<br /><br />It's a wonderful book that is a must-own.  Highly recommended!<br /><br />NOTE: This book is also available as part of a collector's set (which you might be interested in): [[ASIN:1612185916 Harry Potter Page to Screen: The Complete Filmmaking Journey (Collector's Edition)]]"
731,1,"Wow. Not wanting to give the author money until I knew if this was a good book or not, I borrowed a copy from my local library. This book is fantasist nonsense which, if followed, is a very good way of increasing your child's chances of burial prior to adolescence.<br /><br />Yes, the author does give references, but they are references to either junk science, long-since disproved or to opinion pieces with absolutely no evidence to back them up.<br /><br />Just because someone has gone and written something down, does not make it real - see Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings for more information.<br /><br />If you truly value your child's health, please do not follow this author's truly awful and dangerous advice."
732,5,Was blessed by this book and did have a blessed birth experience.  I am very grateful that Jackie Mize wrote this.
733,5,Great book. Fast shipping. I'm very pleased with my purchase.
734,5,Great book
735,2,The bind is already coming apart despite being brand new and being very careful with it.  I am very disappointed in the quality.  Don't waste your money.
736,4,"This book was I was very interesting indeed. It really was just a lovely book. It had so much Japanese history in it, which also made me want to know and read more about it. Throughout the book it had me wanting to know more and more. And the characters, well they are just amazing and very developed. I felt like I knew them well by the end of the novel. The author also reminded us how friendship and relationship can be so fragile but so amazing too. And how it is never to late to forgive.<br /><br />Throughout the book, it goes back and forth. From when one of the characters was a younger person, to that person being older. It goes from the 1940's to the 1980's. It goes back and forth a couple times, but it always keeps you engaged into it. Each chapter in this novel is giving us the characters viewpoints and Jaime Ford really expresses how the characters feels too. Like you can really understand and feel how the characters are feeling too, like you are really there in the book with them.<br /><br />This novel is about never giving up and always looking at the brighter side of things. Even in the darkest of nights. Always having hope. It is  About how 2 families, One Chinese the other Japanese, always having trouble throughout the book but also looking at the bright side of things. There are also other characters in the novel. But I wont ruin that for you. I would defiantly recommend this book to anyone. It is really good and always keeps you wanting more. Especially if you want to know more history."
737,1,A book about abusing/killing animals.
738,5,Love it.
739,5,Parts of it are in error but that's due to the FAA postponing changes already in print.
740,5,"Every time I pick up this book, I find some new information. Almost every paragraph has something new and worthwhile to learn.<br /><br />A fantastic book and an amazing resource. If you are interested in this topic, you will not find a better book.<br /><br />I will be ordering the 3rd edition very shortly."
741,5,"Couldn't put it down. You can randomly open to any page and start reading. A lot of the backroom stories about inventory companies, different levels of management, good and bad co-workers and customers can apply to a lot more than actual public retail businesses. Learned a lot about the relationship between a mall and the mall cops and the stores and employees, recovery and what's really in the stockroom.  Some of his experiences with people and corporate rules are truly bizarre, but I have lived a lot of it; I've never worked in public store type retail but have actually experienced the bizarre rite of destroying written off merchandise so no one can take it. A really fun read. Also interesting to see the early days of his Retail comic strip, it looked a little different, it seems all cartoonists don't settle into a set way of drawing until after the first couple years.  I can only imagine not liking this book if you're one of the \\""people\\"" types he talks about"
742,5,Good book.  First one I've read by this author.
743,4,A little dated but good informaton
744,5,"For me, this book seemed very similar to many other similar self-empowerment style books.<br /><br />However, the more I read, the deeper the author delved into what really separates these great achievers to the normal people. These aren't necessarily qualities that you haven't heard of before. But rather, they are explicitly defined in a strategic order to help open your mind to areas in your life that you might not be operating at your full potential.<br /><br />The last few chapters for me are what really made the book gold for me. It really ties together everything that we've been taught in our lives by society, and shows it to you from a third-person perspective. This in-turn makes you realize some of the biggest barriers society puts in your way of success."
745,1,This book is so worthless it's actually amazing that there were two professors who agreed to write such convoluted crap AND that it got past editors.
746,5,"really fine evocation of a soul sorting through a troubling set of formative circumstances.  i read it straight thru last night & was moved & a little disturbed & against my better judgement aroused.  engrossing, emotional poetry, spare & concise - the poems work well separately but also all together as a kind of verse novella - you hang on as the two stories become one.  i will be revisiting it..."
747,5,Simple and cute children's book. Love the illustrations.
748,5,This book is wonderful. I had the pleasure to read the rough copy and it blew me away. waiting on part 2. Nycula Robinson
749,2,"Regarding the biographical objective of this book I cannot help but point out that I have gotten more detailed and succinct information on Imhotep from any run of the mill encyclopedias; and even Wikipedia. Granted, some of the astronomical information and the description of the architectural and astronomical significances of 'the Step Pyramid Complex' of Pharaoh Djoser, were  interesting. But I didn't buy the book to read about that. I feel that Robert Bauval's stream is running dry after the first successes with works such as \\""The Message of the Sphinx\\"",\\""The Orion Mystery\\"" and \\""Talisman\\"". I cannot recommend this book for readers who are in search of groundbreaking information about the first 'Da Vinci' of history: Imhotep."
750,1,"An incongruous and confusing mix of mystery, horror, and Jewish mysticism.  After a while not only did I not know what was going on, but I didn't care.  I'm not sure why I finished it, except that I've been a big fan of Jonathan Kellerman's Alex Delaware novels.  He should stick to them."
751,5,Well written.  Keeps you interested;  I don't want to put it down.
752,4,"New York FBI Agent Aiden Mahoney is the newest Krewe member. He awakens from a dream where his friend Richard Highsmith calls out to him. The next morning he is assigned his first case with the Krewe and finds himself heading to Sleepy Hollow where his friend Richard was reported missing last night. Here we meet Maureen Deauville and her dog Rollo. The two work as a team finding lost people and have a unique talent. Unfortunately, she has found Richard, well his head at any rate. It is perched atop the statue of the Headless Horseman. The tale that unfolds has suspects galore, with clever twists and turns as these two work together to stop a killer.<br /><br />The mystery aspect was solid, and Graham weaved in ghostly aspirations to assist us. Aiden struggles accepting his abilities, and we see growth in him as his friendship with Maureen “Mo” grows. The romance was very low-key, but you felt the attraction. My only complaint would be I wanted more of a buildup, and a little heat exchanged throughout the plot. Most of the romantic elements took place at the end of the novel. Since, the murders were so captivating it didn’t detract from my overall enjoyment. I enjoyed the way Graham weaved in local history and famous characters in the tale. Her description of the rural area, characters and ghosts kept me entertained. The setting in Betrayed made the tale perfect for Fall and had me longing for cocoa by the fire.

754,2,"I have long found useful the earlier bilingual edition published in Taiwan. This one, though attractive prodiced, uses only simplified characters, though nowhere announces this fact.<br />This greatly reduces its value<br />Chinese ancient classics should be studied with traditional characters."
755,5,Expands your thinking. Absolutely recommended for all.
756,1,"I had such high expectations for this book, if for no other reason than the fact that it was on Oprah's list. Unfortunately, I was terribly disappointed, and ended up reading a lackluster novel. It was an interesting concept to explore (Catholic guilt meets quasi-feminism), but a true resolution was never realized, and the characters were never fully developed."
757,5,Awesome book! It will really help you!

762,5,"We can't imagine the culinary arts without spices and herbs and Ian and Kate Hamphill's &#34;Bible&#34; is a well-researched work worthy of adding to your cook's library. We especially like the fact that there are practical recipes included with each spice and herb entry so you are not just reading dry information but can put a particular spice or herb to good use in a specific dish. We even came across entries we had never heard about before such as Huacatay, Saltbush and Mastic, so be prepared to extend your edification when reading this comprehensive guidebook."

772,4,"Seeing the cover and title, I wanted this book right away but I hesitated because I was looking for more perfume and less World War II. Finally, I bought the book and I am glad I did. Though there is not much about perfume, the story is quite interesting and keeps one entertained as it switches from one time period to another. You really have to pay attention to keep track of what is going on, with multiple related stories going on at the same time. The main character was not very likable and I kept forgetting her name, but Eva was well-developed. In addition to the many misspellings and grammar issues, I believe there were some terms used incorrectly: as far as I know, there is no aquiver tree. It should have been aquilaria tree. Also, though there is little about actual perfume in this book, and certainly not much refers to the title  of actual perfume collecting, it was a little forced the way the author used perfume terms. I felt she was going for the obvious &#34;strange&#34; explanations of perfume ingredients such as ambergris, civet and oudh. This might sound interesting to a perfume novice but certainly fools no one who truly knows perfume. Imagine, a perfume that uses both oudh and ambergris! I highly doubt a skilled perfumer would use both in a composition. Additionally, the obscure part about Kay Waverley was not brought to it's full potential. I am still left questioning if I know what happened there. I imagine I know but don't want to spoil it for others. All in all, a very enjoyable book full of twists and turns, time periods and a bit of perfuming. Apart from the glaring typos and slow pace towards the end of the book, a most enjoyable read."
773,5,This book inspired me to start studying herbalism. It's so easy to read and understand. I only wish there were follow on books with more herbs!

782,5,"Over the course of almost thirty years-teaching, within my home parish, about the adult christian faith journey-I have read many books by and about Thomas Merton-some I have read twice. Recently, I finished 'Sophia' for the fourth time and know there is so much more I have yet to grasp within the pages of this masterpiece of the soul. Once again, as Merton and Pramuk have stated, I am reminded that one must 'live one's theology' if you seek to understand it. 'Sophia' sends you into the depths of the world, and in doing so, discover the gentle embrace of the humble Christ all around you, hidden in plain sight."
783,4,"I read this book way back early in the summer after meeting the author at a booth at a local arts & crafts fair. He was a great guy, and we talked for a few minutes about life, the universe, and everything. After talking, I picked up this novel and thought I’d give it a go. The first few sentences were pretty intriguing and I felt like I was going to be in for a good ride.<br /><br />By the way, my brother-in-law also had a booth at the same fair, where he was hawking his wares, I have some pretty awesome hand-crafted items that I got from him that weekend, including my absolute favorite writing pen. I mean, credit goes where it’s due.<br /><br />Back to the book, given that I have been acquainted with, and like, the author, I am actively hoping for him to do well. This, his first novel, is about a group of refugees from a calamity that destroyed their home world. As far as they know, the three aliens that crash land on earth of the very early 20th century are the very last of their people anywhere. They try to make a place for themselves here on earth and, more or less, live quietly until they die.<br /><br />Except, they keep not being able to do that. Stuff keeps happening that ruins their tranquility.<br /><br />As it stands, while this is a story that has some flaws, I’m not going to get into them, because there was something about this novel that I found intriguing enough that I didn’t really care about all that. In fact, I just finished a book (as of this writing) a day or two ago from a big publisher that I did not like anywhere near as much as I did this one.<br /><br />Weird.<br /><br />Also, the author not only has written this book, but has also created an alien language, in a Tolkienesq fashion, that these aliens use. There is a short how-to guide in the book for readers that might be interested in actually learning the language.<br /><br />And wait, there’s more! Said author also has created a board game based on the novel (that the characters in the novel play at least once, maybe twice – now that’s meta).<br /><br />So, that’s some pretty impressive world building. I tip my hat.<br /><br />In the end, I have no idea how to rate this book. After, literally, months of thinking about it, I decided that at the end of the day I enjoyed reading it. And really, that’s where it ends for me. I wasn’t bored. I loved the world building, and I’m interested enough in the characters that I will read the sequel (which I think just came out) in order to see what happens next.s in the novel play at least once, maybe twice – now that’s meta).<br /><br />So, that’s some pretty impressive world building.

785,5,"This is the first book I received through the Vine program that was actually on my wish list! I heard author Randy Singer on the radio, some months ago, speaking to the host about this book. The host told him is was one of her top ten favorite fiction books (the book IS historical fiction based on actual events) and listening to the conversation got me very interested in the novel. I was planning on receiving it from a family member for a birthday or holiday but jumped at the opportunity to get a review copy of the book. Having just finished the book, I have to say that it was completely satisfying and definitely one that I would recommend!<br /><br />This book is set in the the middle of the Roman empire - both in terms of time frame and environment. The central character of the book is Theophilus - a Roman citizen and aspiring lawyer and advocate - hence the name of the book. The story follows him through his teenage years and into adulthood as he studies law and  hones his mind and body under the tutelage of the top Greek and Roman teachers of the day. The book then transitions to his first position as an assistant to Pontius Pilate in Judea - right at the time of the trial and crucifixion of Jesus Christ and the great impact it has on him. The story of his life continues as he eventually ends up back in Rome where he eventually has a second opportunity to come to the defense of the greatest missionary of all time - the apostle Paul.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book and all of the attention to detail that Singer put into it. He, no doubt, meticulously researched many aspects of Roman life in order to write his word pictures of their daily lives and environs. He does a great job of transporting you to that ancient world and into the sandals of a idealistic young man. The story proceeds at an even and not-too-slow pace from start to finish and I can say that no part of the book was dull. It was an enjoyable read from start to finish and the best work of Christian fiction that I have ever read. I would HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone!ian fiction that I have ever read. I would HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone!"
786,5,"Nice!! Bright, sharp colors. Fun read!!"
787,3,IT'S OKAY
788,5,"Wisdom of Faith is a wonderful Christian faith based testimony of Bobby Bowden's devotion to God and a glimpse into the life of the Bowden's , through life's challenges, losses, tragedies, sorrows, motivations, accomplishments, laughter,  joy, love and faith.  Written by a very humble man who has left every Christian a true legacy.  Well worth reading for young and old. I personally thank Coach Bowden, Steve Bowden and the Bowden family for sharing their lives, wisdom and faith."
789,4,This has been helpful to me and my family.  I like that I have the digital audio that we practice along with.
790,3,"The book is OK, relatively-easy to read, but does not really explore the depth and width of this complicated and fascinating subject. It is written more like an article for a popular magazine or newspaper and less like an in-depth study. It did not really enhance my basic knowledge of the subject, and thus did not meet my expectations.<br />I would recommend it for people with no prior knowledge of economics whatsoever as a good introduction, but not for the people who have a general idea of the GDP and other common macro-economic terms."
791,5,"&#34;Cold Case to Case Closed&#34; is an extremely informative book all while being intriguing and interesting to the reader. It is evident Rich Little is dedicated to telling Lizzie Borden's story. He makes sure to pay attention to every detail and doesn't twist the facts to support his point of view.<br /><br />Overall, this book is very well written and I would definitely recommend it to others."

793,5,"Great book by a Mid South alumni member who fans like me back in the day loved to hate.  The stories in the book gives new meaning to the phrase, &#34;only in pro wrestling&#34;.  This is a must have for any OLD SCHOOL fan of pro wrestling to put in their collection.  The incident with JYD-junk yard dog alone is worth the price of this book.  Hint-there wasn't any checking of bags in the 80's for wrestling shows.  this book will go between Ted Dibiasie, Jim Duggan, and the late great Gary Hart's bios as one of my favorites.  I do hope more Mid South former Wrestlers get their stories on paper.  Other names I hope to see are Paul Orndorff, the Wild Samoans, and Kamala.  There's a name who can write great stories about old school wrestling and they call him the GRAPPLER!!"
794,5,Jo keeps me turning the pages. I love his work.
795,5,"Good book, Shortz puzzles are always good.  Good idea with the band on the book to hold your place."
796,4,"I love antiques, and primitives especially. Since I recently moved to an area with many farms nearby, I sometimes come across old farm tools or rustic household items at estate or farm sales.So, when I came across this book, I was glad to see it.<br /><br />First, the negatives - images (except the front cover) are black & white. But since about 90% of the items in the book are wood, metal or very plain ceramic - not colorful items - it's OK with me, if not ideal. While color photos and closer views of some items would have been good, the b&w photos get the job done and give a pretty good representation of what the item looks like.<br /><br />The second drawback is that the prices are no longer current. But this book was published pre-internet, and there are so many more sources for pricing information these days. Even back when it was published in 1979 it wasn't meant to set prices - just to provide a ballpark idea.But here's what makes this book useful to me.<br /><br />After the introductory material, the book's divided into 4 sections:- On the Land- Around the Barn- From Cabin Life - To Growing Towns. After these sections, are notes on buying and the (albeit outdated) pricing info.There are 1-3 images on each page. Some of the larger photos include more than one item. Accompanying each image is the name of the article, and a description of how it was used and what it was made of.<br /><br />This book has helped me identify many puzzling things. Not having grown up on a farm - and especially having not have lived on a farm 100-200 years ago! - some items I've seen at  farm/estate sales and local antiques stores were mysteries to me until I found this book.<br /><br />And there are many things in this book that I'd probably never have known about otherwise - for instance, salt bin, grain flail, mud shoes, snowhammer, a shake hammer, and froes, among many others. Without this book I never would have guessed what they were.The range of items depicted and described is fairly good - from primitive furniture (I wish there was more of that) to metal horse items to farming tools. It's not comprehensive by any means! but still is chock full of valuable information and photos. I've returned to it many times to try to identify an item I've seen, or to re-familiarize myself with all the information there.<br /><br />While there are other, more comprehensive books about primitives that I also turn to, I'm glad this book is part of my antiques books library. I wish I could give it 3 1/2 stars. But since Amazon doesn't allow half stars, 4 will do.here was more of that) to metal horse items to farming tools. It's not comprehensive by any means! but still is chock full of valuable information and photos. I've returned to it many times to try to identify an item I've seen, or to re-familiarize myself with all the information there.  While there are other, more comprehensive books about primitives that I also turn to, I'm glad this book is part of my antiques books library. I wish I could give it 3 1/2 stars.

797,5,"This book is an absolute page turner!! I was beyond impressed with the writing style and character roles. The action, suspense, drama,  & complete story line was amazing.  The writing was so clear that I could literally see characters and scenes in my head.  I will be reading this book again.....and I look forward to more reads from this amazing author! DYB"
798,5,Granddaughter loves it
799,4,"The kids love to flip through this. They are not advanced enough to try to create their own creatures, but they like to flip and find the matches."
800,5,"i LOVE IT, VERY GOOD"
801,5,When I preordered this book It didn't have the &#34;look inside&#34; feature so I didn't really know what to expect. It far exceeded my expectations. There are sooooo many adorable ideas and patterns for A LOT more holiday's than Christmas. There are nice tutorials to brush up on your stitching and great projects. Worth every penny!!
802,5,"We are all waiting for something, whether it’s on a test result, an answer, a relationship - whatever the case may be, sometimes waiting is hard. It would be so easy for us to put whatever we are waiting for ahead of who we are in the present. This advent devotional serves so well in reminding us that who we are while waiting is just as important as what we are waiting for. God works in our wait, He is right there with us.<br /><br />With the approaching holiday season, it can be so easy to get caught up in planning, shopping, dreading- that we forget the big picture- Jesus. “Waiting Here For You” guides us through short scriptures, reflections, meditations, and prayers, to celebrate what God has done for us and what He has promised to do, because He is faithful and He is right there with us in the waiting. I highly recommend getting a copy- it’s a game changer!"
803,5,"This training manual by Richard Diaz is a MUST read!!! I believe everyone will benefit from this book whether you are an elite athlete, or a weekend road warrior.  You ask me why?  When there are numerous so called trainers, and coaches, out there?  What sets Richard apart from all the others is his education, quality, and experience. I found that Richard can explain even the most detailed complex information in a way that is easy to understand.  From his manual, I have gained so much knowledge about the importance of heart rate training (an absolute must!), using correct biomechanics of movement to prevent injuries, and supplementing strength exercises to perform optimally. Richard's method of training as explained in this manual has been tested, and proven.  I am very proud to say that I have had my best race recently by following Richard's method.  My long story short is I have ran four marathons in the past four years. My results were worsening with each marathon. I was ready to give up running altogether. I decided to stop the insanity, and trained with Richard. My race result after Richard's training? I PR by 58 minutes...on the Big Sur Marathon 2014 course! Get this book. It is the best investment you will ever make. Train smarter...not harder. Thank you Richard!!!"
804,5,"Fascinating story, too bad I can't absorb all the great ideas in it!  Will re-read it next year and see if I can learn more."
805,3,"Sci Fi with literary pretensions it mostly worked for me because it was such a short read at 200 pages.  But I ended up feeling no need to read the other two books in the series -- probably because there are (I think -- based on reviews) no characters to follow forward. So, if you like the idea of engaging in the mystery of a place, then this book is for you.  But if you need characters that engage you book to book, then probably not."
806,4,"Because I often forget that I am internalizing the surrounding world too seriously, my pathetic meaningless existence becoming too stressful, I jump into the densely vivid writings of Jim Lopez. While I usually read scholarly journals, it is important to delve into Lopez's perspective, of one's world albeit a shockingly confessional journey."
807,5,"Michael knows how to weave a story.  You feel like you are in California, New Jersey, Ireland and then Key West!  I think this is one if not his best Mick Murphy mystery.  If you love a good tale, great book, so is the series!  Enjoy!"
808,5,Great
809,5,items were as expected and delivered on time...
810,5,Best book read on the subject. The immense research put into this book makes understanding the importance of the Blood Moons clear and authentic.
811,1,Didn't like recipes at all.  Sorry I bought.
812,5,Great history telling that no text explains what happen at Okinawa.
813,4,Unfortunately this CD set started skipping on my second playing on my stereo. Obviously I cannot play it in the car while I am driving so will have to find a home for it somewhere else. Otherwise I liked it.
814,5,"Aloe could be the magic bullet in the fight against many diseases & chronic medical conditions.  This book delves into the history of its use.  If you're a fan of alternative medicine & &#34;doctoring&#34; yourself with herbs, supplements, etc. this book is a great place reference on the journey to wellness."
815,5,"Scary, but good as her novels always are.  I'm not a fan of deep sea diving, but I liked this.  As usual, she fills us in whether we want it or not."
816,5,"Love it!  I'm learning so much, Thank you."
817,4,A nice 'coming of age story' for teen girls.  Probably not a good choice for boys.  The story focuses entirely on a young teen girl struggling with her Mother and surviving that awkward stage of &#34;not yet an adult&#34; but &#34;no longer a child&#34;.  The survival story becomes the catalyst propelling her into adulthood.
818,5,I really appreciate how fast the book got to my address. Everything in the discription was correct
819,5,EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS
820,5,A masterpiece of a book built on a brilliant premise.
821,3,"Book is in great condition, but it does NOT have the Supersite Code, that I paid for. Disappointing, but too late in the semester to exchange."
822,5,"Most Excellent words of Wisdom from the Beloved Miss Oprah full of inspiration, fun interesting facts about her life , how she met and became friends with people. Loved every written word and is now my new bedside table reading !"
823,4,"The only thing, I wish it was a red letter edition. Other than that it's very good."
824,5,Wonderful!
825,3,It was ok!
826,2,Choice of stars says it all
827,2,"I was disappointed in this book.  It was recommended by a reviewer and it didn't offer any insights that aren't commonly known.  Melatonin (which doesn't work long-term for everyone), good bedtime habits (if you have insomnia, you already know what these are) and matching your sleep schedule closer to your destination time as a jet-lag deterrent.  Reads like a textbook in some parts.  This seems more suited to be read by a peer of the author, not the general public."
828,5,"A historically accurate novel, written with younger people in mind.  The Gear/Gear author team does an amazing job of researching ancient cultures before incorporating that information into interesting books to read.  I enjoyed the read, as have youngsters I have shared the book with.  One teacher friend uses this book as a text in her American history class.  I  anxiously await the release of each & every new Gear novel."
829,5,Wonderfully written!
830,4,"I’m not a fan of labels, but the best description of this review is of a “Christian” reviewing a “Buddhist” book. This is a timely book that coincided with my reading of TANTRIC COCONUTS. That book was a work of fiction with a life-teaching lesson that illuminated my eyes to this: a person can deepen their Christian practice by also following the teachings of the Buddha. To some, this is sacrilege. To the open and willing, there is amazement and transformation.<br /><br />While many Buddhist Christian books focus on the Gospel of Thomas, and the producers of this book have much of that on their website, this book stays away from that focus. This book is primarily a teaching of the Buddha with many ancillary Biblical scriptures used for effect.  Note: if you are reading this to deeper your Christian walk, make sure you are already familiar with the Biblical scripture used; know what you already believe.<br /><br />As for this book itself, it took me a long time to work through it. This is a working commentary that often causes moments to pause, ponder, and reflect, inspiring long moments of meditation. I appreciated the introduction to many of the written words and sayings, much of it being overlooked by previous Westernized books of the Buddha. I’m especially thankful for the ongoing commentary to help my understanding of the older language and original translations.<br /><br />There were quite a few surprises for me here: mainly about the sayings of disciplines, punishment, and punitive repercussions due to one’s own actions. I found that much of what is discussed in the early sections of this book would prevent much of that threating and rewards of the latter. Specifically, meditation with a disciplined focus will steer correctly.<br /><br />Thanks to the folks at Light of the Spirit for sending this to me for review."
831,5,I got it for my 13 year old brother for Christmas and he loved it!
832,4,"This book is almost like a summary of all the Allon books. He brings in all the characters we have come to know. The format is<br />pleasantly familiar. Gabriel is plucked from solitude, an woman on the inside takes a big risk, the scheme is put together, things go wrong, and we pick up the pieces. I love it! I do question in this story if the price paid for rescue would have been paid. But I can't wait for the next one."
833,5,They really should have ironed the dress b4 putting it on the cover.
834,5,This book is great....love his recipes and the ease of making them!!!
835,5,"Powerful,beautiful and moving.  A must read for anyone who loves poetry."
836,3,"The Possibilities<br />By<br />Kaui Hart Hemmings<br /><br />My &#34; in a nutshell&#34; summary...<br /><br />A mother's only son was killed...this is her recovery story.<br /><br />My thoughts after reading this book...<br /><br />Cully was killed suddenly by an avalanche...he was the only child of Sarah...who had Cully when she was sixteen.  Sarah is normally a person who has humor in her life...her father lives in her basement and cannot stop buying &#34;stuff&#34; from QVC.  Cully was a sweet son but by cleaning out his room she is discovering secrets that he kept from her.  One secret is a girl named Kit...who comes to Sarah and has the capacity to change everyone's lives...sigh.<br /><br />What I enjoyed about this book...<br /><br />I liked reading about the entire family that Cully was a part of.  Sarah was interesting...her father Lyle was quirky...even Cully's father, Billy, was unique.<br /><br />What I did not love about this book...<br /><br />Perhaps this book was a tad predictable...but it could be me because I read so much...but the moment Kit appeared at Sarah's door...I sort of knew what she was there for...<br /><br />Final thoughts...<br /><br />This book was interesting but not one that I loved."
837,5,fascinating book. digestible philosophy and makes you want to adopt a wolf
838,5,A rediscovery of light and shadow and inspiring tools to use right now....Andrea A
839,4,Read it daily
840,3,"not quite as crazy as the reviews suggested it would be, feel as though their<br />could have been alot more story development also wasnt that thrilling for me.<br />but for how cheap it was i suppose it was worth a read. hell what do i know im only twenty five"
841,5,disturbing history for many i am sure but a must read
842,5,I recently purchased this book and I am already on the 4th chapter.  It is very informative and written with much wisdom.  I recommend this book to all you married women who want some kind of change in your marriage.  CAUTION: the change starts from within FIRST!  But it amazing what the LORD will do when you surrender and allow HIM to do the work.
843,5,Great Vintage magazine!
844,5,LOVED IT
845,5,"It doesn't get ANY better than Gary Jennings and Spangle remains my favorite all-time book, as it has been for 15 years."
846,5,Fast shipping - as described. Thanks!
847,5,A classic travel book with great photos and descriptions.  Love it
848,5,Very intrigueng unisex smell. Love it.
849,5,You can never have enough Lord of the Rings music.
850,5,"If you liked THE FIRM, you are going to love FORTY ACRES.  This high octane thriller really kicks the tension up a notch.  The characters are deeply flawed and perfect for a complex book club discussion.  With race relations making front page news every day, this highly charged novel is very topical and begging to be made into a film.  Set aside a couple of hours because you won't put this book down until you turn that final page.<br /><br />As a side note, the author's loving dedication to the memory of his mother is worth reading on its own.  A truly loving and wonderful memorial."
851,5,I love this book! I've read it quite a few times...and it definitely helped me build the skills I needed in certain subjects. I would recommend this book to anyone.
852,5,"OUT OF DATE IN LESS THAN A YEAR,,,,,"
853,5,Great teaching!
854,5,Thanks
855,5,thank you
856,5,Simply put...MUST HAVE!
857,4,"The guide is complete but the range maps are difficult to follow (too small) and a section with bird silhouettes in the front would be useful.  Also it is exactly the same as the Princeton Guide to European birds, which does not need to be imported from the UK."
858,3,Interesting read...
859,5,This purchase was made for a Christmas present for my Fiance. He has a great interest in zombies and a big fan of Max Brooks. I was more than happy to fulfill his wish list with this purchase! Will do business with seller again.
860,5,"Every trip to San Francisco has seen me hiking up to the intersection of Geary and Jones from the Powell St. BART station for the exquisite food at Millennium. The closest I've come to the experience has been a visit to HanGawi in NYC, so I see Millennium as a real jewel. This cookbook has allowed me to bring some of that deliciousness home with me into my own kitchen. Just as you would expect complex flavors and unique ingredients from a 5-star restaurant, the recipes in this book will push your culinary skills to new levels. This is partly because unless you live in a large city with access to lots of ethnic grocery stores or you have your own garden and greenhouse, some of the ingredients just aren't available. You'll have to adapt, modify and create in the sense of an artiste. Then, even if you're in one of those cities sporting unique and obscure food items, the recipes in this book will challenge you with their multiple steps and multiple simultaneous activities. If you're up for the challenge and you want to feel inspired by the food you cook, this cookbook will give you what you want."
861,5,"The book details the story behind one of the most well know cases to lawyers who defend those accused of crime - People v. Molineux, the New York case that set the standard for understand when other bad acts are admissible.  A required red for those who are interested in this case.  Well researched with some surprising connect to the politics of the 1970's.  You will have to read it to find out this connection."
862,5,I have the Romertopf clay pot and have had it for many years.  I had no instructions or recipes on how to use it so was delighted to get this &#34;Clay Pot: recipe book.  It arrived on time and is what I expected.
863,5,"If you're a historical romance fan, this one has it all. The author's well-sculpted cast of characters, not only come alive, but you actually begin to care about them and want them to succeed in their journey west. Her evil characters are truly scary and her good characters are painted gloriously. There's never any dull moments in this book; it's a fun and visual read that went by too quickly. The colonial setting is fascinating and gives you an up-close, personal glimpse into the life and death struggles of our pioneering ancestors who relied on each other to survive and who took time to love on their journey west.  Can't wait for her next book to come out!"
864,5,They both were very good.
865,5,This is a charming and informative overview of Halloween origins and customs. An enchanting addition to any collection!
866,5,"Another beautiful journal, which is exactly what I expect from Peter Pauper Press."
867,4,"Good read.  It's a bit aggrandizing, but then again he is a race car driver."
868,4,"Small and light, which is great.  But the page numbers are different than the larger book, which can make services confusing."
869,5,"I've been dieting since October of 2013 after receiving  medical warnings from my doctor to change my lifestyle or be subject to additional medication's for cholesterol and diabeies.Since then I've been following the medical advice of my dietician to control my food portions and  participate in some form of cardio exercise whether walking(10.000 steps a day) or water aerobics or hitting the gym.  Until that time I was losing weight up until 2 months ago, when I hit a weight plateau. I was still performing cardio activities but unable to get a handle on portion control. In other words I stopped losing any more weight. As fate would have it I discovered JJ Smith's best selling book online  and with my doctor and dietician's  endorsement, began the 10 day Green Smoothie cleanse. After 10 very challenging days I'm very proud to proclaim that I've lost a grand total of 16 lbs!!!!!I was very shocked to hear that figure myself!!<br /><br />I will mention  the minor changes I made to JJ Smith's diet. I included olives and sardines and raisins . I mixed  chia seeds with my flaxseeds. I also started drinking the G2 Low calorie Gatorade.<br /><br />While it was a great challenge to lose the weight, it will be just as great to keep it off. JJ Smith does not recommend  the full cleanse longer than two weeks. She recommends eating two low calorie meals per day with one smoothie. Her book offers many additional smoothie recipes for maintenance. My journey is just beginning."
870,5,The book is great for my 8 and 10 year old grandchildren.
871,1,Did not like the cook book
872,5,"Awesome book, for everyone who understand programming and need more info before jump into Lua."
873,5,Excllent
874,5,"For the first time I understand what Mindset really is and what it means to me.  When my upline talked of mindset, I groaned.  David Williams explains that mindset is more than just a mental attitude, it's a method of operation.  I am forever grateful for this insight.  I know it will change me for the better.  All else will follow."
875,5,"Everyone will love this book! Alan takes critical, real-life clinical lab stories and tells them in a fascinating and captivating manner. You truly will not want to put the book down. As clinical lab testing affects all of our lives, you'll find yourself wanting more stories about how lab testng may affect your own medical diagnoses and treament. This book should be used in hospital administration educational programs as well as medical schools."
876,5,Jim Butcher is basically the best writer out there. I've read and re-read each book dozens of times.
877,5,I remember this from the time it was published and have looked for it many times.
878,2,"Under a slick verbiage it's basically the same over educated feminist harangue: abortion, outrage over society's ills and astonishment at heartbreak. She's the smartest girl in the class but she's still  writing the same stuff in the diary with the little lock on it."
879,5,Love star wars bounty hunters? Buy this
880,4,Thanks
881,1,"I've had to put one star, which isn't really fair, but as it hasn't arrived yet, what else can I do?"
882,4,Love her series & wanted to get copies to fill in missing pieces.
883,5,Love the quirky characters and laugh out loud at the super far fetched plots. I am a fan.
884,5,Very satisfied
885,5,"You will want to keep it near - with the pages earmarked and highlighted, and the margins filled with notes of your personal discoveries."
886,5,Great
887,5,Love the whole peekaboo series!
888,5,"An insightful book, written with a thorough understanding of human nature."
889,5,"Wow. This is a cool book, it's big and colorful and complete, and it does what it advertises. It has cutaway sections, photos of the ship, text, and if you want a fascinating coffee table book this is it!"
890,5,using designs for crafting excellent for the price
891,4,"A British showjumper of the day describes methods for training horses to jump, with photos.<br /><br />I read this from the library years ago, and I remember thinking that the operation he ran came across as highly commercial. Horses were clearly being trained up for sale or competition and were not coming across as individuals with character.<br /><br />If I recall correctly, it was this book where the author complains that his girl grooms all fall in love with a horse with a handsome head, especially if it is a rogue. He just considers the rogues to be time wasters for him.<br /><br />This book can be more helpful to jumpers than general riding books because it is more focused. I highly recommend Anthony Paalman's book on training young horses. 'Training Show Jumpers.'"
892,5,Everyone should read this book - It will set a lot of things straight and you will see yourself as The Father sees you.
893,4,LIKED BOOK
894,5,"Though it's been quite a while since I was a &#34;young adult&#34; I found this book engaging and enjoyable. As a guide dog handler myself I am always on the lookout for misleading info. with regards to guide dogs and found very little if any in this book. Of course it's important to remember that it's a work of fiction, and a fantasy as well. Still, I really enjoyed reading it, found the characters (especially Curly Connor) engaging and realistic. I think anyone with some time to kick back and read a good book should read this one."
895,5,great
896,5,"was brand new, great price"
897,5,"Great low carb desserts that actually taste good! Easy to follow, something for everybody. I watch my carbs all the time and this book gave me new ideas."
898,5,"Perfect, as described, fast shipping, excellent seller, thank you!"
899,4,Thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Loved the complexities--a very smart read. Can't wait to see what Ms Lawhon has in store for us next!
900,5,"If anyone is interested in how consciousness truly works, &#34;Power vs Force&#34;  will bring you closer to understanding the universe within, as well as the energy fields that surround us.  I will not confuse 'power' with 'force' again !  Hawkins takes us on a clear, thoughtful journey through the different levels of consciousness, how they manifest in our world and how we may use this knowledge.  This book is truly a generous gift from a higher consciousness."
901,5,love Ree's  cook books.
902,5,I think I have done all of hers. Wish there were more.
903,3,"While this book is a good reference guide, it's nothing it couldn't have found on the internet somewhere. Still, it's nice to have a book to dog-ear and bookmark for later use."
904,5,STILL USE THIS!
905,5,Exactly what I needed.  Quick delivery!  Very pleased.
906,5,Very good condition and just what expected.
907,5,"I have nothing but great things to say about this book.  Socially Accepted taught me how to feel comfortable in whatever social setting I find myself in.  Reading the book, I picked up great tips on how to relate to other people and not feel like an alien.  I highly recommend it to everyone!"
908,5,beautifully done.
909,5,It is fun to see the penmanship of our third president and read his thoughts on the morality of Jesus in this publication.
910,5,Great book.  My grandson loves it.
911,4,I had one before but it grew legs and walked in to someones pocket
912,5,Great informative book.  Great testimony and help in becoming vegan and a lot of recipes.
913,4,"The synopsis is what made me curious about Sally Beauman's &#34;The Visitors&#34;. The historical novel is about a young girl named Lucy is in Egypt to recuperate from a bout of typhoid that also claimed her mother.<br /><br />At age 11, Lucy is accompanied with her energetic chaperone Myrtle Mackenzie who is from New Jersey and who the English born Lucy calls &#34;Miss Mack.&#34; This extended stay in Egypt brings them in the sphere of the archaeologists (for lack of a better term) who will open up King Tutankhamun's tomb as Lucy befriends Frances Winlock, the daughter of Herbert Winlock, the New York's MOMA field director at Luxor.<br /><br />In present day, Lucy is elderly and being pursued as a source for a new television program regarding the opening and to be honest, the elderly Lucy is probably the most interesting character of all. Not because she's a sweet old lady full of whimsical anecdotes, but because she's a wary, vinegary, straight forward type who has lived long enough to recognize the patterns of men.<br /><br />But most of the story is about Lucy, Frances, Howard Carter and the drama and politics surrounding the excavation, namely, did Carter and Lord Carnavon (his sponsor) break into the inner chamber of the tomb illegally, that is, before the Egyptian authorities could be present and the aftermath and selling of the discovery.<br /><br />I don't think the fascination with archaeology ever goes away once it is acquired and archaeologists of the late 1800 to early 1900s were not much better than graverobbers and in the case of the stolen objects from Greece, not better than thieves. So it makes for a fascinating subject.<br /><br />Beauman's research was meticulous and her prose style makes for a surprisingly fast read. There are parts that drag and there are limitations in the first person viewpoint that she chooses with Lucy but that didn't bother me overly much as it might another reader. I do admit that the lack of Egyptians was a little brow raising but given the time period that most of the story place in, it isn't surprising, I suppose.<br /><br />Those quibbles aside, I enjoyed the story for the most part.aising but given the time period that most of the story place in, it isn't surprising, I suppose.<br /><br />Those quibbles aside, I enjoyed the story for the most part."
914,5,"Absolutely love this book! It was a great price, great quality and contained valuable information. Size is good for quick reference and pages have tabs to help locate the area of the body you are examining. There are keys in the beginning to teach the reader abbreviations and basic layout of an ultrasound machine. I used this book alot! This book arrived quickly with no problems."
915,4,"This was the 6th Camino book that we have read in getting ready to do the Camino this fall. Each book has provided another insight into the journey. Mr. O'Brien's story was a good one in that he struggled with the walk and his weight, but he was so proud to accomplish this journey."
916,5,VERY GOOD
917,4,"I liked the answers that Veronica gave the first time through the book. I will be reading it again, and probably more than once, since it does seem to have some very good practical advise for folks no matter what their spiritual leanings are. I would recommend this book for all spiritual folks and most of the non-spiritual alike since it does have some great advice about life."
918,5,"The best children's Bible, hands down.  I have bought and received many other children's picture Bibles, but this one is the most complete and most like reading the real Bible.  I remember this Bible from when I was a child in the 70's, but it's not just nostalgia that has me choosing this one most often.  The pictures aren't as colorful as some modern ones, but I can't stand cartoonish-looking Bible characters.  These pictures have detail and accuracy that others do not.  It may be too difficult for a seven or eight year old to read on their own, but no one should complain about spending time teaching God's Word to their children.  I learned details that I didn't know myself.  I've read complaints that children's Bibles shouldn't have so much &#34;bad stuff&#34; like killing.  Maybe very young children should skip some of those details, but even a 5 or 6 year-old can and should understand that people make bad choices sometimes and that God is just, though always merciful to those who repent."
919,5,"New. Loved this book. Searched long and hard til i found it here, very cheap."
920,5,Good condition.....This book has terrific ideas.
921,5,Love books by this author and this one didn't disappoint....now can't wait for the third book in this series to come out.
922,5,Love it.
923,1,"I realize people like to restate statistics and stereotype of information, and this book is pretty much that.  While more that 50% of men will fit this authors descriptions and scenarios, it is not all.  The focus is on the same old judgements that men are more sexual and such.  However, what about the guys who do not fit all these stereotypes.  My biggest disappointment is that I see little discussed about the societal way men are treated and nurtured differently.<br />I picked this book up at a second-hand store, and I am glad because I would have been pretty angry if I paid full price for this book.<br />I will add, that I did not read the whole book cover to cover so maybe I have missed something but my analysis is that this is a basic men are like this and women are like that books.."
924,5,"Beautiful book. It's one we found in a stack of used books, but both of our girls gravitated to it. We went through the period where we (the parents) hated it because the words would run through our minds all.the.time, and then came through on the other side to love its plodding, methodical verse. It has the same kind of hypnotic, slow cadence perfect for bedtime and has been a favorite of both of our children. The words have that rhythmic lulling effect and the parallel images (turn on the moon/turn off the light... turn off the clock/turn off the moon/turn on the sun/turn on the light) have the same kind of lovely asymmetry that you find in Goodnight Moon. I will probably gift this books to others, because it seems to be of equal merit but with much less recognition than other childhood classics."
925,5,Never did rate: great.
926,4,this book has a lot of good info on the m1917 enfield and how to assemble and dis-assemble the rifle. anybody interested in the m1917 should have this book.
927,5,Great thriller.
928,5,"Since I grew up (some say I've never grown up!) so I'll change that to &#34;raised&#34; in the Red Bank area, it was very interesting to see how things used to be. Some of the pictures were very familiar to me, and I did know some of the people that were in the book. Now I know how some of the streets got their names in town, it was from the early residents."
929,5,great quality i loved it
930,5,Useful and informative book.
931,5,"It's a bit jumpy, but it's a great read!!"
932,3,"What's there is wonderful, but I believe there are more paintings that are not included.  That was disappointing.  I was looking for Rosa Bonheur's &#34;Horse Fair&#34; among others."
933,5,I bought this book to have ready for my daughter's high school graduation signed by all those that love her...This is a classic with a great message!!! Product was shipped quickly and I have no problems to report.
934,4,"As posted on my blog, Victoria's Reading Alcove<br /><br />It is, of course, rather nice to breathe the fine air of history once again. Through a chain of friends I was asked to take a look at the first two volumes of what is growing into a series called, Aunt Phil's Trunk. Even the making of these books has a historical tang to it. Aunt Phil, Phyllis Downing Carlson, was a historian and a meticulous collector of Alaskan Lore. She bequeathed this body of knowledge to her niece, Laurel Downing Bill. Laurel, fascinated with the treasure trove she had found, took herself off to university to learn journalism and history. Upon graduation she began further researching the history of her home state, Alaska. Then she began the process of weaving her own tales with those of her aunt's to create a really fascinating read. You never get lost because she always makes sure that while you are reading Alaskan history, you also know what was happening in the burgeoning country to the south.<br /><br />I found myself quite delighted wandering through the pages of this collection of stories. Bill provides some background on habitation in Alaska as early as 850 BCE. In the early chapters of volume one, Bill gives a brief history of the violent geological nature of the land. She describes how volcanoes, earthquakes, tsunamis and Arctic winters shaped the land and the islands that are near its shore.<br /><br />Of great interest to me was her research of the Russian possession of the country, and the dream of Secretary of State Seward to own the northern frontier. The purchase price of Alaska was somewhere around 2 cents an acre; $7.2 million dollars. There's a photograph of the check! There are photographs of the Russian forts, the lovely Russian princess bidding a sad farewell, and of the American soldiers taking possession of the territory.<br /><br />She adds to her story further research on the purchase price. There have been some rumors that the payment included a thank you pricefor the visit of the Russian fleet during the Civil War. Bill, in story-time style tells you that history shows a different tale. The price of the territory was already in the process of being negotiated before the war (somewhere in the 4-5 million dollar range). As far as the Russian fleet was concerned, the wars brewing in Europe put Russia at a distinct disadvantage. It was necessary to get their fleet to safety and by parking it on the American shores, Russian helped to tip the balance of support to the Union. American officials studiously ignored Russia's encroachment on Polish soil. The more things change, the more they stay the same.<br /><br />When Volume 2 begins we discover that it wasn't all settled with the deed and treaty. As gold was found and things started to perk up a bit, well, the Canadians had their own ideas of where the boundary lines were drawn. Interpretation and re-interpretation of the boundaries conveyed by Russia brought the US and Canada close to the threshold of a border war. With the building of the railroad, which ran through territory that both the US and Canada claimed, things were getting serious. As progress pushed north (1898) serious negotiations began in Quebec City to settle the issue. Finally in 1903 a panel was set up to decide once and for all where the Crown lands ended and America began. President Theodore Roosevelt informed the panel that if they didn't get it settled he would send in the Marines.<br /><br />The tales and the photographs (some 650 between the two volumes) continue to lead you through the development of this beautiful wild country including the conquest of Dinali (Mt. McKinley), the volcano Katmai, the birth of the Iditarod and stories of the men and women who had no wish to tame the wilderness, but to learn to live within its majesty.<br /><br />It's a good read and I highly recommend you check it all out!"
935,5,"Dr. Penny offers professional, warm, and caring advice to those of us who grieve.  She blankets our hearts with her care learned from facing her own grief and overcoming using God's care and promises found in scripture.  I felt like I was sitting in her office with a warm cup of hot chocolate and being nurtured through a difficult time.  I recommend it highly!"
936,5,"In Charles Dickens' last book, the world of an ward of his older sister and her husband is brought to us as Pip.  Pip sees changes in his life and is analyzed by this great English author through many levels.  Although his poor upbringing influenced him, Pip has, well you know, great expectation and aspirations.  My ESL tutee will love this book as he is smart and the expectation for him, although not great, is to keep his excellence in school, and attend college.  He is bi-lingual and now wants to be a scientist.  My tutee's mother is a university graduate in her native land and expects that her children receive a college education.  They are very smart children and study my &#34;homework&#34; routinely.  The younger tutee did not know English until two years ago, and he older brother helped him with his English and math.<br /><br />I have anticipations of hard work resulting in at least a college degree and perhaps postgraduate degrees for both of these hard-working ESL students."
937,5,"&#34;Travels to Hallowed Ground&#34; is a nice combination of Civil War history-lesson and the personal recollections of Emory M. Thomas about his visits to several battlefields and sites in the mid-eighties.  I was a bit surprised to see that someone as well-versed in Civil War history as Mr. Thomas was found it almost as difficult as I did to locate points on some of the battlefields that were not part of the main &#34;driving tour.&#34;  I enjoyed reading the author's personal thoughts as much as his recaps of what happened at the places he visited, as it gave the history a &#34;personalized&#34; feel.  Too, one has to remember that this book was published in 1987,  some 27 years ago, and some of what Thomas describes of his trips probably no longer exists...even though, he was already lamenting, in some cases, the commercial buildup around some of the places he visited.  I particularly enjoyed the last chapter of the book, &#34;Peace at Bennett Place,&#34; because I knew considerably less of this site than the others described in the book.  Now, I have &#34;the Bennet Place&#34; on my places to visit next time I find myself anywhere around North Carolina."
938,5,Great reference book!
939,4,"I didn't realize this was going to be a laminated map, and it is very large! But it is a really cool item, and I've never found anything like it elsewhere (though I've been looking for a &#34;South Side Up&#34; map for a long time). It's really fun!"
940,1,"It's a wonderful idea for them to reproduce this, but, but, but.  This volume is only the preliminary prolegomenon, we don't get to any substantial history, we don't get to what we want from the great man, and they do not promise to reproduce the rest.  I thought it might be an abridgment because one volume is far too few, but no.  Furthermore, even worse, the last line of every single page in the book is illegible.  Really! I can't imagine how they didn't notice: every last line."
941,5,"VERY DETAILED BOOK!  I learned a lot, and it explains the muscle you look up, why it can hurt, and how to use either a tennis ball, or  Thera Cane ( I have the Back Buddy that is just like the Thera Cane), to release tension at the proper pressure point. I'm impressed with the lengthy details!  It's really helped me with my muscle pain issues."
942,5,Great juicer ideas and easy to follow.
943,4,Nice little ref book.  Good photos.
944,5,"I love all these books.... I moved from Louisiana to RI and now I can't find them ! go figure. I just might have to order copies, as I had ordered some for some family members, but when they saw mine, they thought I took theirs!  :-D"
945,1,There were very obtrusive scribbles throughout the books and on the illustrations. The books were also quite tattered and dirty. I did not use them.
946,5,Awesome!  Couldn't ask for a more!
947,1,"Watch her on Ted and save your money. Much better on YouTube, not so much in print. And what's up with her name? Brene? I refuse to add that to my phone's dictionary!"
948,4,"Rimbaud is Rimbaud, condition is so,so"
949,5,"This techniques works great! I've taught both of my children to read using this book. It is a bit dated though, so the kids had some questions about some of the words."
950,5,Magazine arrived in perfect condition - had article that I was looking for.
951,5,Must read!!!!
952,5,"I believe that Mr. Calandro broke new ground with &#34;Applied Value Investing&#34;. I have read many books about the application of Graham and Buffett principles to equity and bond investment but this is the first and, to date, only book that I have read about the application of those principles to mergers and acquisitions, alternative investments, and the like. It was fascinating to learn of how Calandro applies distinct yet somewhat complementary valuation methods -- net asset value, earnings power value, and growth value -- to each valuation scenario. Indeed, the worked examples in this regard are very insightful. Perhaps that is why my copy of his book is full of dogears and notes, telltale signs of a useful book. An excellent resource."
953,4,"As a kid, it was the event of the summer to go to the beach around here. I still think of the shabby and tiny amusement park there where each ride required a number of tickets bought beforehand. It was a matter of great debate which rides were worth it or not. And there seemed to be an elaborate miniature golf course on every corner. Each had a theme and it was important to know whether you wanted growling dinosaurs or giant fire breathing volcanoes or if exotic (fake) animals were your fondest wish. Each hoped to entice the families of vacationers to take a break from the sand and sun to spend an hour in the (horribly fake) jungle. And if you had kids with you, well, plan on hitting a sickly yellow ball for a while or spending the week listening to bribes and pouting. Vacation golf was so much better than that boring old local miniature golf course. It was fancy and flashy and expensive.<br /><br />The miniature course featured in My Family and Other Hazards is not that course. That's not to mean that it wasn't fun and wasn't a cherished  part of the summer vacations of thousands of people in upper Wisconsin where the lakes are cool and plentiful. A version of a vacation by the shore in a landlocked state, (Lake Michigan notwithstanding). The Tom Thumb Miniature Golf course was lovingly concocted from spare parts and one man's ingenuity and in the seventies when this man decided to retire and sell he did so to a family from Iowa who had no real idea what they were getting themselves into or doing. Their main ace in the hole were three young daughters who at first thought it a lark and then became cheap labor as they worked long summer hours keeping the place running and fought against normal deterioration. Sometimes with pride and sometimes with resentment.<br /><br />But protect it they did through lean times and limited resources. As the girls went their own ways they each took a love of the place with them.  In all, the story is told with humor and love with a healthy dose of straight talk about the hard times. But the main thread of the story is the love of each that lasted no matter what. A fun, easy read for a summer weekend and one that will probably remind you the kid in you.ealthy dose of straight talk about the hard times. But the main thread of the story is the love of each that lasted no matter what. A fun, easy read for a summer weekend and one that will probably remind you the kid in you."
954,5,"My 10-year-old daughter loves this series and eagerly awaits book 3. She enjoys fantasy like the Fablehaven series and Harry Potter (of course) and has also enjoyed shorter books like the A Series of Unfortunate Events books, and this urban fantasy with a zombie-fighting heroine really grabbed her."
955,5,Was everything I remembered and expected about Ellery Queen anthologies
956,5,"A Way made me cry and reflect and I laughed out loud a lot. I now feel like I really want to do this pilgrimage, and at the same time I feel like I've already done it in some way through this book. I could see the scenery, got to know the people, and felt the aches of the journey. The reflections on life and faith touched me very deeply and I could relate to a lot of that journey, having gone through a lot of those same challenges and questioning. The writing is beautiful and I finished the book in just a few days.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend (and I have!) this book to anyone considering or planning on walking the Camino, as well as friends who are seeking a different perspective, and even anyone who likes short stories!"
957,5,"Just finished reading Plagued. Couldn't put it down. It's one of those books that lures you with anticipation then shocks you with surprise. What's going to happen next? I don't believe that just happened! Hopefully, Ms Sharnick is working on the next one. I'm very interested to see what more happens in the life of Michael Rhodes. Excellent! Exciting!"
958,4,"I enjoyed this book on both a visual and thoughtful level - and the price is ideal. They made a great decision publishing this as an inexpensive paperback.<br /><br />This is a book best read cover-to-cover once, then returned to for a closer look at some of Mendelsund's ideas. It's not a narrative, and it's not exactly a writing prompt book, and it's not a writing instruction book...it's simply a &#34;think about this&#34; book.<br /><br />I intend to use aspects of this book as prompts for an entry-level creative nonfiction class, where a lot of the questions that Peter Mendelsund raises are asked for the first time - but students usually haven't given a lot of thought to how they will answer them. So what they write is a lot of detail for detail's sake, without much thought given to the reader's actual experience with how those details will appear. So you get fairly blunt, uninteresting paragraphs of description (but it's a beginning class, so working through that is the point).<br /><br />Because the book is priced low, I would have no problem making this a required text. It lacks dense prose, so I think students will find it accessible - if I assign pages X to Y, they can easily focus on Mendelsund's ideas (obviously, this would be a complementary text, not the only one).<br /><br />This would be a good gift to a high school student with an interest in reading/writing. Not because it's simple, but they are the right age to approach these ideas for the first time - and actually use the ideas in their educational practice. An adult reader will appreciate Mendelsund's observations about how we read, especially if you revisit a favorite book after reading this.<br /><br />Another (negative) review has this paragraph: &#34;This is more of a philosophy book than a reading book. He is trying to describe consciousness - how we understand the world around us. At a philosophical level, he explores how we take our sensory reactions to the world around us and interpret all of that input to create context and meaning.&#34;<br /><br />I agree with that description. While that review was negative, I think it was because of the reader's expectation more than a 'failure' on Mendelsund's part.<br /><br />At 400 pages, it's not a lot of text. Many pages are 'simple' graphic elements with subtle messages. I especially liked his observation on reading as our eyes &#34;performing leaps, as do our minds.&#34; I read exactly the way he described, but I had never considered it before, nor could I really explain it.<br /><br />Other ideas are fairly obvious, and others confusing, but that's to be expected. As I said, this is not an instruction book of any sort. If you don't &#34;get&#34; an idea, he doesn't spend the time to explain point-by-point.<br /><br />I would recommend flipping through the pages first, so you understand what the book is all about - but I think a creatively-minded student of reading/writing will appreciate these ideas and have fun with this creatively-designed and thoughtful presentation. It's a fun book to flip through and I had lots of &#34;I never thought about it that way&#34; moments.of that input to create context and meaning.&#34;<br /><br />I agree with that description.

959,5,The item was as described. The price was great. It arrived shortly. A great resource.
960,5,I watched the Veronica Mars movie and this book did a great job picking up where it left off. Great mystery!
961,5,"This book is fantastic. If you don't understand why a former psychotherapist's perspective on the patient-practitioner relationship would be helpful to an acupuncturist, then I am not sure what field you think you are in. Hammer addresses many difficult and important questions, in a heart-felt and wise way that I deeply appreciated as a student. I highly reccommend this book, not only for acupuncturists, but for any healer who wants to be more self-aware in their work with patients."
962,5,Very good advice dealing with the email monster.
963,5,Nostalgic! Fun!
964,5,"Some of it I was already doing. But this book convinced me I should do more. It is very easy to read. A quick read. A valuable book full of interesting or valuable information. READ IT! Before you and your children get any more toxic. (One wonders what it is that has caused so many health problems in the USA in the past 50 years, from diabetes and asthma to obesity. It is probably a combination of things. But plastic is assuredly one of them. Maybe along with sugar. Bad air. Bad water. Chemicals in everything. But one has to start somewhere. Now I'm off to buy those mason jars.)"
965,5,"I like quick spoilers; here's mine: this is a story of a man who overcame his humble beginnings by working obsessively, doing whatever it takes to reach the highest achievements, only to be left with his unbearable emptiness.<br /><br />But then again, a good book is a reflection of its readers.<br /><br />The story is written in magical realism, so I'm not sure why people think it's macabre - the story isn't to be taken literally. In this day and age of endless violence in video games, TV shows and movies, the story isn't really that shocking. It's written in a way that makes the murders perfectly understandable, making me feel that, by reading this book, I get to take a peek at the mind of a serial killer. I think this is a thought provoking story; after all, shock value can only go so far. I can empathize and understand the protagonist and find a glimpse of myself. And that makes it a good read."
966,5,"My kids loved this book when they were little so I got this for my daughters baby, she loved the vintage look!"
967,5,"Brand new book for at a discount, 5 stars! Will use it extensively so quality is a must, and that was delivered."
968,5,This part of the series ends on a great note that leads into the anticipated sequels and wonder about the prequels. It was an exciting read and met my expectations of a proper ending.
969,5,Read it or else! This series is fantastic! I read the whole series to my wife while she goes to sleep every couple of years.
970,1,"I loved this book for 244 pages.  Then came the end, which was arbitrary and malevolent.  It doesn't not flow out of the preceding material.  It just flows out the author's hatred of a happy ending.  When I finished it I did something I have never done with a book before:  I tore it to pieces and threw the pieces across the room.  I will never read anything else by Jeffrey Lent as long as I live.  The rotten bastard broke my heart.  Don't let my vitriol intrigue you into reading this crashing disappointment, unless you, too, hate happy endings."
971,5,"Our lives today are filled with iPads, iPhones, emails, and text messages.  We are quickly forgetting what real communication looks like. The fact is that every one of us has the potential to profoundly affect the people we meet every day, whether we are in a job interview or simply picking up milk at the store.  This book contains great interactive lessons that teach us tools to improve our relationships, both personal and professional.  There is a line in the author's dedication that has stuck with me, &#34;Some people wander through life experiencing fleeting moments of happiness; few people grab life, ingest it, enjoy it, and really live it!&#34;  So please, do all of us a favor, and read this book!"
972,4,"As usual for Preston we start with a lovely premise and launch into a radically different direction ! He's good at it too!<br />Here's is a great summer read, fast paced, interesting and memorable.  Not on a par with his colaborations with Lincoln Child of course  But then what is !  It calls for a sequel ."
973,3,"Michael Smerconish is a popular writer who's best two times New York Time bestselling author and one of America's most important talk hosts according to the Talkers Magazine. I saw him several times at the HBO Real Time with Bill Maher show, and I must admit he is truly an engaging host with powerful arguments and interesting perspectives on current issues.<br />Talk: A Novel is, first of all, not a novel, but an approach to current issues in the 'form' of a novel. This will probably be a controversial analysis, but the way I see it, Smerconish chose the novel fiction format to express his ideas. In my humble opinion, the idea kind of works. The scenario is Florida, and with a sarcastic and humorous voice, Smerconish takes us into the backdrop of the most important presidential election of our lifetime for the conservative party. The climax is both complex and deeply satisfying, which makes this a good read, especially for the summer."
974,5,"Another great book, lots of wonderful songs at a wonderful price.  The book arrived fast and in great shape. It's just great when you can get a great deal."
975,5,Will be utilizing pattern for granddaughter's wedding present next year.  Easy to understand the directions for the patterns and good illustrations.
976,5,"Very cute board book with Classic Pooh illustrations.  Almost every time is time for Pooh to eat, fans will love this for the little ones in their lives"
977,3,"I am a veteran sock knitter and my favorite technique is using dpn.  However, I wanted to see if this could be an innovative, faster, and fun way to knit socks.  I like the technique very much.  In fact, this would have been a five star review were it not for the errata. There are errors in the majority of patterns.  All readers should go to the author's web site, or to her individual patterns on the web to find and download the many corrections to the print patterns.  I then cut and taped the correct info into the book. I do recommend this useful book, but until the numerous pattern errors are corrected, I cannot give it a higher rating."
978,5,I bought this book to use as quilt designs. I think it will work. The pictures are the correct size.
979,5,"Esp when getting it used. Lots of info for me, a beginner. Explains things very well. Buy this book. BYE"
980,5,"As a born and bred New York City gal, Fairstein's crime thrillers always give me a wonderful look at a slice of Manhattan history, all wrapped up in wonderful crime novels. Alex Cooper, Asst. DA in the NYC Sex Crimes unit has a tough task ahead of her in Terminal City when a body is discovered, and then another and she's led into the bowels of Grand Central where she discovers the &#34;mole people&#34; who live in the abandoned tunnels, including flashers and crazies and some savvy street people. Uncovering the identities of the victims, unearthing a train car used by FDR to reach Manhattan in secret, she's also confronted with some distressing news on the romance front. Following their flirtation that escalated to the physical, Alex and NYC detective Mike Chapman are dealing with a prickly awareness and Mike's sudden return after an abrupt &#34;vacation&#34; has Alex' instincts flaring. Something's up and it does look good and when Mike lies to her, she's twisted up by more than her case. When a past threat is linked to the case, when it becomes clear that the President's upcoming visit might be an end game for the killer, the Feds get involved, along with an exemplary cast of characters including a janitor, a transit cop with an affection for the mole people, an informant, it produces an edgy and thrilling mystery that will suck you in as neatly as Alex is sucked into the dark dance with death. In addition to the marvels of crime writing, Fairstein stuffs the book chock full of wonderful in-depth history (almost bordering on the 'too much', though not for me!) of Grand Central station, the history of train travel in the US, the defunct Biltmore and it's romantic &#34;meet me under the&#34; clock and even background on the changing homeless landscape in NYC. The ending is nail-biting and among Fairstein's best plots and I even knew the answer to one of the ubiquitous Jeopardy questions that Alex, Mike and best friend Mercer Wallace bet on. The secondary cast is, asalways, superb and varied, and except for the most minute of pacing slow-downs when the historical background is unfolding, this book is red-hot, rocket sharp and intense."
981,5,"I don't want another history book, I want something I can read a little at a time.  This book provides just that.  It gives enough details to keep me interested but not so many that I don't need to make it boring.  I have greatly enjoyed it."
982,5,I find this book very informative and helpful. There are tips and tricks that make this book interesting as it is clearly written and well illustrated.
983,5,Great book with good pictures. Her instructions are alittle hard to follow as she gives only one or two illitrations. I would prefer all pictures with  step by step instructions that way u can check were u are at all times during the contruction.
984,5,"This is on of the sweetest, most fun manga I have come across. The manga-ka is also brilliant in that it is still up in the air who Kyoko ends up with. I throw all my support behind Kuon (yay! :D), but I can still see how it could get turned around and she could end up back with Shotaro. Usually you can tell from the very beginning who the heroine will end up with, but given the past and present relationships each has with her, and the fact that after 32 volumes she still hasn't found out Ren is lying to her about his identity... I love a manga-ka that can keep me guessing!"
985,5,Just spent a delightful weekend on the beach with the paperback version. It is a sexy and fun read with enough smart dialogue to make it a guilt free indulgence.
986,5,These were my favorite childhood characters ....Very glad to have found this familiar book....good read for your children ..super fast shipping...
987,3,Not what I would have expected from Jacqueline Carey (maybe Janet Evanovich but too trite for Jacqueline.). It's nice fluff
988,5,I find this book inspirational and thoroughly enjoy it.  Steve Poos-Benson is a visionary that will attract young people back to the loving arms of Christ.
989,5,I could not put this book down. Great love story and beautifully written. I cannot wait for more writings from B.L. Smith. I recommend everyone to read!!!!
990,1,"I bought this book to make the prismatic quilt.  This was my first full size quilt.  The directions were not sufficient and although I bought the yardage it suggested in the size listed for the backing, there is not nearly enough.  I do not recommend this book  **I continue to be frustrated with this book, the templates are impossible to use and the directions are much too simplistic.  The instructions for making prairie points tell you how to fold and press prarie points, but not how to attach them to the edge of the quilt."
991,5,"No that it's all fun and entertainment. But that it will truly open your eyes to how the world has changed for girls in the last 12 to 25 years. I'm happy to just be informed. Also, read Boys Adrift - equally as valuable."
992,5,"I cannot wait to read this book, its sitting on my desk waiting it's turn :)<br />Shipping was super fast, good job everybody! Feeding my reading addiction and speedy delivery, I can read faster now!!!<br />Seriously though, this is a great series, and if you've bought this book you know what I'm taking about, since it's not the first book.<br />Read on &#60;3"
993,1,"Some of the descriptions of abuse were unnecessarily graphic. I fully believe that such things do transpire, and even worse things. However, I think this was grossly overdone. The images these scenes create do not easily leave our minds, and they very disturbing images. I am disappointed Patterson would stoop to such depths for a compelling plot. I have read many of Patterson's novels, but will give serious consideration before I read another, and will not recommend his books again. Was just too much."
994,5,"Stuart Woods is a very prolific writer, and I believe I have read most of his work.  He always drags me right into the story, allows me to believe &#34;aha! This time I see exactly where we're going, and THIS TIME I already know how it's going to end&#34;.  Nope he stills turns it around on me and when it closes I'm always asking myself &#34;now why didn't I see that coming?  He got me again!&#34;<br />Once again, he got me with Carnal Curiousity.  A Stone Barrington novel (my favorit) and I read it straight through missing another nights sleep in the pursuit of reaching the conclusion smug in my knowledge that I knew what was coming, and thrilled with the unforseen conclusion.  Darn you, Mr. Woods, I'll get you next time!"
995,5,This book gave me some great practical applications on how to develop a plan and lifestyle of prayer. Men wanting to develop or improve their prayer lives will find a fresh and workable approach to prayer in Becoming a Man of Prayer.
996,4,"A very detailed review of Steel Concrete composite bridges discussing all the updates included on the new Eurocode. Abundant examples that will be very helpful to new and expereinced designers of this type of bridge structures. Altogether , a very good reference to have on your library."
997,5,I have a collection of Eric Jerome Dickey books and I absolutely love all of them. I would recommend his entire collection!  Fast shipping!  Must have!
998,5,"For a book which first appears to be just a biography of Japan's greatest monster-maker (and I don't say that to diminish its subject, not at all), the reader is also treated to a good glimpse of the filmmaking world Eiji Tsuburaya devoted his life to.  Not like the multi-mega-bucks budgets and the high stakes publicity buzz or manufactured star power of Hollywood in the USA, you get the real sense that filmmakers in Japan pursue their craft with a genuine devotion to an art form and a noble profession.  Mr. Tsuburaya was clearly no exception.  Japan has and has had its media stars, but this book leaves you with the impression that dedication to the work is as or even more important that any public acclaim or fat paychecks.  In fact, it is abundantly clear that Tsuburaya's love for his work came at the expense of his health and perhaps longevity in his later years.<br /><br />This book is not just about a guy who made rubber monster suits.  It's about a man and the team of loyal and dedicated artisans he assembled that, collectively, with their &#34;sensei's&#34; guidance, expertise, vision and instinct created some of the most impressive cinema visual effects ever.  Inventing many and perfecting most of their techniques, often with skeletal production budgets--certainly not with the avalanches of money equivalent Hollywood productions get for their SFX--you can begin to understand the sheer skill and talent these craftsmen had to fool the eye and immerse the viewer in their worlds.  Not always; on occasion there might be a scene in a Tsuburaya film which appears rough around the edges or a bit stretched in quality.  This can virtually always be attributed to the Tsuburaya production team being pushed or rushed for time, and/or simply not having the budget they were expecting or promised.  August Ragone's book conveys these insights well, not just for kaiju films but for everything production Eiji Tsuburaya was involved in: historical pieces, documentaries, dramas,etc.  This a focused history book, not just a text and photoplay layout of monster movies.<br /><br />The book is filled with what must be archival photographs of Tsuburaya filmmaking, both pre-production and actual on-set shooting.  It's surely true that most of these images have never been seen in the USA, or even anywhere else outside of Japan before August's book gave them to us.  They will let you see a view of the painstaking work that went into the detailed miniature sets these Japanese artists created from scratch.  And you will get a feeling for the absolute hell it was and still can be for a stunt actor to be inside one of those cumbersome rubber monster costumes.  For hours each day of filming.  My take-away impression after reading about it was that they did it out of a dedication to their craft and art form, not giant paydays.  All of this and more can be learned from the pages of &#34;Eiji Tsubuyara: Master of Monsters&#34; by August Ragone.  And be assured, if you love kaiju or tokusatsu movies of any kind, or just are interested in fantasy filmmaking, your first time read-through won't be your last."
999,5,My grandson was ecstatic to receive this book set for his tenth birthday. We went down south to bring him his gift and he read all weekend!;)
1000,5,This book is the perfect guide for beginners and those who have experience with etsy. It answered a lot of questions on how to and taught me so many other things that I needed to do in order to improve my etsy shop. Since making some of the needed changes the traffic on my etsy shop has almost doubled.<br />I love it!!
1001,4,Punisher starts off trying to rescue people hurting himself as he does.  Now V.I.G.I.L is after him too.  So he is trying to save the city as well as being hunted by an anti-vigilante task force and finding who is starting all the fires and bombings.  And two cops have Punisher.  One likes him and wants to let him do his thing but the other is too by the book.  It's all fighting this book.
1002,3,"Book is ok; in the past I purchased other tourist books that had great information, lots of photos and better description.  I wouldn't NOT suggest it, but I wouldn't purchase it again."
1003,5,lots of fun advice from a different perspective! i liked the style and the format and lots of little tricks and tips
1004,5,Great book! Really helped me in the classroom with behavior issues. Love everything Responsive Classroom puts out. Definitely a good read
1005,5,"This worked well as a one disc audio drama.<br /><br />The voice acting and enhancements (music, sound effects) worked well together.<br /><br />It is the story of a particular scout squad of the Ultramarines who ...<br /><br />[beware spoilers follow]<br /><br />The nickname of the squad leader is the Eye of Vengeance.<br /><br />The squad is with two Ultramarine companies on an agriworld where the forces of Chaos are kicking Imperial rump ... Because, the Chaos forces have a forge that can turn any killed/recovered scrap into a Chaos war machine.<br /><br />The squad does battle royale and defeats the forge/shrine with some loss.<br /><br />Interestingly, I am pretty sure that 1/2 way through the story the squad kills the warlord, but it is a bit glossed over.<br /><br />Let m know if I got that right, but the warlord is mentioned in the opening in his ambiotic filled blister, and the very thing is described as being destroyed by the squad.<br /><br />Curious.<br /><br />This one is worth a listen."
1006,3,"Although Kathryn put a great deal of effort into the very first few generations of our family, the later portions of the book, covering my particular branch of the family is very convoluted and contains a large number of faulty entries.  My only assumption is that the information I provided somehow got mislaid or mis interpreted.  Her single focus is on the Levy family and there is very little information if any or the spouses of those family members.  There are some very interesting portions and some nice copies of photographs."
1007,5,"Got this book before our other son was born and started reading it to my older son. It's a great way to introduce the idea of having a baby brother to your older child. Once the baby was here, my older son seemed to react well to the new baby and loves his little brother."
1008,5,Makes one even prouder to be Scottish. A very easy to read and educational experience. We'll be adding this information source to our Scottish information available to our Castle McKenzie guests on the bookshelves of our North Carolina vacation rental property.
1009,5,"I was diving in Canada and the lodge hosts had this book on their dinning room table.  After easily finding a type of gunnel, that I have been trying to ID for years, I couldn't put the book down.  Before the night was over I had logged in to my Amazon.com mobile app and purchased the book.  There was no doubt I wanted it waiting for me when I returned from the trip.<br /><br />Doubtful the authors meant for the book to be read cover-to-cover, but it's so well put together and pretty to look at that I couldn't help myself.  This is a must-have reference book for any Pacific Northwest diver, or anyone looking to learn more about the amazing little beings that inhabit our home waters."
1010,5,"This is a fascinating book and I hope the medical establishment will begin to research this &#34;paradox&#34;, if it exists. I am taking 4,000mg of Vit D3, having  D3 level measured and taking calcium fairly regularly for the first time. Currently I'm trying to get K2 from food as I take warfarin and my doctors haven't confirmed whether it's safe for me."
1011,5,"I just got this book a few days ago. And I've already blazed through it. It gives the beginning real estate investor a framework to which to build on. It has ACTUAL instructions on how to go about beginning in real estate investing. The numbers, of course, are outdated, but the principals are still the same. I recommend this for anybody looking to break into real estate investing."
1012,5,"It led to a lot of great discussions on our last road trip. If you're a Fresh Air fan, this is a must-have!"
1013,5,I searched for these high and low only to run across them on amazon. These are also great for keeping the grandkids busy for hours.
1014,5,"I suppose, really, that any country one has not grown up in can be an enigma.  I have always loved my visits to Japan, and while I would never presume to &#34;know&#34; the country, I found a deep connection to some traditions and social behaviors that reflect my own beliefs and outlook, i.e., courteousness, cleanliness, and interactions with nature.  However, this book has laid bare a part of Japan's soul, and I realize that there is much more to the people of Japan than I thought.  Pilling, through his interviews and conversations, reflects the complexity and essence of a country and its people as they struggle to survive when facing major national events.  I highly recommend this book."
1015,5,Very helpful and insightful. It helped me a lot in preparing for the faith lessons for the recent Israel trip.
1016,5,Neede this book in my studies to become familiar with St. John the Cross.  He is a Carmelite Saint and from what I have heard can be very difficult to understand.  This book hopefully will give me some insight about who he is.
1017,5,"I was honored to be able to preview the book cover before it hit the shelves. The moment I read what the books was about I couldn't wait to for it to be released - I needed to know how the book ended! The majority of the books I read have been dystopian literature and I've been wanted to expand my readings to different genres. If you are looking for a book with history, treasure-hunting-adventure & suspense look no further - You’ll even see a little romance with a twist ;) Every time I put the book down, I couldn’t stop thinking about what would happen next – it made for a quick read. I can’t wait for the next book in the series."
1018,5,"We all love the book....a perfect gift for family, friends, etc.  So many quotes for all of us to read and appreciate"
1019,5,"I have been writing computer programs for more than 45 years. This is the most understandable book on how computers work that I have discovered during that time. Honestly, I was always more interested in what I could produce with the computer than how the computer did its job. As long as a computer added two plus two got four, I was happy. How it accomplished the task was just a mystery.<br /><br />However, if you want a basic idea of how a computer works, this is a great book."
1020,5,"Whether you know it as Dreamland, Paradise Ranch, Groom Lake or Area 51 it is a facility shrouded mystery. Shedding light of many of the dark projects there, as well as many others less in the dark, author Bill Yenne also takes the reader through their history and importance. This book only just published  Area 51 Black Jets  begins in 1940 with the designation of an inhospitable 3,000,000 acres of land in southern Nevada as an Army bombing and gunnery range before describing a complicated evolution where areas where pieced out for a variety of government programs. The advent of the Cold War and nuclear weapon experiments brought increasing secrecy to the vast areas as well as the specified area for aeronautical experimentation as well as testing, Area 51.<br /><br />Yenne blends detail and historical overview pleasingly with passion and excitement. He has a lot to tell from which must have been an immense research effort. Once through with the book it is amazing to realize there were only 192 pages as it seems like so much more must have been read given the context and revelations regarding the aircraft and programs described within. Yenne also includes 140 color photos, 90 b/w images as well as 18 diagrams in this richly made book with so many of the pages possessing background images or textures. Many sources were used for the photos but particularly those from the author’s collection as well as those of Tony Landis and Terry Panopalis underscore the finer points and are not commonly seen elsewhere.<br /><br />No less than 21 aircraft are discussed (see the table below) with many more mentioned to lesser extent. Program names (sometimes shifting program names) as well as designers and pilots are there to see. Importantly, the impetus of the research as well as the resulting importance of the results are told by Yenne so one can synthesize the merits of each program into a final analysis  not only the statistics.<br /><br />Area 51 has seen aircraft developed for high speeds, high altitudes, low observable technology (“stealth”) as well as long endurance. Key chapters for most are likely to be the ones on the U-2, A-12, SR-71 and F-117 and they do not disappoint. The difficulties and successes of each program are there to read as well as their niches in history. Aside from the major aspects there are many intriguing details given by Yenne which underscores his deep knowledge of these subjects, like:<br /><br />How “Dragon Lady” came to be the nickname of the U-2/TR-1 (and not likely what the reader may expect) as well as the dynamics of the destruction of the U-2 Gary Powers piloted that fateful day<br /><br />The ugly bureaucratic nature of the SR-71′s retirement<br /><br />Why the F-117 was designed as a flat panel aircraft and the technological limitations which would be overcome for the curvilinear nature of future designs<br /><br /> There is so much more than these chapters than these aircraft and so many historical aspects are discussed:<br /><br />The novel mission, design philosophy and all-round stealth (as opposed to only the front) of the Northrop Tacit Blue (nicknamed “The Whale”)<br /><br />The program start which began the Red Eagles (who flew MiGs for air combat maneuvering assessment) and migrated to the close cousin of Area 51, the Tonopah Test Range<br /><br />The D-21 Tagboard Mach 3+ 5 ton drone launched from a modified A-12<br /><br />UFO sightings and probable causes<br /><br />The deep dark Aurora program<br /><br />No less than 21 aircraft are described in this book. Some in more detail than others though the reader will not be disappointed in the division of attention.<br /><br />This book is equally suited for the aviation enthusiast as well as the historian. Area 51 Black Jets addresses so many of the seemingly innumerable as well as fantastic aeronautical advancements accomplished there. It is an incredible story told well by Bill Yenne.<br /><br />&#60;&#62;&#60;&#62;&#60;&#62;&#60;&#62;&#60;&#62;&#60;&#62;&#60;&#62;<br /><br />As is the publishing business custom, Zenith Press and On-line Bookstore provided a copy of this book for an objective review."
1021,3,"I found this book to be very interesting in subject, and the author is obviously intelligent and well read, but often this book is confusing in terms of consistency and chronological events.  Ms. Stewart often begins a point only to go off on tangents that seem to lead nowhere, and the original destination is not circled back to or even referenced again.  She is great at depicting the horrors of her childhood, but in the end one is left wondering exactly how she fulfilled her \\""calling\\"".  She did reach her goal of becoming an Uber - educated nurse, but the specifics of how she swallowed her past and embraced her future are vague and unsatisfying.  The family genealogy on both parental sides is somewhat irrelevant and unnecessary to the overall story.  The book seems to be written in an outline style, making it difficult to engage the reader enough to care about the outcome of the story.  There is too much inclusion of psychology and nursing - related terms and definitions,  making one wonder if they are reading an autobiography or a textbook.  The author would have done better to leave out most of the nursing glossary and to have given the reader more of her soul, feelings, and underlying anger towards her parents."
1022,5,"For a 46 year old paperback, this book is in remarkable condition.  The translation remains one of the most clear and beautiful versions of the Holy Bible.  Whether you are already a devoted reader or have been thinking of reading it for the first time, I highly recommend the Jerusalem Bible."
1023,5,It's such a wonderful book about having faith in the Lord and not being scared. Well the title says it all.
1024,4,"It's probably lost to history.  But would of liked more specific details and his childhood, personal family, and his child."
1025,5,"I have been looking for a particular recipe since I left Honolulu many years ago, and found it in this wonderful book full for local recipes.  Reading through this book brought back great memories and made me write out a large 'need to make' list.<br /><br />The seller wrapped this purchase so very carefully, it arrived unscathed, which almost never happens with used bayer back books.  I will be happy to do business with this seller again."
1026,4,"As a novice birder, I've become more & more fascinated by how beautiful Owls are. The book was a little smaller than I expected but has good content."
1027,5,Students love this.  I am always afraid we will lose one of the tiles but we got through a whole year with set intact.  Lots of ways to use it and students love anything with magnets.
1028,5,"N.T. Wright has written many popular level books.  For a new reader, many of his ideas are very different, and use lines of thought that are completely foreign.  Much of it is intriguing, but very often the reader is left saying \\""that was interesting, but I don't quite see how he got there.\\"" Or, as a 3rd grade math teacher often says, \\""Show your work, Tom!\\""  In the Christian Origins series, Wright shows his work, and it is rigorous and worldview shaping.<br /><br />NTPG is the introductory book 1 of a 5 part series: 2. Jesus ([[ASIN:0800626826 Jesus and the Victory of God]]/ [[ASIN:0800626796 The Resurrection of the Son of God]]), 3. Paul ([[ASIN:0800626834 Paul and the Faithfulness of God]]), 4. The Gospels (forthcoming), and 5. Conclusion.  In NTPG Wright lays the groundwork for the rest of the series methodologically, philosophically, historically, and theologically.  He hints at how the rest will follow, but only offers the briefest of sketches of his later books.<br /><br />After an Introduction, the second section explores his epistemology - \\""critical realism\\"" and makes the case for coming at the New Testament material with the integrated lenses of Literature, History, and Theology, rather than an isolated and fragmented \\""specialist\\"" perspective.  This was the most rigorous philosophy I've read in awhile, but it gives direction to his project, and was enjoyable to read as only Wright can be.<br /><br />The meat of the book is found in part 3, \\""1st Century Judaism within the Greco-Roman World.\\""  He reconstructs the history from 587 BC to 135 AD within which the various strands of \\""Judaisms\\"" developed.  This time period came alive to me while reading this.  The revolutions, the various sects, the would-be messiahs.  I felt like I was breathing the cultural air that was swirling when Jesus came.  This was incredibly helpful.<br /><br />Wright takes it much deeper though, and this is where your entire paradigm is in danger.  He uses Israel's stories, symbols, and praxis to reconstruct a basic worldview, and then delves deeply into Israel's beliefs and in the climax of this section \\""The Hope of Israel.\\""  Understanding the worldview, beliefs and hope of a 1st century Jew has opened up the entire Bible in ways I never understood before.  Wright knows the Old Testament intimately, a well as the later developments showcased in the apocrypha, pseudepigrapha, and other literature of the period.  It takes effort to work through these sections, but the result is a big picture grasp of the whole Bible in which the various parts fit coherently, not bits and pieces tacked awkwardly together.<br /><br />It is within this historical and theological setting that Jesus comes, lives dies and rises, and the christian church is born.  When set against that backdrop the New Testament explodes with significance.  I am devouring my Bible with more enthusiasm than I have had in quite a while.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand the big picture of the Bible.  If you have read the Bible enough times to be familiar with all of its parts and have wrestled with various hermeneutical structures (covenant theology, dispensationalism, all the inbetweens) this book will do wonders for you.  The pieces that never quite fit quite right will fall into place.  Even the guys who disagree vehemently with specific details or implications (think \\""justification\\"") praise Wright for his big picture of the Bible.  This is the book that starts it all off.<br /><br />I recommend plowing straight through, even the difficult sections.  Don't bother with the footnotes - they will still be there the second time around.  It will take multiple readings to fully digest all the details and then the implications of Wright's picture, but it is envigorating and delightful.<br /><br />I also highly recommend [[ASIN:0800628276 The Climax of the Covenant]], a collection of essays which are heavy on actual exegesis of New Testament texts and setsfirm Bible roots to the big picture painted in NTPG.firm Bible roots to the big picture painted in NTPG."
1029,5,"Birth Of Agony had me up reading late into the night, watching the story unfold in my hands. The characters very quickly became engaging to me, and the pace was relentless throughout. I enjoyed this book a great deal, and I am eagelrly expecting the sequel. Highly recommended!"
1030,3,I learned that buying a book without any information is not a good idea.  I thought this book might be about the reorganization of Fr. Polynesia government  & it's really about the Latter Day Saints (Mormon) church there.  Good if that is your interest.  Not much if that's not your interest.
1031,3,"I would not recommend this book unless you are a pastel artist, mostly pastel examples.  Very rough draft.<br />Lisl Harper"
1032,5,I just love finding a book I have should have read when I was 18... it could have saved me a whole lot of trouble if I had paid attention to what was said
1033,5,"A real eye opener for the clients, prospects, CPA's and attorneys we work with. Very well written and informative.  Clearly illustrates the importance of our holistic planning process.  Thanks Dan for helping me help my clients understand the difference between &#34;all done&#34; and &#34;well done&#34;.  Great job!"
1034,5,A great tool for daily devotion and meditation.  I use it for meditation and use the prayers as tool in daily life spiritual strengthening.
1035,4,This is a decent well written book that tells us a lot more about who Sharon Tate was. Tells more about Polanski and her immediate family. Tells plenty about the underside of the 60s. She was hugely in the wrong place at the wrong time. May she and her friends rest in peace.
1036,5,"Earlier this month I ordered a copy of this book from the USA because it was not released in Europe at the time.  Being a recently diagnosed celiac I knew I had to get this book quick.  For months I had been prescribed medication for anxiety, acid reflux etc.  None of which were any help.  The Doctor who was treating me told me it was all in my head and he wanted to hear no more of my nonsense.  This book brings a lot of comfort to anyone plagued by celiac disease or gluten intolerence and let's us know it is not all in our head as the Doctors have had us believe.<br /><br />This book gives confidence to push for answers and it is admirable that the author did not give up on her search.  That's why I believe this book is worth reading not ony for CD or GI people but also people who feel unwell and ther GP's will not take them seriously.  You are a person and let no Doctor treat you any different."
1037,1,Boring dull story. N.Roberts has done better. only listened to first 2 books. No more Nora for me. Very disappointing
1038,1,"I purchased this book because it was required for a class. While the author had some good points, he was extremely long-winded and could have easily conveyed his beliefs in half the space. It is annoying to read the words &#34;in conclusion . . . &#34; and have the author go on for another 5-7 pages (no joke)."
1039,5,I bought this for an Italian basket to go along with the steamer I put in the basket !Looked great
1040,5,Great read for anyone seeking to deepen their faith.  Dr. Kreeft does a wonderful job as he presents his case for Jesus and the Catholic faith.  This book is well worth your time.  You will come away more enriched in your love of Jesus and his importance in your life.
1041,5,I Thoroughly Enjoyed reading &#34;Special Operations&#34; !  Tom Lucas created an Extremely Descriptive/Detailed Novel... which slowly draws you in and then leaves you NOT wanting to put the book down....and Wanting the Sequel !!!
1042,4,The tabulature for these songs could have been more interesting - basically a &#34;transcription&#34; of the cords from Simon to guitar tabs. No interpretation or much variation to enhance the voicings. But the title does say &#34;transcribed&#34; and that's basically what I got.
1043,5,reminds me of the stories my great grandmother told about settling in Texas. Can't wait for the sequel. couldn't put it down.
1044,5,Replacing my old one that got lossed in our last move. Got to keep the classics! He can sneak this one to boot camp.
1045,5,"At a time when so much in this world conspires to make us small, Sunne's Gift helps us expand our imagination beyond the predominate beauty standards that dominate current corporate and mainstream cultural messaging.  Part of the beauty of the book is that it was both entertaining and relevant.  My children were engaged from cover to cover as the characters, imagery, and message all resonated with them.  Delivering a meaningful message is one thing.  Delivering that message in an entertaining and stimulating way is what makes this book unique.  An absolute must read for anyone interested in socializing the benefits and necessity of diversity.  It will challenge and inspire all who read it to think &#34;outside the box&#34;."
1046,3,I picked this up for personal use and had to put a ton of stickers to cover all the nudity.  It is not needed and with kids in the house it is not appropriate
1047,3,"this was a little... gimicky... but overall, it was a good read and if I could actually follow the plans useful."
1048,4,"I enjoyed this book very much, especially since Emily is the main character.  She is my second favorite, after Charlotte.  I have to say, most of my favorite Pitt novels are the ones where Emily and Charlotte are very involved.  It was nice to have Emily as the main character in this story.  An old mystery haunts the village where she is visiting and she works to help people, especially her dying aunt, find peace."
1049,3,"Bought this book because my daughter developed a fascination with the moon Titan - she simply couldn't get enough information. She is in high school and found this book to be informative, but dry as a read and low in interesting because it lacked enough photos to help illustrate some of the information."
1050,5,See my comments for the Excel 2013 Essential Skills.  What I said that book also applies to this one.  Well done Mike Smart!
1051,5,"This is truly a remarkable book by Bobby Gilmer Moss. A splendid book for those patriotic souls who love researching their ancestors who took part in the great struggle, which was the American Revolution."
1052,5,"I have always been a big fan of the Cornell Method of note taking, where you have the space to the left or right to list the highlights to help jog your memory or go back and expand on that point.  This notebook helps you do just that."
1053,4,"This is a good book to try other meals when using the fast diet. There are recipes in the main Fast diet book, but using this book you even have a larger variety."
1054,4,"I think of this book more of a novelty for new cat owners - a cute gift that might offer some mildly interesting information, but shouldn't be the sole information source. The book is extremely cute, and the idea of treating a cat like some sort of product is great. I smiled to myself while reading it, because everything in it is so true. As I said, though, it's nothing super helpful and a dedicated (though likely much more boring) book on things like grooming, training, etc is probably necessary."
1055,4,"This is not my favorite of Wisler's books (see Caleb's Choice, a great novel by Wisler), but it is worth the read.  It tells about the brief Indian reservation experiment on the Brazos River, south of Fort Belknap, and the adventures and bonding of Elias (the son of the schoolteacher) and Thomas (Tonkawa boy)."
1056,4,"Learned a lot from this book.  If you don't finish it and think a little harder about donating your body to science, then you missed one of its larger points."
1057,5,Quality product just be careful. Never leave the book laying on its spine. I did and it gave the book a water damaged look
1058,5,"Anyone from Montana, Idaho Washington or Oregon should read this book.  Tells about huge glacial Lake Missoula and how all the water from that Lake washed across eastern Washington and formed the scablands and roared down the Columbia River scouring out the Columbia Gorge and filled the Willamette Valley with eastern Washington topsoil and lots more."
1059,5,"Finally a realistic romance novel...written with wit and poignancy.  It's a fast-paced, enjoyable read and I was sad when it was over.  I vote for the author to write a sequel!  Kudos to Amazon for recognizing such a fresh, gifted writer."
1060,5,Pocket size and factual. Highly recommend this to all practitioners. A great resource to always have on hand for optimal prescribing of antibiotics. Highly recommend.
1061,2,this is not even worth the $1.50 they were asking for it ... this is not the fault of the shops offering this set it is just the way it is packaged.
1062,4,"I don't know what I was expecting when I went into this novel, but I liked this a lot more than I thought I would. It's definitely more deep and emotional, not light and fluffy. It was one of those books I didn't want to put down, I just wanted to keep going. I read almost all of it in one sitting, a rarity for me nowadays.<br /><br />Seven years ago, Rowan was led to believe that she was responsible for killing her baby brother. Her family is broken, with a father who holds her in contempt, a morbidly obese mother who sleeps all day, and younger sister that is out of control. Rowan just wants to get good grades and get out of this place.<br /><br />Honestly, when Mike was first introduced, I thought it was going to be one of those &#34;Girl has huge crush on super hot, really popular guy who shockingly does pay attention to her but turns out to be a joke/he's a huge jerk/something&#34;. So I am pleased to announce that Mike actually was just a nice guy.<br /><br />I liked Rowan. She's been dealt a hard lot in life, yet she still stays focused on her goal, of going to college and getting out of her terrible house. I can't begin to imagine what it would be like to go through the things that she did. But Rowan was a very complex, well-rounded character, and was very well written. I ached for her when sad things happened, I felt happy for her when (rare) happy things occurred. I felt the myriad of emotions right alongside Rowan.<br /><br />I also like how Meyer spotlighted on deeper issues, like cutting. Rowan is a very strong character, and it was nice to be able to see inside her head for issues like this.<br /><br />The pacing was well-done also. Even in parts where not as many things seemed to be happening, there was never a lull or a time when I was bored with the story. And maybe I was just too caught up in the story to think about it, but the twist in the end did catch me by surprise.<br /><br />This was a very good book that I would definitely recommend. Meyerhas a great writing style that will suck you in and hold you. Even if this isn't your normal type of book, I think you would enjoy it. But be warned, this isn't something light and fluffy. It is definitely deeper and more emotional."
1063,5,Same book I was issued to teach my class.  I ordered to be sure I had the book by the time the class started.
1064,5,"For Americans, Zen Buddhism can be a very difficult concept to grasp, especially if written by a native Japanese or Korean Zen Master. This book is written by John Daido Loori, an American Zen Master, from an American perspective. If you want to learn authentic Zen Buddhism, look no further, this book is what you need."
1065,5,My daughter wrote in this wonderful journal daily until every page was filled. It's absolutely adorable.  You can't go wrong here!!
1066,5,"For those of us who have had a lifelong yearning to do something with purpose, this is an inspiring and compelling story of one person who defied convention and did something amazing.  I could not put it down.  The book is well written and has great lessons.  It's amazing to me that someone so young could be so wise.  Read it."
1067,5,"This book arrived quickly and in good condition.  So many neat ideas.  It is hard to stop quilting.  So much fabric, so little time."
1068,5,"Dr. Rupert Nacoste's transitions from, 'the academician and ProVost of Diversity' to Wayne, 'the man with a heart who loves his family and friends', provides a nice balance of a spiritually guided gift to lead, speak, and command attention to an humble and grounded man. The overarching themes that spoke clearly to me were academician, diversity, culture, and similarities.<br /><br /> Academician -  As a junior investigator, I feel forewarned about the career path I am choosing. Dr. Nacoste outlined what I need to do to be promoted and why I have not been promoted yet. I learned that my experience as a faculty member is not unique. Dr. Nacoste was recruited for a position and did not get it. He also were recruited for a position and was threatened to be fired several times. He did a good job, but that still was not enough. I also learned that what I despise about politics is not going away. The best method appears to be to learn to tread the muddy waters.<br /><br />Dr. Nacoste taught me how to 'act' like a faculty member.<br /><br />Because I read this book, I have been mentored, inspired, educated, and grounded.<br /><br /> This book made me laugh out loud, say, 'uh huh', cry, smile, and frown. It evoked so many emotions for me. I know, right now, that I could read it again! And I cannot say that for many novels. I am an avid reader and enjoy a novel that allows my imagination to make a clear picture. I thank you for the opportunity to read your book. It was truly a pleasure."
1069,4,Good book - worth reading. Informative and interesting. Gives backing to Churchill's statement &#34;Why should we assassinate Hitler? He's our BEST GENERAL!)
1070,5,"Retellings scare me.  I know that's probably not the best way to start off a review about a retelling of a story.  But any time a movie is remade I usually cringe.  No matter what you're always gonna compare it to the original.  And to be honest it's rare that the remake is ever going to be better.  And to take a story as iconic as The Great Gatsby and flip it to a modern day version is a risk, it's a huge risk.  But boy did this pay off!  I loved this book, from start to finish.  It was just so fresh and clever.<br /><br />If I were a teen reading The Great Gatsby in high school, I would have loved to read this along with it in case there were parts that I missed or didn't understand.  The author chose to have the mysterious and captivating neighbor next door be a blogger.  Which I thought was really genius because celeb blogs are really popular these days.  Take someone like Perez Hilton for example.  He is considered to be a celebrity, and he got his start by having a Paris Hilton fansite.  And from there he started blogging about other celebrities, and his career took off.<br /><br />The heart of the novel is the main character Naomi.  Naomi is hard not to like.  She's a pretty normal teenage girl, even if her mother is rich and famous.  She's very grounded and you can tell she's a genuine person.  I enjoy characters like this in contemporary books.  It's makes it for a smooth and easy read, when the main character is likable.  I think it's also how I would hope I would be if, I were to suddenly have access to money and pretty much buy anything I want.  I definitely am not rich, so I definitely cannot compare my life to hers.  But I loved how she kept a normalcy.  But on the other hand I smiled at her going to lavish parties and wearing Marc Jacobs clothing.  I love when people live their life to the fullest, and for Naomi that summer at the Hamptons she definitely did that.<br /><br />But of course there is scandal, and there is a bunch of juiciness.  I ate it all up.  It was bold of the author to have the role of Gatsby be a female.  And even with knowing where the story was heading, I couldn't help but like Jacinta.  And when her story eventually unfolds I had a sympathy for her.<br /><br />I think my only criticism of Great would be that a lot of the symbolism in The Great Gatsby was lost.  Things were mentioned such as the green light and the billboard, but it's done sort of in a way that it's almost a passing thought.  And unless you were looking for it, you wouldn't know it was there.  In a way I felt like they were just thrown in there, and I would have preferred that they have been left out.<br /><br />Overall this book is a gem.  It was a great read and I would recommend it to anyone who love YA contemporary.<br /><br />Reviewed by Sana @ Step Into Fictionall up.

1071,5,A great blending of graphic novel with historical text.  The Art of War by Tzu is beautifully interwoven in the story told throughout this graphic novel
1072,5,"Preschoolers really enjoy this book because of the ending.  Gives facts about a wolf eating meat, but in the end he is sensitive to the lamb.  Good character builder."
1073,5,"One of the most valuable books I've ever purchased. I'm a young writer trying to build a portfolio from home and the amount of advice given in this book is priceless. I'd pay $100 for this book knowing the quality of information it contains and in such abundance. Over 100 interviews with the people that you want to work for. If you're an advertising student or someone trying to break into this industry on their own, this book is a MUST HAVE."
1074,5,Love this touching story of a blind kitten. Well written. A good first-hand account of the author's experience during 9/11.
1075,2,"What a disappointment...where to start?! PS. the review has some spoilers so don't read if you don't want to mess up ur book reading…<br /><br />Here's what I DIDNT like about the book:<br /><br />1) REPETITION....You can't believe just how much of this book is repeated...the dialogues, the thoughts, the doubts, even the scenes with the dog and his &#34;water-closet&#34; accidents are repeated...it's as if the author counted think of any events or forgot that the characters had already said that sentence! The whole story is built on 2 repeated arguments that Colin and Angeline have with themselves…she feels guilty about what she caused her family by the loss of her reputation (this is the cause for both her WANT AND REFUSAL to accept marriage to Colin…don’t ask me how) and He is obsessed with the house and what it means for him and what he should do to acquire it…and then the whole book is just these same thoughts over and over again…and some added boring scenes with the mother and sister that I find utterly irritating.<br />2) And the dialogue…my God! It’s like listening to teenagers talk on a cell phone! Low substance, and inconsistent to a degree that just want to make go “Really?! Some editor actually approved this?” and the switch in opinions in one conversation would drive u nuts! E.g. he plans to seduce her but feels bad about it, but he has every intention to go through with it… and then he talks and tells her to go to sleep and tries to stop her from touching him and reason that this is a bad idea and he respects her…ON THE OTHER HAND, SHE says she won’t allow him another kiss cus she was burnt before and she learnt her lesson and she doesn’t want to get her heart broken….and then SHE tries to convince him to get into bed with her and take off his cloths?! Really? aagghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh<br />3) There was no realistic development of characters...Colin just went from being 31-year old total wastrel and rake to just a nice good son, brother and a perfect lover to Angeline...Angeline never actually developed! I can't believe there is a more confused and unstable woman at her age and at that time!<br />4) The back of the book says that “…unfortunately, the only woman he wants is the one whose heart he broke years ago”…no where in the story is there a mention that these Colin and Angeline had been romantically attached. Just that he came to her come out drunk and he was supposed to dance with her but she refused. Since they are of the same age, born only 1 week apart, I would imagine that he was around 17 or 18 at the time…HE would probably have not been attending the come out in the first place, supposedly he would still be at Eton at that age…regardless, the story doesn’t show WHY they didn’t like each other and what exactly happened, so I imagine it wasn’t a big deal…but defiantly they were not in love as the summary says…<br />5) I understand that back in the old days the woman’s reputation would be hurt if she breaks her engagement but come on! She discovered him having sex with a slut of a lady, he opened the door half naked, she slapped him in anger and many people witnessed this…how is it that it all got on her head and no one condemned the man or the woman who was having sex with him in a bedroom during a social event?! The other thing is, how is it that both her father and brother didn’t do anything to defend her honor???? I hated her father cus he is such a wimp!<br />6) I read a lot of historical romance novels…most if not all say that a woman by the age of 24 or 25 is considered a spinster and with almost no hope of marriage…Angeline was 31 and they still thought that she has time to catch a husband? Plus, there was no proper explanation why she wasn’t really married…yes she was waiting for love but come on…she was a duke’s daughter with a fortune of her own and she’s pretty…dono…just doesn’t work out…<br />7) Also, a lot of the details of the story just don’t add up…a house that was left unopened for 25 years CANNOT be cleaned by ONE maid in 3 or 4 afternoons!!!!!! The maid would go in for few minutes and announces that the dining room had been dusted! The place sounded like it has been kept closed for few months not quarter of a century! And it has only one mouse  how cute!<br /><br />There are more things that bugged about this book but I won’t waste any more time on this review…I DON’T RECOMMENT IT…don’t waste your money and time…"
1076,1,"I was skeptical of the reviews as they seemed fake. I think I was right. It was a very dry and boring read. It's full of stats about obesity...we get it. It's highly focused on counting calories. Who wants to/has time to do that? Only good thing to say is that when I went to return it, amazon let me just keep it and still refunded my money."
1077,3,"In many ways, this is the perfect R.A. Montgomery CYOA book, in that it encompasses his classic elements:<br /><br />(1) your parents are dead;<br />(2) you are living with an uncle;<br />(3) an international crime syndicate is somehow involved;<br />(4) the story involves several exotic means of transportation;<br />(5) there are voodoo references; but sadly also<br />(6) \\""Once there, you will be faced with endless questions to which you know few answers.\\"" (page 87)<br /><br />Interestingly, the illustration on page 17 of the Voodoo Store storefront contains an image unmistakably evocative of a hemp leaf.<br /><br />The premise of this book is good.  You parents have recently died, and you live with your only other living relative, an extremely wealthy bachelor uncle who is involved in a lot of mysterious stuff.  One day, when you return home from school, neither of the two household help is around, and in the study, an rare and expensive dagger is stuck, point first, in the middle of the floor, with blood everywhere.  An exotic sportscar speeds away from the house, and you follow on your new fancy motorcycle.<br /><br />Interesting, right?<br /><br />I won't say this is a bad book, but there is no consistency, and only very rarely do you get something remotely involving a resolution.  Sometimes, the handyman is a such a prolific jewel thief that his haul is carrying not in envelopes, not in purses, not in suitcases, but fills up entire Egyptian coffins!  Sometimes, it is suggested that your uncle in involved in this, while other times your uncle merely figured out what he was up to.  Another path finds your uncle performing a voodoo ritual behind the voodoo store, where it is suggested he was brought back to life.<br /><br />In all of the other endings, you never figure anything out, and never know what your uncle was up to, except that he might be an undercover FBI agent.  However, Uncle Morgan is a pretty cool character, even with most of the details missing.  Iwas interested to learn more about him, and frustrated that we never really did.<br /><br />This book reminds me of the Lost Jewels of Nabooti, because there is no resolution, and no apparent solution to what is only the vague hint of a mystery.  If there was a good ending here, it would have been a 5 star book, but it really lacked that one more page explaining everything and tying your observations throughout the story together.  Maybe some people like things more open-ended, but I prefer some closure.  Anyway, it is definitely not a bad book, and even the fervent RAM-hater should find something redeeming here."
1078,5,"Emotional and thought-provoking, The Reappearing Act can be tough to read at times because you can feel Kate pouring her heart out onto the pages. That said, I thought it was a page-turner and read it from start to finish in one sitting.<br /><br />Although Kate's story is about coming out, I think that the content transcends the gay community, and I also found it to be the story of a young woman figuring out the path to success and happiness, and how sports helped her in that process."
1079,4,It was a good book about the F86 and Mig15 .I was expecting it to be info. from the pilots.
1080,5,These recipes sound really good.  I am waiting until our harvest to try many of them out but I think I will be enjoying this book for many years to come.
1081,5,"I had this book when I was a child, and read it to my own children. I bought it now for use in my Pre-K class. The kids love the story and enjoy anticipating the Kerchoos when Robert is about to sneeze. This book can be used for horses, policemen, letter R, etc."
1082,4,"Full disclosure: I bought the book but haven't read it yet, just the table of contents and thumbed through it. And yeah, I usually hate reviews from people who say that, so feel free to ignore mine if you feel that way too. I'm giving it 4 stars because, as I said in the title of my review, it's probably great for parents of teens, and will probably come in handy in a couple of years.<br /><br />But as the parent of an almost-10-year-old, I have to point out that while the word &#34;tweens&#34; [and I hate that word, BTW] is on the cover, that appears to be very nearly false advertising.<br /><br />So, for those who will find this useful, here is a listing of the chapters:<br />1. When Your Sweet Child Morphs Into a Sassy Teen<br />2. When Smart Teens Do Really Dumb Things<br />3. When Your Trustworthy Teen Pulls a Fast One<br />4. When You and Your Spouse Disagree<br />5.

When You Catch Your Teen Drinking or Smoking<br />14. When Everyone is Completely Stressed Out<br /><br />I'll try to update this review once I read the book, but it just went to the bottom of the queue."
1083,3,"2.5 Stars. A quick read and easy to get through, but I had a few problems with it. First off, it was a book about a 30 year old woman, but the writing style felt very YA. Second, although there were some amusing Austen parallels, I felt that overall it was a rather clumsy reworking of Austen's works that didn't work too well. I especially disliked the ending - there was no real build up to or development of the relationship, and the &#34;Darcy&#34; factor just wasn't there."
1084,4,"This book is great, except I don't know about the amount of ingredients.... But, the filling recipes are great. It gives many many suggestions and ideas on how to make great ganaches."
1085,5,A must chart when reading early European Anglo/Norman/Scottish/ French history in trying to determine who's married to whom in the political intrigue of the royal class.
1086,4,Last year presented many challenges for me. I fasted and prayed for guidance but it seemed like God was silent. That's when I started reading this amazing book. Navigating Your Seasons of Change helped me to put some of the things I went through in the proper perspective. As I read each chapter I began to understand how God was using this book to give me wisdom for my journey. I can't even imagine where I would be if I never read this book. I am certain that we all can benefit from a little wisdom every now and then. I believe that this book is the perfect place to start.
1087,5,I love this book. I own a copy and bought another one for an artist friend as a gift. He loved it. This is my favorite Shaun Tan book.
1088,5,Remember the story of the thirsty crow?The crow was thirsty and it could not reach to the water.So it decided to throw pebbles into the water container.Now the crow has one advantage...and what was that...It has all the pebbles it needed.The story resembles the events that took place in the director's life of &#34;one rupee film project&#34;...But alas...The makers of the one rupee film project did not have enough pebbles to quench their filmmaking thirst.So they decided to collect pebble(money in this case) through crowdfunding.This book contains the makers' journey of pebble collection.An interesting read...an honest depiction of the journey...
1089,5,this provides a very good history of Mardi Gras and its traditions.  information is short and easy to read.  the pictures are wonderful.
1090,5,"Loved the book! It has the perfect mix of mystery, adventure and humor, with great descriptions of the beautiful lands around Big Bend. Garcia is high on my list of favorite authors."
1091,4,"Really enjoyed this book, basically written from the future and from our world of the sword of truth series.  Awesome."
1092,5,Needed a reliable road atlas in addition to the navigation system in the car.  This atlas LOOKS great and is easy to read the maps. WILL get much use over the next couple of years as I will be traveling alot
1093,2,"There are many places of the book worn. Not as good as the product preview said. It is ok, but not perfect."

1098,5,"I was considering getting this book for friends' children and wanted to read it first. Loved it! I had to re-read the first few pages a couple of times to make sure I understood, but after that, I was sucked into the book. Lovely book, lovely characters. Very different from what I remember reading when I was the age of the intended audience. The kids in this book are mature and street smart, not just book smart, and are the type of good people you would hope your own kids would be friends with. I had read a couple of reviews that suggested that there was too much dependence on adults to get to the end, but I didn't find that to be the case unless you live in a world like Peanuts where no adults ever seem to be present. More of a sign that the girls did as much as they possibly could on their own, knew who and where to go to for help, and did seek out help, just like any person, child or adult, would and should do. They also did their share of helping adults along the way. Fitzgerald's book is straight talk to her audience but also age appropriate. I think that kids will appreciate the way that several &#34;grown up&#34; topics are presented and not babied but addressed straightforward for what they are and were. Fitzgerald is saying to her audience, you are old enough to thoughtfully consider these issues and form your own judgments. Meanwhile, I managed to learn a lot about art history that I knew nothing about, and it was certainly worth the time I spent reading it to walk away with a great storyline, memorable and strong characters, and beautifully worded descriptions.  A pleasure to read and I highly recommend. I am back to buy additional copies now for friends."
1099,5,"Very interesting book. I enjoyed the main story line of the crash of flight 4422, also the insight of Captain McGregors struggles to find out what really really caused flight 4422  to vanish for over 50 plus years. A very good read."
1100,5,"What a very, very cute book for the Grandkids.   When our Grandkids visit,  I never know how to keep them entertained and happy.  Since our Grandkids enjoy being read to this is the perfect book for them.<br /><br />We all want our children and Grandchildren to be respectful, and this book, The Scotties Learn Respect,  helps to explain respect so a child can understand it.  This book will also help your child understand why they should listen to their parents.  Terry"
1101,5,"We enjoyed this witty little book with its delightful illustrations, and gifted it to some young kids and adult artists.  The artwork and the words complement each other well.<br />The reactions from everyone were terrific.<br /><br />This book is now on our list of gifts as was 'Goodnight Moon' and others over the years.<br />I hope there will be more from the artists.  We will keep a lookout for their art when we are next on Cape Cod."

1104,1,"OK, the sun, the moon, and the International Space Station (and Mars) all revolve around the earth. Please provide the mathematical equations that can be used to determine the period of those orbits, your estimate of those periods, and the values of the parameters used in the equations.

1105,4,"The mists of an Ireland coastal town enveloped me as I lived in the atmosphere of not only the ruins of Kilmoon church, but also the damage wrought when a child never knows the love of both a father and a mother.  Ms. Alber's debut novel not only kept me guessing at every turn, it also made me care deeply about the characters whose lives she so intricately wove together until the final knot was tied or was it severed?  I anxiously await another adventure in County Clare."
1106,1,"I have been in the e-commerce and digital advertising business for many years now and I buy a lot of books. I ended up buying this one out of curiosity. This is one book that you should stay clear from - it reads like a shopping TV commercial without any substance. If you are just starting out, stay away from this book because it will teach you nothing. Waste of time."
1107,3,"I am a huge Doreen Virtue fan and I also love this book, so five stars with regard to its content.<br /><br />However, the book's pages are entirely colored - which certainly sells well on the US market.<br />The ink they used (printed in China) literally gives me a headache whenever I open it and I already got it a month ago when it came out.<br /><br />While the images themselves are adorable, I - as a sensitive Earth Angel - would rather pay more money and get a book that is printed on recycled paper without strong smelling chemicals. I enjoy reading spiritual and esoteric books, but I don't see any reason why this would justify harming the environment or my own health.<br />So from that point of view I was quite disappointed."
1108,5,"Una lectura amena, con muy buen humor y a la vez profundo. Muy buena imaginación de la escritora que cautiva desde las primeras páginas."
1109,5,"This is the best fantasy novel I have read in quite a while.<br /><br />Nineteen-year-old Maia is the youngest son of the current emperor of the Elven lands. He is also despised by his father, due to the fact that he is the product of an arranged marriage with a goblin. (Elves have light skin and eyes, goblins have dark skin and red or orange eyes; both have big moveable ears.) Not wanting to deal with his half-breed son, the emperor has isolated Maia on a remote estate with few companions. However, when the emperor and all his other sons are killed in an airship crash, Maia finds himself thrust onto the throne, a position for which he is ill prepared. He has to learn how to be emperor, which is made more difficult by the fact that some of his new subjects aren't particularly happy with his rule. And then there's the fact that the airship crash that killed his family wasn't an accident . . . .<br /><br />If you are a lover of fantasy novels with a lot of action--sword fights and pitched battles--this isn't the book for you. This is a character-driven coming-of-age story, where the main character learns how to be both a man and an emperor. Instead of swords, the book features court etiquette and court intrigue, which in the wrong hands could be boring. But Addison does such a masterful job of making Maia a likeable and interesting character and of building a nuanced, interesting court (and world) for him to inhabit, that I was engrossed in the story from the very first page and sorry to reach the end of the novel.<br /><br />The world Addison builds is so fresh (hard to do in fantasy these days) that I really want to see more stories set it it. As far as I can tell, there are no humans in this world at all, just elves and goblins. But the elves and goblins aren't fairies and monsters, just people who look different from each other. And this isn't a quasi-medieval setting, but a world at the beginnings of industrialization, with steam-powered airships and other devices--and yet these steampunk elements are kept in the background and don't overwhelm the story. It's just a fascinating blend of elements that feels completely unique to me--and I read a lot of fantasy, so that's hard to do!<br /><br />I would recommend that anyone reading this book read the excerpts from the traveler's companion at the end of the novel before starting the story, because they will help the reader make sense of things like naming conventions and titles that can be a bit hard to follow. And be prepared to consult the glossary a lot--there are many characters and places referenced in the book, and they can be hard to keep straight. The use of antiquated language (wouldst, art, etc.) and of linguistic conventions like the use of a formal plural (not just a royal &#34;we&#34;, but for all characters speaking formally) also make the book a bit more challenging to read.

It's just a fascinating blend of elements that feels completely unique to me--and I read a lot of fantasy, so that's hard to do!<br /><br />I would recommend that anyone reading this book read the excerpts from the traveler's companion at the end of the novel before starting the story, because they will help the reader make sense of things like naming conventions and titles that can be a bit hard to follow. And be prepared to consult the glossary a lot--there are many characters and places referenced in the book, and they can be hard to keep straight.

1113,4,I bought this book for my daughter's 4th grade projsct so dhe could &#34;mark up&#34; the text as she was studying Mandela.  The price and devivery were good.
1114,5,Beautifully written! I felt as if I were there every minute of the read! I can't wait for Joan's next book to come out.
1115,5,"I highly recommend this to ANYONE - I think it has something to offer to just about everyone I know, i read it twice back to back when It first arrived. Recommended by a friend & I intend to pay it forward ~ This book incites the imagination like no other book I have ever read... I hope to see more work by this author."
1116,5,"Easy and well written. Great insight to the war, strategies, and personnel.  Honest evaluation of how US strategy was flawed."
1117,5,"The story strikes the imagination of the young and old.  My eight year old grandson read the book with amazement, wondering how a horse could tell the story.  The story is interactive and helps teach map studies across the USA. It is the kind of story you have to read more than once to catch all the details."
1118,2,It could have been a better book coming from Martha. I  Would not recommend this book to anyone for tips.
1119,4,"A good and useful book for those wanting to know about the uses and applications of DMSO.  I didn't find it as good as the one by Dr. Walker though. I would suggest you get Nature's Healer by Dr. Morton Walker instead. Even though it's more technical and a bit more harder to read, it has more information and more thorough."
1120,5,"I have all of the hungry girl cook books and I have been waiting for a very long time for her to come out with a diet book, I have tried several other diets and have always failed, I alway find myself re losing the same 5 pounds over and over again, with that said, I bought the Hungry girl diet book the day it came out and I began following the diet the day after it came out, I am also using beachbody workout programs, currently I am doing slim in 6 in addition to starting the hungry girl diet and I have to say my curiosity got the best of me so I decided to check my weight 2 days after I started, I was not expecting to see much of a change if any and I had already lost 3 pounds, 3 pounds in 2 days, that has NEVER happened to me, I will be following the hungry girl diet for quite some time. I have already seen results and the diet is very easy to follow and the recipe's are very good, something you do not see in other diets, the hungry girl diet is something you can make into a life style change to continue to lose weight as well as maintaining your weight loss.. Thank you Lisa for writing this book!!!!!"
1121,5,"This small, weatherproof, reference guide is pretty awesome. It's pocket sized, and with a brass grommet, it holds the 12 front and back printed pages together very snug. Very useful knots to learn, and like a previous review stated, pack this and a couple feet of paracord in your pocket, and you can practice anywhere, anytime. This went right into my EDC Bag, after going through and completing every knot at least once. For the price, this is a great reference tool to have on you all the time, and a great overall buy. I can't find a negative thing to say, hence the 5 star review, but in the same breath I'm no &#34;knot expert&#34;. I'm sure there are hundreds of knots that could be useful in everyday life, but I have found that the knots covered in this particular item do me just fine."
1122,5,"Superbly written,  with good versification,  this is the poetry of nature with colorful,  neat illustrations. Pleasing to the eyes,  enchants and inspires children."
1123,3,Got this because it was on my daughter's wish list for her baby.  It is too delicate for her right now but as she gets older it will be just fine.
1124,4,"In this highly illustrated book, the author has done a good job of presenting the Bujinkan martial arts. From the headmaster's biography, lineage, history and unarmed training to advanced weapons lessons, Mr Borda shows his dedication to the source material. This book is a welcomed addition to my martial arts library and is recommend for Bujinkan students."
1125,5,"Beautifully written. My daughter read through these so fast! She couldn't put them down!! This is a great beginner chapter set, the illistrations are beautiful as well!"
1126,5,The book was sold as used but really looks new. The content is as I had hoped and the study is going very well.
1127,3,"We liked Dr. John Chung's SAT II prep book, and purchased this book for Calc AB test. However this book probably needs a revision or two to correct some of the mistakes/typos.<br />Very useful format, just like before."
1128,5,This was an amazing story of Captain James Riley and his crew getting shipwrecked then getting taken into slavery.  They spent 2 months going across the desert to get bought back into freedom.  The crew was ravaged. Riley went from a man of 240 pounds to a man of 90.
1129,5,"This is a rare and great book by a fantastic American Artist, when it was difficult for women to excell in the arts"
1130,4,"easy to read, put in library to add with many other books.  Nicely packaged. Thank you.  AA+++ AAA++  interesting book  but not one I would recommend."
1131,5,"My six-year old granddaughter can't get enough of these. Reading them builds her language skills in a way that is fun for her, which is just what you want."
1132,5,I am a big fan of A.C.Arthur books. I have decided to buy all of her books to keep them in my library .
1133,5,"I must say, when I started this book I was a tiny bit put off by the sheer volume of clever Victorian historical detail. But as I continued, the author's style quickly grew on me and I adjusted to her pace, finding this to be a very entertaining and satisfying cozy.<br /><br />Lacing everything with a refreshingly sly wit, Julia Stuart creates a vivid sense of place and time via all the details, as well as a cast of quirky, endearing and three dimensional charcters. And the mystery is quite satisfying, illuminating darker sorrows hidden beneath the veil of stiff and silly Victorian manners.<br /><br />I loved this book and recommend it highly!"
1134,5,God's love and desire to bless his children comes through clearly in these meditations by Juanita Ryan.  She conveys a deep understanding of God's compassionate heart as well as our human failure and need for His forgiveness and grace.  I have read through all of these meditations with a group of friends and continue to read them on my own for the spiritual sustenance and reassurance they offer.  I have also given this book to more than 20 of my friends and family to be a source of encouragement to them.
1135,5,To Cross to Ocean is highly readable enjoyable story written by a most promising author. Mostly recommended for an afternoon reading when the evening breeze starts coming.
1136,5,"I discovered Mary Alice Monroe as an author last summer.  This book was written some years back but the story about the women in the book club is timeless.  I don't do spoiler reviews but if you haven't read this one by Mary Alice Monroe, I recommend it.  I would classify it as &#34;chick lit&#34; for us chicks over 50."
1137,5,"Alien and Creatures is must for anyone planning or currently running the Doctor Who rpg! Like a sonic screwdriver this essential element enhanced and saved the day for my gaming preparations. When this arrived I was expecting just a book and found a massive amount of creature reference card with great pictures and stats. THIS WAS AWESOME! I'm a dad that runs games but has very little time to write and transfer book to file information even for a fun, but fairly system like Cubicle-7's Dr. Who. The Dr. needs his TARDIS and sonic screwdriver: YOU NEED THIS BOOK and SHOULD BUY IT!"
1138,2,This is not a book of known Latin American dances and it should be very difficult to play them if you are not familiar with them beforehand. I would not risk buying this collection. .It should have come with a CD.
1139,4,A book seriously and scientifically correct. It has a light and flowing style. Describes the whole saga of our great family of hominid.
1140,5,"I received a copy of Business Storytelling for Dummies by Karen Dietz and Lori Sliverman from the Amazon Vine programme.  I was not sure what to expect.  Storytelling in business has become a revolutionary tool to help increase employee and customer buy-in when you want to get people on board with the information that is presented. If a compelling story can connect what is too often the details of business that many find boring, you can increase your success.<br /><br />An quick outline for the book includes:<br /><br />Getting Started with Business Storytelling: Its role in business, getting started, how it can help your business and how story is defined as well as how to dispell many of the common myths surrounding storytelling.<br /><br />They Why What How and Who of Business Storytelling<br />What Makes a Story a Story<br />Stories to Have in your Hip Pocket: Founding, what we stand for, what we do, overcoming barriers, memorable customer service,<br />Listening to What Others Have to Say and Capturing it.<br />Moving People to Action: Creating Compelling Stories&#34; Crafting a Story, Polishing a Story, Getting a Story to 'Pop' and Creating memorable stories.<br />Expanding and Contracting Your Story, Getting Comfortable Telling Stories, and much more.<br /><br />The book has turned out to be a treasure trove for me and it has really got me thinking of new ways that I can use storytelling in my work with clients that goes beyond the norm.  I would highly recommend this book for executives, salespeople and anyone in a media department or client  and public relations departments."
1141,4,"I find it sadly interesting as it delivers a very honest recounter of the most dynamic 10 years on the Street from someone who had all and lost all.  His story is amazingly dramatic.  Let me put it this way.  How many 30-year old masculine guys would spend 5 minutes of \\""corner time\\"" and not walk away from the job after being blamed for a mistake he may not have committed?  Or a guy just leaves his party behind when steps outside for a smoke and take a taxi without a word of his whereabouts to the remaining three gents.  It is sad that people with the authority and access to the capital can act enormously demeaning; yet, they don't realize it.<br /><br />I am familiar with craziness of the sales and trading business culture as I personally worked on the floor of one of the bulge bracket houses in the boom time.  However, his story is beyond what has been the normally heard on the street.  It is worth a published book and maybe a movie.<br /><br />Do not think of this as a classic though!  The world of finance is not functioning like how he describes in 99% of the time.  He is the ultimate outlier and cannot represent the mainstream.  Take it with a grain of salt!"
1142,2,"This is required reading for my daughter's homeschool program but it was not the original book or it is heavily edited. I wish Amazon would clarify this in the description.<br />If I am searching that specific title by that author any deviation, editing or re-writing should be noted clearly in the book description."
1143,4,"A pediatric ICU nurse should be able to keep her own baby alive. Morgan Adams didn't. The loss cracked a rift between her and her husband Tyler, and it's been widening ever since. When kidney failure threatens her life and none of her loved ones are a donor match, Morgan can hardly muster the will to care. Her mom has other ideas, though, willing to go to her biological father for help ... if he'll give it.<br /><br />This book puts the Bloodline in the Trilogy, because Morgan's father is none other than Dr. Thomas Reeves, also the father of Lilly Reeves (the protagonist of the first book). This time around, he's trying to create super soldiers via brain surgery--with covert approval from the Department of Defense. Beyond photographic memory, Reeves's neural graft blesses and curses his patients with flawless autobiographical recall (a definite plus for any spy). But some of these patients are strangely ill. When Reeves won't divulge why, three of them commandeer the PICU at gunpoint and threaten revenge on his daughter, as well as her staff and her young patients.<br /><br />This is Ms. Redwood's best novel yet. Her prose is at its cleanest (despite too many similes, which oddly I don't remember in the previous books). Her author voice remains clinical and factual, but the reader isn't pushed to arm's length here. Also, as usual, an impressive amount of plot is jammed into this book. The murder mystery and the scientific mystery and the medical cases--everything is balanced so well. This story is a bumpy ride for the characters but never for the reader, as Redwood executes each twist with smooth skill.<br /><br />And the pacing--the pacing! Stellar, really. The first half is a blur of buildup; the second deals with the hostage situation (and yes, I'd consider the hostages thing a spoiler, except the publisher included it in the blurb). In unskilled hands, the second half could have dragged a bit, but this author keeps tension high, and not in a static way. And just as I might have said, &#34;I can't take any more--um--peril!&#34; the climax exploded, then settled into a satisfying resolution for each character individually and the series as a whole.<br /><br />Now, the characters. I loved seeing them all again. I expected more of Keelyn and Lee, but the book is brimming as it is, and they showed up long enough to play vital roles and for me to smile at their presence. Brett's perspective was unexpected and enjoyable. Nathan's action moment in the climax was cheer-worthy and perfect. And of all the recurring characters in this series, Lilly's arc is the most complete. She truly changes from the first book to the last, and the catalyst for that change is believable. I'm also grateful to Ms. Redwood for giving Nathan the closure he still needed at the end of POISON, though I didn't see him as often as I wanted to (but where would he have fit more often with everything else going on?).<br /><br />As for the new characters. The loss of Morgan's child could have strayed into a cliche, but instead, she feels like a genuine, fractured person. Her motivations make sense, as do those of Tyler and Dr. Reeves and even the villains. And how I loved Morgan's perception of the characters I already knew--meeting and admiring Lilly, talking to Nathan and Lee on the phone and mentally contrasting them.<br /><br />Which brings me to point of view, the ultimate make-or-break for any novel. This one is Redwood's deepest yet, showing us the world through the eyes and thoughts and even emotions of her characters.<br /><br />The themes of the novel weave organically through the events. This time around, we're challenged to define a few elementals: memory, family, duty, guilt, and humanness itself. Thankfully, Jordyn Redwood is still a believer in wrestling evil, not whitewashing it. She doesn't shy away from poking her reader's soft spots (or ramming a hot poker into them).<br /><br />At the end of POISON, I hoped the author would give all her damaged people an honest, non-formulaic dose of healing. She does. I can say goodbye to everyone, especially Nathan and Lilly (I mean, if I must), knowing they'll be okay in time. I can even imagine what's next in their lives together.<br /><br />As a smart, suspenseful, hopeful, daring work of Christian fiction, I salute and recommend the Bloodline Trilogy.ed people an honest, non-formulaic dose of healing.

1144,5,"Adorable, cute quick read for your little ones. Good for kids learning to read too! It is very well illustrated also."
1145,5,Ordered this book due to it had lots of great wonderful Victorian era pictures that I hope will inspire my drawings.
1146,5,"If you want sugar-coated advice, then you will not find it in Snickering Out Loud.  However, if you are ready to put your grown women's panties on or your manly britches and swallow the tough pill or don't cry when it cuts against your grain or strikes a nerve, then you are ready to withstand this book.  It delivers the raw truth and reality of dating hiccups while also providing no-nonsense advise on the art of smart dating.    I love the introduction of Jenny's life before she gets into the meaty stuff.  She bears nearly all and shares her funny stories as she makes her exodus from childhood and her teenage years, into her college life and the \\""real world\\"" experiences thereafter. Her quirky descriptions of those moments in time when we have those wild phases, brings this book to life and will have you laughing until you're crying. My favorite description was the reference to \\""her heart sinking into her anus\\"". If the words in this book don't say enough, the pictures definitely say the rest. She invites us into her life, her family, her reality and it makes you  feel like you're right there on the same page with her. At moments, I was convinced that I was related to Jenny. As you read along, you may find that there is a Jenny in all of us. For instance, you may be able to relate to her educational journey. She started out in one major but transitions to another, and one degree later, discovers it wasn't for her. She then revisits her initial passion and shadows others in the field, then later finds out that wasn't everything she thought it would be. Then she finally pursues her dream. I can personally say that I've been there..a couple of degrees later. What makes the introduction worth the read in itself are the learning experiences that Jenny shares along the way.    Finally, the meat and the gravy of this book is given in hefty servings from Chapter 3 all the way to the end. It begins with Jenny's own \\""red flag\\"" moments and lessons in fruitless relationships. I think at some moment in time, we've all had a \\""Frank\\"" or found ourselves asking our friends why they were with \\""Frank\\"". At various points throughout this book, it reads like a survival guide which, in my opinion, is helpful especially to anyone contemplating a big move to an unfamiliar place. Snickering Out Loud also addresses those \\""red flag\\"" types that we often make the mistake of dating whether we are young or older. Jenny mentions the \\""S******\\"" who we find ourselves being the financial provider for. Then there is the \\""narrow-minded\\"" type who doesn't support our dreams. The list goes on and on with those all too familiar life lessons, and  funny-yet-serious scenarios to go along with them.    This book definitely takes you through a journey of self-discovery from the dating standpoint. Snickering Out Loud is worth the read and anyone who's sick and tired of making the same dating mistakes, should take the time to pick up a copy of this book. You may find that you were waiting for a book like this."
1147,2,"My daughter does not like this book. It does come with stickers and a tiara, which we are saving for potty rewards. This book is almost solid pink, no color contrast, which may be why she doesn't like it. She does like &#34;big girl panties&#34;"
1148,5,"This is a really really good book if you want to learn something, I think it was just a book but I really like it."
1149,5,Marshall Mason is one of the theater's greatest directors.  It is an honor to read so many insights from such a gifted artist.
1150,5,This book is wonderful adjunct to Scripture study offering a very unique perspective. Don't miss out. I highly recommend this book it really brings a very unique lens to your study.
1151,5,I could not put this book down! Kenney Hegland captured me with his wonderfully enjoyable tale of an American law professor and attorney who rides like Quixote into windmills of injustice and leaves them thrashing on the ground. The enchantment of his writing puts him fully in league with attorney-authors Grisham and Lashner. And surprise: it is all true! I loved every word of it.
1152,5,"This hardboard book was an ideal find for use with my preschool grandchildren as it held their interest. The book is very visual, durable, and interesting. Dinosaurs' physical features, their classification, and habitat are discussed."
1153,5,"This is great! Bio rhythms are better than horoscopes. You can plan your month to when your physical, intelligence, & emotions are high.<br /><br />Beware of them when low or when you are have a double crucial day.<br /><br />A must for everyone."
1154,2,"Although the picture of the book shows a CD, this does not come with one.  Many of the reviews talked about the CD, but other reviews are not getting the CD either.  I would not order if the CD is necessary."
1155,5,"This book could be the basis for curriculum for geography, history, art, etc for kids, yet it is written in a way that they will understand and connect with. Well written and very interesting. You want to read it to see how it ends."
1156,5,A great read.  A little book that you carry around with you and refer to often.  Down to earth and realistic.  Enjoyed it thoroughly
1157,1,"It is a splendid story and I like the way Jill Paton Walsh has continued with the unforgettable characters created by Dorothy L Sayers.<br />I first discovered Lord Peter Wimsey when I was still at school and when I read Busman's Honeymoon I thought that was the end of all the stories ! But after all, it wasn't - he has, at last , married the girl he has courted for so long, But this new authoress, of whom I had not previously heard, has miraculously created more stories of this couple and now, in this book, their sons."
1158,5,EXCELLENT ITEM AND TRANSACTION
1159,5,"Mr. Honsinger hit a deep fly ball with his first book here. It may end up out of the park, but time will tell - I'm waiting for the followup to make that call.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- It's not all guns and blast em science fiction. In fact, there aren't hundreds of battles in the story. It's more of a leadership / person driven story that follows our hero, Max, as he takes his first command, along with the relationships he has with his closest subordinates on the ship.<br />- The political dynamics between the humans and others come into play several times, making this more than fly in with guns blazing and superior technology that dooms most sci-fi. Enjoyed that part, too.<br />- There's no ridiculous sex scenes or gratuitous need to make her love me parts to the story. Another sci-fi trope avoided.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- None. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and read it from start to finish in one sitting. Some may find the historical references a bit obscure, but I loved challenging myself to think back about things I knew I should know.<br /><br />I suggest you pick up this book with great celerity."
1160,5,"Vic does a great job making the reader feel as if he was right there, experiencing the adventures. I could hear the twigs cracking under my feet while walking along the paths of Isle Royale as I was reading. My heart was in my throat more than once, and if I didn't know for sure that the author and his buddy Ken are still alive, I would have been very worried about them during the title story of the book.<br /><br />You'll experience a full range of emotions during while reading these true stories--loving the adventure every step of the way."
1161,5,"John's approach to building a law practice is entertaining. You wouldn't believe that a lawyer could show you how to build a legal practice and make it entertaining however he does.<br /><br />The brutal honesty in the book is what makes it so powerful. It's like your looking over John's shoulder as he tells you mistakes he made in painful detail and how you can avoid them.<br /><br />While the book provides instruction on how to build a legal practice it is by no means boring for those who think it might be. For any lawyer, regardless of specialization, I would recommend this book. It's a must read for all in the legal profession."
1162,5,Very informative and I love the recipes.  It is nice to get back to basics.  Try the Fermented Ginger Ale.
1163,5,"This is a fun, easy-to-read guide to Oregon Breweries.  Though we have yet to take the trip ourselves, this is a fun and informative read for any True Brew Fan.  It just brings the places to life and makes you want to go there all the more.  Enjoy!!"
1164,5,"Sometime between 1975 and 1979, just out of high school, I had this book out of the public library numerous times as I explored everything I could find on the subject of painting. The Symbolists caught my attention more as an idea than as painters (most of them weren't that interesting as painters, except for Redon) whereas the Pre-Raphaelites dominated my direction for years to come because of their vibrant colors.<br />In 2014 I'm back to those early influences. The subject matter of all the art in the late 19th Century is tiresome regardless of where the artists fell in the moral spectrum. And the Symbolist ideology now seems embarrassingly absurd (and how they went on and on about souls explains why I would see a desiccated and moldy cucumber from last year's garden as a manifestation of my own soul). But I still sympathize with their otherworldly aspirations as they attempted to make art that was a fuller expression of the human psyche than what was seen in the academic artists or the materialism of the Impressionists, and that is an dream that permanently affected me.<br />As to this particular book, it is excellent. Philippe Jullian had a thorough knowledge of the subject and wrote very well. Unlike his book Dreamers of Decadence, in this volume almost all the artists and works mentioned in the text are illustrated. To get the most out of the book be sure to read the notes on the text and plates, which do a great job of fleshing out the main text with small details and anecdotes taken from friends and foes of the time. Also, in this volume his writing is more informational, staying clear of the chattiness of Dreamers of Decadence (in that book it was too often like he was talking to a friend who had already spent years with him in the same galleries and knows the material almost as well as the author).<br />Do I have a place for one small complaint? The columns of type are too wide, which makes it difficult to track the text and it's easy to skip a line or two as your eyes move left and right. Petty, but still annoying."
1165,5,"This book is not just a tribute to the winner of  the Annual Queen Leah Literary Achievement Contest. It's a tribute to some outstanding Women who just happened to be of African descent. If someone needs some information about today's woman, this book is for you. March is Women's History Month order this book in celebration of Women in History."
1166,5,Well written sewing book that doesn't assume prior knowledge but only gives instructions on achieving high quality to professional results. I am an experienced home sewer and pattern maker - my work would have achieved proffessional results much sooner if I had started with this book.
1167,5,Book is great and it came in good condition. This book came in handy since I was able to use it for two different semesters and classes.
1168,2,"This was my first Lisa Scottoline novel. Given the popularity of this prolific writer, I was anticipating a legal thriller of John Grisham quality. But a few chapters in, I felt more like I was reading one of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum mysteries.  Not that there's anything wrong with Ms Evanovich's fiction; I happen to enjoy one of her books every now and then; it just isn't what I was expecting in this case.<br /><br />I based my two-star rating on some key points in my criteria for readability:  (1) It did not grab my attention right away. I had to make an effort to keep reading in the early going. Even more noteworthy, I had to make an effort to finish it.  (2) I did not especially like the main character, Mary. Granted, I do not know her history from the previous \\""Rosato\\"" series so maybe that would have helped, but still I found her wishy-washy and spineless, especially when it came to her fiancee and family.  The reader is supposed to believe she's this kick-ass attorney, but she's so submissive that she won't even get herself a parking space because macho boyfriend might feel threatened by being reminded she makes a lot of money.  (3) There was enough  extraneous \\""filler\\"" that I found myself skipping over it to get to the actual plot.  I kept wondering where the Tony characters fit in and finally figured out they had no purpose other than a lot of pointless dialogue.  (4) The ending.  I had correctly guessed the guilty individual and his motive, even though it had barely been discussed in the earlier chapters so that wasn't much of a revelation. The loose ends were all tied together but seemed disingenuous, not a natural course of events. The SUV sequence was a real stretch as far as believability.  And in particular, I thought Mary's private conversation with Jane Gardner regarding her intimate activities was completely out of context, given the very businesslike nature of their relationship up to that point, not to mention none of Mary's bees-wax.  (Sorry, had to get the \\""bee\\"" pun in there somewhere.)<br /><br />As I said, this was my first Scottoline novel.  Other reviewers have said that her earlier books are much better so I might give her another try someday, but not until the sting of this one has worn off (again - sorry)."
1169,3,"Reads like an a first novel. Choppy, too many acronyms. Very disappointing. Not anywhere in the same league as Vince Flynn or Brad Taylor."
1170,3,this one was ok.  i dont even think i finished reading it.  it was pretty elementary.  but good for someone who doesnt understand men at all.  i do love leman.
1171,5,If you like the Harry Bosch series the Mick Haller ones fall right in line. Fast paced a great read.
1172,5,"I want to thank Deborah personally. I bought this book before and read it. I am not sure what happened to it so I had to buy another. I love the book. It came in brand new condition. It really is so great to meditate on. Such a small book, but each chapter could take a week to reflect on. I love how she is upfront and biblically blunt. She doesn't beat around the bush, but gets right to the point. If you are looking to tame your tongue read this book! It helped me overcome so many issues and get at the heart of my tongue issues. This book helped me improve my relationship with my parents and friends. I am so so thankful for this book. I recommend it to everyone. There has to be at least one chapter that relates to you."
1173,5,"I became a vegan for health and ethical reasons in January.  There are a plethora of vegan cookbooks out there, most, disappointingly only superficially healthy - they simply replace the standard white sugar, white flour, butter, etc. with brown sugar, agave nectar & honey, butter with vegan margarine, and meat with processed soy foods.<br /><br />This cookbook, on the other hand, utilizes the nutrient-rich greens, vegetables, and fruits promoted by such nutrition and health authorities as Dr. Joel Fuhrman (&#34;Eat for Health&#34; - highly recommended for the how's, why's and what's of American eating habits and how to change them for the better).  I made a pot of her &#34;Kale and Cannellini Bean Soup&#34; yesterday, and it just makes me feel so nourished and good about eating.  My husband, who has really cut back on animal products (eggs, butter, dairy, red meat, fish) thinks the food I've been making is super tasty and makes him feel healthier.  The preparation is easy, the recipes easy to follow.  There are no pictures here, but I don't miss them at all.  Very good cookbook, highly recommended.  If you're interested in learning more about veganism and eating healthy foods, I also suggest to you Victoria Moran's &#34;Main Street Vegan&#34; and Kathy Hester's &#34;The Great Vegan Bean Book.&#34;"
1174,5,"This book is a must read for every project lead and senior ADF developer. It gives an excellent overview of how an ADF team should be organized, the tools and methods to use to aid the development process.<br /><br />This is not a technical guidebook on how write ADF code or solve complex technical problems, there are other books (and Oracle manuals) which cover that. This book takes a step back away from the technical detail and focuses on the bigger picture of the software development process. I think this perspective is lacking from the usual development guides, technical blogs and programming courses.<br /><br />As an ADF developer for many years I could still learn a lot from reading this book. It will save me time on investigating new trends in Continous Integration, Load Testing, Automatic builds, Skinning, Customizations and more, the book gave me answers to the questions of which methodology I should use for architecting my next ADF project - at least it gives me a nice headstart in choosing the supporting tools and processes.<br /><br />Although the book's title refers to Enterprise Applications it will help in smaller projects too. Every aspect of the so called Enterprise Applications needs be considered for smaller applications as well, some will be considered not needed or irrelivant but that choice must be made based on facts that can be found in this book.<br /><br />The book refers to the (now) latest version of Oracle JDeveloper, 12c and discusses some of the new tools integrated therein. But still applies to the 11g versions of JDeveloper and ADF.<br /><br />The book goes through the process of building a small (and functional) application so it is also a nice introduction to ADF development.<br /><br />So if you are a project manager willing to learn a little about ADF Development or an ADF Developer willing to learn a little about project management this book is well worth reading."
1175,5,This book should be read by any licensed life insurance agent.  The concept is timeless.  Many authors have embellished Nelson Nash's concept without the credit that he is due.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone that is interested in establishing long term wealth or setting their children  /grandchildren on the path to prosperity.
1176,1,"I was excited to try this since I met someone who said it worked for he, but there was nothing different than  we have known for years."
1177,4,"I love reading books with a little history lesson. This story grabs you at the beginning and takes you back in time. It's a love story, a treasure hunt, a peek into Indian life and a history of the Ozarks. The author paints the picture perfectly, I couldn't wait to find out what happened next! I highly recommend this to everyone!"
1178,4,"A useful organizational summary & breakdown of all the tasks of moving.  Good detail  Nothing particularly unusual, no special, extra tips.<br />I ordered very late in moving process, just a few days before movers arrived to pack and load.  For me the notebook was mostly reassuring to read and see that I had covered all the bases and items listed in the book. (pheww!)  Would be most useful a couple months before moving, to help remember all the items and plan the timing and best order for getting everything crossed off the list."
1179,5,There is a lot of great information in this book.  It is up to date enough for the machine I got.
1180,5,Very informative account of the finding of St. Peter's relics. I highly recommend to those interested in the full story.
1181,5,Love her and this book. Skipped some chapters but she tells us all her secrets. She needs to write another one.
1182,5,"I've been a Dorothy L. Sayers fan since I was a teenager, so it was a delight to find that Jill Paton Walsh has written a new pastiche based on the characters Sayers made so popular.<br /><br />It is now about 1952 or so. Jill Paton Walsh picks up the story of Lord Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane, now the Duke and Duchess of Denver, as the Duke finds out he is the hereditary Visitor of St. Severin's College in Oxford. The College is in turmoil and dead bodies are turning up. Much is made of the fact that the killings are mirroring Harriet Vane's mystery novels. Walsh stays true to the great characters and style of Dorothy L. Sayers, while dealing with political and social issues in post-war Britain.<br /><br />Write many more of these, Ms. Walsh!"
1183,5,"David is very black and white and whether one is amillennial, preterist, or continous historical it will have some insites that one may have forgotten or enjoyed learning. A dispensationalist will not. The book and scripture allows for the kingdom as future prior to Pentacost and present tense from that point afterward."
1184,5,Wisdom is knowledge that is gained by having many experiences in life and this book is full of it!  A hidden gem I would recommend to a reader looking for snapshots of circumstances and how one man's insight teaches lessons we can all benefit from through life.  The stories are full of advice and sometimes just reflections on life for the reader to take away thought provoking experiences.  This book can be read and reread as each chapter stands alone and can be revisited for it's message.  A great addition to my home library that will be passed on to my children!
1185,5,This is such a great book and so fun to read for both child and parent.  No matter what time of day. This is a classic book that you HAVE to have for any young child.  Fun and captivating for all young children .  My 14 year old still knows all the words by heart.
1186,5,"The story of 17-year-old Holden Caulfield stepping from a cloistered life into the real world one weekend is as strong a symbol for rebel-meets-reality as has even been written. The problems I have with the story and the same ones I have always had. Author J.D. Salinger pretty much wrote about himself as Holden -- angry, terse, brilliant, cynical -- in order to separate Holden from a naive run of the mill man newly come of age in this soft, lying, backstabbing universe his parents and their generation created. As I watched Salinger live out his own life until his death a few years ago, he struck me as playing out Holden's days with all of those attitudes. And of course, he never published another novel, retreated to a little traveled town, and rarely came out to play. What is interesting is that he wrote some manuscripts to be published after his death, so hopefully we will get to see the rest of Holden's life unfold -- including, I understand, heaven.<br /><br />My final prayer is that, inasmuch as he has passed on,  I hope a copywriter has the good sense to trim Salinger's three- and four-page paragraphs. They are giant walls of text that are the literary equivalent of the Berlin Wall."
1187,1,I was hoping for the original book and tape that I had for my younger children but this cd was bland
1188,5,"My 11 y/o son loved both Exploring Creation with Zoology 1 and 2 and is asking for more. It's not dumbed down but also easy to read and well-illustrated. Good for homeschooling, good for Christian families."
1189,3,Good book for Kids who enjoy reading and parents who likes to read. however little expensive in my opinion. thanks
1190,5,I wanted to thank the author for pouring his passion into his book and I forsee this as being a future movie.  This story depicts family and the test of faith that life brings.  I laughed at myself when I found my head mimicking the one female character talking in a Southern accent.  Job well done Mr. Petermeier!
1191,5,This is a good book all about Cavett and it is so informative that you will want to read it all night.
1192,5,The writer has a very easy to read and casual tone in describing different fruits and how they work with other fruits as well as explaining the process of canning. I like that she included a troubleshooting section and little tips here and there. The whole book gives you a feeling like you are learning all of these from a dear close relative like an aunt or grandma.<br /><br />I love it and and will buy more as gifts.
1193,5,"I saw this book come up as a recommendation from Amazon, and then saw it in a Vidimus book review. I bought it on a lark and couldn't be happier.<br /><br />As a historical re-enactor/re-creator this has proved to be a wonderful resource. It has a painted image before of a glazier at his workbench including a few tools. It includes a picture showing abraded flashed glass up close, with inaccurate scratches. It also shows a heavy sampling of heraldic glass, a personal interest of mine.<br /><br />If you are active in researching historical glass methods and techniques, I strongly recommend this book."
1194,5,"I read &#34;You're Not Doing It Right&#34; when my kid was 2, and your honest despair SANG to my dark soul. She's cooler now (just like you promised) but my tendency to run weekends like a circus has caused super early case of &#34;I'm Bored&#34; during seconds of downtime. I will use this fun book to teach her that she, in fact, is boring, and really needs to just get it together. She doesn't get the lesson yet, but we both like the flamingo."
1195,3,"Some of the information in this book is helpful and applicable. A lot of it is unnecessary. The forms are nice, but much of them are unnecessary for running an LLC.<br /><br />Everything is well organized, easy to consume. Downloadable forms are a nice plus.<br /><br />Most of this information is readily available online for free."
1196,5,I'm doing research prior to an upcoming trip to the islands and this book has been a great resource .
1197,5,This is a great gift for high school or college graduates.  I love the storyline of the book and they arrived in perfect shape and on time.  The twin high school graudates I gave these to as a graduation present LOVED them.  :)
1198,5,i believe this is the one that i got but i think that my book has a different front page.  a good story about high school enemies.
1199,5,"Yes, I know. Stephen King can be a polarizing figure for some. Yes, I know he used to write horror (and sorta still does, though more and more his work has taken on a slightly sci-fi bent). But this is simply a great book about writing that every writer should read.<br /><br />First you get an interesting look at his personal journey, which is entertaining (the guy is funny, I tell ya) but also illuminating from a craft standpoint.<br /><br />Then you get a substantial look at the craft of writing, along with some great advice.<br /><br />All of this is done in the incredibly accessible yet masterfully literate voice that King has managed to develop over the course of his writing career.<br /><br />I recommend this to all writers, whether it is when I'm teaching a seminar, having coffee with another writer, or any other opportunity I get. And I re-read it myself every year or so. Along with Gary Provost's MAKE EVERY WORD COUNT, it's the best book on writing I've yet read."
1200,4,"Over all, this book was good and had a lot of good things to say.  I think it should be on the bookshelf of every serious programmer.  I thought Code Complete 2 was a little better, but on the other hand Pragmatic Programmer is shorter and seems easier to read."
1201,5,David Roper is one of the best resume writers in the country. In this book he shares many of his real life experiences working with many very different clients (including me). This book never got the attention that some other books on job hunting did and I think that is unfortunate. There is a lot of timeless information in this book that is easy to pull out without reading it cover to cover. It has been out of print for many years. I bought it used through Amazon years ago and just purchased an unused copy to send to a young friend of mine in Seattle who is looking to change his career.
1202,5,"I could not put the book down, I had to keep myself from jumping ahead. I read it in two days! It makes you truthfully wonder about what the government does!  Are we headed this way?"
1203,5,"The story was great, the artwork even better. I love this movie and I hope the artist and writer continue to publish these stories. If you are a comic fan or movie fan, pick this up."
1204,3,It was very informational but I did expect it to be his personal story. But I still learned from it.
1205,5,Very prompt!  Got it just before I needed it.  I have the series!  Love it; love it; love it; love it!
1206,5,This book has been on my wishlist for several years. My local library is not very well stocked in my interests... I have made several items from this book and have had many lovely compliments. One of my two best purchases for 2013
1207,5,I bought this for my 10 year old son and he read it in a few hours and now knows even more about mine craft.
1208,5,Loved this book! Gave me some good laughs and passed it on to another preto friend when I was done!
1209,5,Awsome this could rate up there with j r r  sure it will stand the test of time. Just hope the next six volumes are not as long in the making
1210,1,First of all the author is trying to write a &#34;book&#34; on &#34;Hindus&#34;. Author has no clue of what &#34;Hindus&#34; mean and does not know what he is talking about. This book is an (nonsense) extrapolation of Spielberg's depiction of Hindus in &#34;temple of Doom&#34;. DO NOT WASTE YOUR RESOURCES ON WENDY'S STUPIDITY.
1211,4,"Although it is certainly not the end all be all of studying for your OB/GYN rotation, this book is good for a quick review."
1212,5,"I've been reloading a very long time, and am always just a little concerned with the content of any new book on the topic, this book is very well written, is easy to read and a good value. The author is well known in the shooting community and like his articles, the book is informative and well illustrated."
1213,5,"Bigfoot is real, and he's a policeman.<br /><br />After screwing up a case for the thousandth time, he's assigned to Missing Persons. And when he stumbles upon what it looks like a serial kidnapper, things got really weird.<br /><br />I loved it. Kevin Shamel is a smart Bizarro author, who weaved an ecological themed Bizarro story. The main character is bizarrely lovable and relatable, his partner is hilarious, the situations are serious and the action is presented in a way that makes it not boring or excessive. It's a good, well written, smart Bizarro story.<br /><br />So, why aren't you reading this NOW?"
1214,5,"I read Lisa Copeland's book The Winning Dating Formula for Women Over 50 and found myself agreeing with the things she said about men to be very accurate. It is very obvious that Lisa has talked to a lot of men to get their perspective so clearly. What was interesting to me as I read it as a man was that I could see myself in these pages and ask myself if I qualified to be a quality man in women's eyes. I knew the answer to be 'yes' but it was also nice to get validation. I think Lisa's book is a must-read for women who are venturing out into the dating world again as they enter their 50s and 60s and beyond. The ideas are very well written, backed up by real case studies, and easy to apply, and try. And these ideas, tips, and strategies will work for men, too. Give it a read."
1215,5,Wonderful reading voice really enhances an amazing book.<br />Read the book the enjoyed revisiting it in the car with family.
1216,5,pete is a favorite in hour house. the moral of the story is wonderful and my child loves the pictures.
1217,5,"Prairie Grace was a book, once started, I could not put down. Not a typical practice for years.<br /><br />Marilyn Bay Wentz’s skilled writing intricately blends historically accurate Colorado life in the 1860’s, importance of faith and romance development. At the end of the book I desired to know more…such as what came of the families transitions. Prairie Grace could easily emerge into a series yet if not I am certain I would select another Wentz book due to the enjoyment of her writing style."
1218,5,The combination of humor and vivid descriptions of the animals and their habitat provide engaging reading.  Durrell also manages to find unusual people and situations on his quest to identify and capture animals around the world.
1219,5,I purchased these for a seven-year-old girl.  She absolutely loves them and is well on her way to finishing this set!
1220,5,"Dick Davis is a traveller that is able to weave his way into the fabric of the Mexican people by his genuine interest and love for Mexico and its history.  He artfully brings along the reader on his journey via the buses that traverse Mexico and makes you see how such a commonplace way of travel can yield a wealth of memories.<br /><br />Note that this book is in black and white- for a color version of the book, choose a Kindle download."
1221,1,"I was so looking forward to this book and just sat down tonight to read. I'm worried that I won't be able to make it through the introduction, however. The author (presumably an accomplished woman in her own right) uses stereotype after stereotype to describe the very real financial complexities facing stepfamilies. In her examples, only men pay alimony, only women receive child support, only men support stepchildren financially, only men have wills and insurance policies, only women \\""stash\\"" money. Argh! It is painful for me to read. I happen to earn more money than either my ex-husband or current husband, have paid alimony, and most certainly have a will and insurance policies. We have the financial complexities she describes regardless of gender, but it is nothing less than insulting to women -- especially those of us who have become even stronger and more independent because of divorce -- to assume that we are all dependent on the males in our lives. Please, please, please update your language so that others don't immediately give up on the book and reject your important advice like I fear I might be doing if things don't improve in the next few pages!"
1222,5,My wife is a big fan of classic movies and I bought this as a Christmas present for her.<br />The book is full of wonderful pictures and fun facts about the movie.
1223,5,"This guide has a lot of great information about hiking and walking around Orange County. It gives you important history about parking, whether there's facilities like bathrooms/water, difficulty of trail, etc. The author also includes info about the area, plant life and history. Make sure you read the hike description all the way through. I found that there often was info on shorter hikes that branch off from the main hike included in the body of the chapter."
1224,5,Stop what you're doing and buy this book!!  You will be sad when it ends.  I hope the author is busy on his next novel.  BRAVO!!
1225,5,"Ordered 2 of these, 1 for me, 1 to share with a friend.  If you're looking for a true New Orleans cookbook, this is it!!"
1226,5,"Step-by-step on all the different settings that can be made on my Galaxy S4.  It has come in handy several times for me.  Very thick manual, pain to lug around, sometimes wish it was available as an ebook."
1227,3,I was so disappointed to receive this lovely and inspiring book and not have the cards that went with it. I specifically purchased this book from this vender because I figured I'd get the cards too.. false advertisement!!!!
1228,5,Another fabulous research book to add to my library.  I would recommend it to anyone working in the area of CIA activities.
1229,5,"This is a magical, sweet and thoughtful picture book where Ms Dudley has created a charming forest  world and its inhabitants with startling &#34;aliveness&#34;.  Hank, the title character, is a gentle being.  He takes the time to do a very small act of kindness, and sees how this action...his action, can directly affect the lives of others in a very meaningful way.  Children learn that you don't have to be big to make a difference, and even small actions of kindness, have a big impact to someone.  An FYI:  Adults love this book, as much as, children do.  My husband's face grew into a bigger and bigger smile as he turned each page."
1230,5,Love the many yummy recipes in this entertaining book it has been a great help to transition to the vegan lifestyle!
1231,5,Thank you
1232,5,"If the phrase &#34;Oxford Encyclopedia&#34; doesn't convince you of the excellence of this work, the name of its general editor will, namely, John L. Esposito, one of the finest scholars of Islam today. This is a majestic survey of the worlds and times of Islam; I would go so far as calling it the paragon of Islamic studies. I have been reading in these four volumes for at least nine years because many libraries have it in their reference sections. I taught a World Religions course to High School students for many years, and this encyclopedia was my vademecum in informing myself about Islam so I was prepared to teach my students. Many of them followed my lead and used as a secondary resource in writing their assignments. The volumes cover a range of issues and subjects: religion, philosophy, science, politics, history, biography, art, literature. The articles are NOT exhaustive and are NOT primarily addressed to scholars. In fact, this encyclopedia strikes me as one designed for the common reader. It fulfills the function of a threshold which brings us into Islam, provides us with an escort (all those scholars, like John L. Esposito) and provides a map for further research (bibliographies at the end of every entry). That said, I find the various entries rich in information, points of view, controversies, sympathies. One remaining issue: If it is available in many libraries, why did I buy my own set? I can only respond by invoking my love books as books, and my life-long desire to live in a library. Yes, my apartment is set up as a library with bookcases in every room - den , living room, dining room, bedroom. I'm like Montaigne who wrote about his library, &#34;I leaf through now one book, now another . . . I'm full of cracks and leak out on all sides. I have no memory.&#34; This encyclopedia is ideal for leafing through, and it rewards re-reading to refresh my faulty memory. You owe it to yourself to satisfy any curiosity you have about the worlds and times of Islam by leafing through these volumes. You will find yourself hooked as I am and start reading it in earnest entry by entry."
1233,4,"Dr. Hahn recommends that we realize what happens when we as Catholics partake of this sacrament.  He brings old truths to new light in this books.  I always learn something from reading his books.  The only problem I have with some of them, this one in particular, is that he gives such a dizzying of scripture references for some of his points that by the time I have looked them all up, I have lost my original train of thought!  That sid, please read his books.  They are all well done and worth your time."
1234,5,"My brother and I both love the Virgil Flowers series of books written by John Sandford.  I had already read this one (library copy) and loved it, so I got this copy for my brother for Christmas.  He is loving all of his Christmas books and I love that I can get them on Amazon so much cheaper!!"
1235,5,"Secret of the Thorns is a real page-turner that thoroughly entertains.  Once I started reading it, I could not put it down until I finished it.  I am looking forward to reading the rest of the Donavan series."
1236,5,"How to even being? This book is life transforming. This book opened my eyes to perspectives, ideas, and Life. This book needs to be required reading for every kid who goes through school. This book teaches practical, common sense Life skills.<br /><br />For the man or woman who truly is sick and tired of the daily B.S. The daily grind at a dead end job, or even the individual who is looking to create prosperity for himself and other around him. This book is for everyone, however only the thorough bred will ever finish this book. The authors style is very direct, and some parts do become a little dry, while other parts will have your eyes glued to the pages and all of a sudden the chapter will be over. While this book talks about money, there is a much deeper meaning back of the pages.<br /><br />Incorporate this book into every aspect of your Life. As a a student of Napoleon hill since December of 2012 this book is changing my life as I type. I have given this book to three other people."
1237,5,Joseph Prince goes fullforce with his committment on Grace. He is definitely on target. The book is easy reading and has scriptures to reference.
1238,4,"The Official CLEP Study Guide is a wonderful resource to use for practice tests that are formatted the same way as the actual test.  It doesn't give you topics to study, just an overview of what the test will look like. I'm definitely using this book for the rest of my CLEP tests."
1239,5,Am new to the diet-part way through book-really did not know much before and so far getting a good background-had heard about it here and there and then was asked to help with some images-as a result became curious and have felt it to be a worthwhile read thus far-am not much for dieting but a lot of it seems to make sense-pretty comprehensive and I like the explanations-glad to have this resource all in one book
1240,4,"This novel covers a tense 16 hours with time creeping slower as the reader get deeper into it.  We watch this happening from several viewpoints, the slow moving time juxtaposed with shifting viewpoints intensifying the suspense as religious fanatics take over a tube train in Britain.<br /><br />Slightly flawed, this is still fascinating action with well delineated characterization."
1241,5,Among the best books I've ever read and I read a lot of books! It's very difficult to put down and even though it's over 1000 pages I still finished it in a few days.
1242,5,"I really enjoy Lawheads work.  There have been reviews of Lawheads work that state characters were uninteresting et al, however, I have not found that to be the case.  I've enjoyed Lawheads work since he wrote his first novel back in the early 1980's  Always thought that he departed from the Science Fiction genre' too soon.  Glad to see he  has returned with the Bright Empires series.<br />Its not Tolstoy or even Steinbeck but its still a very enjoyable read."
1243,5,I purchased this cookbook several years ago and have since given copies to all my relatives.  All recipes I have tried have been delicious and I think this is one of the best soup cookbooks I have run across.
1244,5,This book shows a wide variety of cars used by the  Wehrmacht.  The information is very good and the pictures are great.  I bought it as a model making aid and it has more than filled my expectations.
1245,5,I have wanted this book for so long! The book is wonderful and thanks so much for the sending it off so quickly! Thanks!!
1246,5,"Being adopted myself, I found a real connection with this story and found myself solidifying a long time decision of mine to try and locate my birth parents.  This book, along with the current science of DNA, has basically set a fire under me that has been smoldering for years now."
1247,3,"After reading Cesar's routine with his dogs -- hours of jogging (and all before lunchtime!), plus other exercises in the afternoon, I would only recommend this book to young, healthy, full-time dog trainers.  Sorry, Cesar."
1248,3,This goes deep into the background of the problems between the Apache and the whites. It is thoroughly researched but can be a bit dry in places.
1249,5,Law. Enforcement<br /><br />I'm a Police Officer and I needed this manual to study for a promotion exam. It was very helpful to me and some of the questions were directly from the manual or just plainly worded different. It also refreshed my memory on a few things I had totally forgotten.  Good book and good buy.<br /><br />.
1250,5,"Like no other devotional book.  It comes at you in such a personal way.  Jesus is talking to right to you.... not someone else discussing some spiritual point.  I have started reading scripture this way,  reading it more in the first person from Jesus to me directly... what a difference for me."
1251,5,I have not read it as yet but am sure I will love it.  I will read it shortly after I finish the other book I bought.
1252,5,"Bart is at it again.  More adventures, more thrills, some aches and pains<br />as he fights the bull!<br />wonderfully fun story with happy ending!"
1253,5,I have read this book to teens and college students alike. all have sat quietly like story time in kindergarten and looked carefully over each picture
1254,5,"I like a book that cuts to the chase and this one is filled with 100 short, pithy and wise suggestions for dealing with the news media. Whether you're a CEO, and athlete, a budding actor or anyone who finds themselves with a reporter's microphone in their face, you need to memorize this book. You won't be overwhelmed with theory, just reinforced with the best advice from a seasoned journalist."
1255,5,"I actually ordered two of the same book, one for each of my sons and everything was perfect. They were delivered on time, good price and perfect condition."
1256,5,Awesome book. I am so anxious to read the next in the series. I keep this authors work on my keeper shelf
1257,4,It 'a great start and then deepen my knowledge of individual nations with other books and especially with the help of the web.<br />Miles
1258,5,"I am over the moon for this recipe binder! The patterns are so lovely, I can't stop staring at it. There are folders to put your recipes in, and pages to write new recipes in each section. I've already combed through all my printed recipes and gotten everything sorted by category, PLUS, this lovely binder fits in my recipe drawer! It's so perfect. This will greatly improve my cooking life, because now all my favorite recipes are actually organized and not just in a stack of printed pages. It's fantastic! Highly recommended."
1259,2,"I could not get past the first CD of the audio-book.  The audio reader is a native Polish speaker, which gives the narration authentic quality.  HOWEVER, the author pronounces each word as if she were learning it for the first time, or as if she were trying to teach someone the English language.  It was absolutely unnatural speech, and painfully slow.  Pauses in all the  wrong places so some sentences did not seem to make sense and i had to replay them.  I looked at my  CD player to see if I could speed it up somehow but my player did not have that capability.  I just wanted a historical fiction (my favorite  genre) to listen to on my commute and had to return this to the library.  Could have been an  interesting story but I never got the chance to find out. If you must get the CD version make sure your player has speed-up capability or it will drive you nuts."
1260,3,I purchased the book for my daughter's school work assignment.  She didn't fail so it must have been what she needed.
1261,5,excellent book.<br />The authors know their stuff and definitely did a lot of research.<br />I am starting to tear down my 65 GTO Tri Power now and this will make it a lot easier to put back together..
1262,5,"Hunky rival shape-shifters, a feisty heroine, Native American folklore, a satisfying romance, and of course, smoking hot sex in the desert. What more could a fan of erotic romance want? Kathy Kulig delivers!!"
1263,5,Fishman has written a concise & thorough book for yoga practitioners and teachers who deal with back issues. Well written with terrific illustrations
1264,5,"We love just about anything by garrison . This was no different.my husband complained about my audible books, so I got him this to listen to on the road."
1265,4,"Very pleased with my Mary Engelbreit calendar.  Have liked some in the past a little more than this one, not enough &#34;hearts and flowers&#34;."
1266,5,I purchased this book for my granddaughter to help her to learn to sew.  Easy to understand instructions and illustrations!
1267,5,Book was for son's high school class.  It has a nice cover and came in good condition.  I am not giving a book review.
1268,5,this is one of the best recipe books I have purchased. full of awesome recipes. and great pictures. have tried many and all were good
1269,5,I ordered it for a friend of mine as I already have a copy and she was delighted with it...
1270,4,"This is the history of African-American self-taught artists who drove the highways of Florida stopping to paint the landscape as they<br />saw it before the age of super development.  Many of them have pass but a few relatives remain and are trying to preserve this type of art.  Currently, access to undeveloped land is one of their challenges.  The original Highway Men painted and sold their work along<br />the highways.  They have captured &#34;The old Florida&#34; that many of us miss."
1271,5,"I have read ALL of the Mitford series and WISH there were such a place and that the characters were real people. They are all so unique and add such warmth and humor to the stories. After the furst read, one feels like a friend."
1272,5,"The author takes a provocative position that raises a lot of questions about what really happened.<br />The most impressive part of this book is the fact that the author explains in a credible way motives of interested parties.<br />The book raises issues which should be addressed because of their historic importance. I doubt, however, that the political institutions will want this matter reopened.<br />Refreshing and a good read.<br />I recommend it highly."
1273,5,"Excellent book! Very thorough and quite in depth. Seems to have not missed many plants, if any.  I really like the descriptions of uses of plants by native peoples."
1274,5,"Anyone who wants to get a taste of strong Robust Reformed Theology Proper ought to read this book. Scott Oliphint, the professor apologetics and systematic theology at Westminster Theological Seminary does an excellent job in this book. My copy is heavily highlighted with notes and comments. The following are some of the points that stood out to me:<br /><br />- This work has a good discussion of aseity as a foundational doctrine of God: God is God and not dependent upon His creation or creature. From this point, it follows that God’s “essential attributes” are those that entail His independence (17). Also gave a good definition of Divine Simplicity (17-18).<br />- Oliphint gives a good hermeneutical principle concerning how to prioritize God’s attributes especially concerning passages that are anthropomorphic: “Contrary to what we have just noted, Scripture’s unity must be given priority in our interpretation of the various texts of Scripture. Muller denominates that priority as ‘ontological.’ He means that any and all texts of Scripture (and here we will confine our concerns to texts that deal with the character of God) that seek to tell us something of God’s character must be prioritized on the basis of the fundamental aseity of God” (27).<br />- The book is helpful in resolving the theological problem of how to account for passages in Scripture that describes God like man while also maintaining a strong aseity of Classical theism. I found it helpful his distinction between God’s essential attributes and Covenantal attributes in which the latter describes God’s condescension in relating to us. I think the term “covenantal” attributes is helpful even for those who might not subscribe to Covenant Theology.<br />- I thought I read the best nuance definition of antinomy and paradox offerred by Oliphint on pages 36-38.<br />- Interesting theological extrapolation from Exodus 3:1-14, pointing out Word Revelation and Deed Revelation, and how God’s deed in the Burning Bush tells us something about God: His presence with his people and also Him being self-sustaining.<br />- At first I thought it was curious that Oliphint was cautious of using the term “Creator/Creature distinction” though he agrees with the idea as taught by those who are before him such as Cornelius Van Til, etc. He has good reason: because God is more than a Creator, one does not want to give the idea that the essence of the distinction between God and all of His creation is because of His role as the Creator; rather, it’s because God in of Himself is wholly different. Oliphint chooses instead to use “Eimi/Eikonic distinction” as a better term, with the term “Eimi” to capture God as the true original.<br />- Book gives a good refutation of Middle knowledge including the Neo-Calvinistic version (99-105); it must be understood in the context of God’s free knowledge and necessary knowledge which was finely discussed before Oliphint’s critique of Middle knowledge. Here I am recalling Paul Helm’s point in another work of how Middle Knowledge is an unnecessary category in light of God’s free knowledge.<br />- Oliphint is helpful to points out two kinds of condescension by God: adoption and adaptation (124-25).<br />- I thought Oliphint has something stimulating to say about the issue of the incarnation. On page 142, he has a good discussion of how the human nature of man is anhypostatic (that is, impersonal) apart from the person of the Son of God while also being enhypostatic (“in person”) through the person of the Son of God.<br />- Enjoyed how Oliphint’s work was in conversation with systematic theology, historical theology, a tidbit of exegesis and philosophy.<br />It was beautiful to see Oliphint using the Doctrine of the Incarnation of Christ’s essential Divine nature and voluntary human nature to make us think about God’s relationship with us is much in the same way of His attributes He adds to condescend to us and His essential nature.end to us and His essential nature."
1275,5,"What struck me about ‘The Pet Loss Companion’, and what has remained with me since reading it, is the sense that I had been tenderly embraced.  Embraced through the affirming position that the loss of a pet is indeed the loss of a friend; that my grief was legitimate and that I was not alone.; that I was being deeply human when I acknowledged and honored the important role my pet had played in my life.  Every time I show the book to a friend, they ‘borrow’ it and I know I’ll not see it again.  But I don’t mind – this very easy to read and gentle book is something I intend to keep around for the next time one of my beloved furry friends depart this world.  A big and sincere thanks to Ken and Nancy."
1276,5,you get to own two classics in one book. I read these books for the first time and loved them both. 1984 to me is one of the best books out there. read them!
1277,5,I love books on tape on cassettes.  It is becoming harder to find these - especially the unabridged versions.  I have enjoyed this book and had no problems with it.
1278,1,"I didn't read much of it, but I read enough not to really trust  mr Vitale as a spiritual guide. He mostly feels sorry for himself while taking no responsibility for being a greedy Gus who will gladly charge 97. 99 for his stool sample and how people are finally having a problem with this and getting upset with him. I would rather make up my own hooponopono course and follow it by myself."
1279,5,I was so pleased to receive the latest in the novels by my favorite writer.  I rated this book 5-stars as the writer never fails to immediate draw the reader into his tail.<br /><br />Love Nicholas Sparks books.
1280,5,This book has everything needed to track your calories.  I would recommend it to anyone who eats many different foods and wants to know how many calories they contain.
1281,3,"This book was used in a bible study group that I met with regularly at my university. I found the questions in the points for reflection to be a bit tedious and silly at points, but overall the exegetical work done by the writer is well done. I think various group activities instead of just asking questions might be a great alteration to this text. These could prove better conversation starters and community builders as opposed to the reactions that many of the questions generated, that is, the &#34;clamming up&#34; that I and others felt at many points in addressing the questions."
1282,5,This book helped me more than any grief counsling I went to. Dealing with my sister's death has been very hard but with Mark Anthony's book I have found many answers I needed. Knowing your loved ones are always with you is so comforting. Mark gives us proof of this in his book!!!!
1283,2,I bought this book because I wanted to make a website so I can try to make extra money at home & it was still way over my head.
1284,5,"As a follower of Austrian art - my grandfather, Josef Josephu, was a sculptor in Vienna until 1939,<br /><br />I found this book fascinating. Its detail is astounding and well researched. It certainly made me think more about pre-war Vienna and how much that period affected the art world. A must read for lover's of Klimpt, and art in general."
1285,2,"The author should stop with their storyline. Not every story needs a nice, red bow at the end of it. Ella is a nineteen year old girl who has been verbally abused by her family and is plagued by anxiety attacks. She should not be pressured by him to get married. Please be realistic. He plays music and she draws, neither has real jobs or ambitions. She needs to find herself and both have to stop confusing sex with love. Oh that's right, she's 19!!! I loved the first book, everyone should read \\""The Secret of Ella and Micha\\"" but maybe let it end there."
1286,5,My daughter has 3 cats so I bought this as a gift to her. She loved it. I read through it also and found it to be hilarious.
1287,3,Another book about education written by people who know little or nothing about the state of the educational system as it currently stands.  The info in this book could be helpful if things were different but it's not realistic or practical for how schools are run.
1288,5,I bought this book for a friend who loves tide pools. It was a Christmas present and she loved it! She said it has great pictures and is very informative!
1289,5,"Wilkerson's book is outstanding. She is an excellent narrative writer, and deftly manages to correct pernicious myths along the way. The writing is beautiful."
1290,5,I gave this a 5 star because I love Sierra Club Engagement Calendar!  The photos are amazing and it has the perfect amount of space to write things on.  As always Amazon.com sends every package I get in 3 days!  I would definitely recommend this calendar!
1291,5,"Alice Korngold's newest work, &#34;A Better World, Inc.&#34; is an intelligent, intriguing, wonderfully written and riveting read. Ms. Korngold's years of experience as an expert in her field are clearly reflected in her ability to paint a compelling and clear picture of the intersecting worlds of business and social responsibility. This book will prove an invaluable resource, and not just for business people, board members and policy makers.  &#34;A Better World, Inc.&#34; should be required reading for anyone who cares an ounce about improving the world's social, economic and environmental problems."
1292,5,"If you are prior military and have seen some things then you need to read this book. It has helped me a lot more than I expected. I'm glad someone has written a book like this, I thought I was the only one who felt this way about war."
1293,5,Author Mark Montano is so crafty...the projects are easy and look great. I have all of his &#34;Big-Ass&#34; craft books.
1294,5,"I bought the book for my fall semester and it was good. Fast shipping. Not much highlighter, just the way described. Didn't use it as often as I thought I might, but it was a must for tests."
1295,5,Alice Oldford carefully describes the beautiful trails of Hunterdon County.  Her book is the perfect size for your backpack and she offers simple directions and instructions to the trails.  She also points of important sights to visit and things you won't want to miss.  Hunterdon County offers some of the most beautiful spots in New Jersey  - and Alice will help to make sure you get there to see them!  Have fun with this lovely book!
1296,5,"I have been sending my daughter  the Jan Brett series of  books for several years as part of her Christmas presents. She is a school teacher and shares the wonderful stories with her class. Our nearby book store has closed and it was a pleasure ( and wonderful convenience) to be able to order online. I got the product quickly and in excellent condition. We both love how Jan Brett books always have little, somewhat hidden,  pictures on the side of each page to enhance exactly what each particular page is about. Ordering from the comforts of my home at wonderful prices is an A+ for me!!!"
1297,5,This was recommended by my sister. Great price and arrived fairly quickly. I ended up paying about half of what she spent on the book. I mentioned that to her. Haha.
1298,3,Would have liked more specific info included.  Seemed basic. Advertising made it seem better than it actually was.  I would like more advanced cards
1299,5,"Great book, it helps people understand what is happening in an abusive relationship. Bought it for a friend who did not believe it until she started reading it. I got her to read it by scanning just one paragraph, she has read and reread  the whole thing!"
1300,5,"The only issue was the price of this item. I need it for work, so I had no choice. But it was just what I needed."
1301,3,This book is probably more appropriate for non-entry-level positions but is a good resource nonetheless.  A quick read with pretty solid advice for anyone looking to increase their salary.
1302,5,I know he's looking forward to fishing on the streams this summer.  It'll be great for his eye to hand coordination.
1303,4,Usefull for my practice. No other resource exists. Good upgrade from prior edition. I use it every day in my Oncology practice.
1304,5,"This was insightful to understanding manipulative people in the workplace. I always want to see the best in others, this was a good/simple read."
1305,4,"I read &#34;Poser: My Life in 23 Yoga Poses&#34; by Claire Dederer in 2 days. It's fast and clever and beautiful.<br /><br />&#34;Beginning is hard. But it's also lucky.&#34;<br /><br />Ms. Dederer uses yoga poses to divvy and dissect her life and realizations - a conceit that will probably weary non-yoga-enthusiasts, and annoyed me from time to time (and I adore yoga and credit it for much that is calm and stable in my life) (the structure also gets a bit forced as the book goes along).<br /><br />&#34;Time was a continent we walked across… I remember only patches; my memory is piebald, calico.&#34;<br /><br />But &#34;Poser&#34; is also funny and real.<br /><br />&#34;Now I am going to tell you the secret to a lasting marriage: Choose a spouse who needs to eat as often as you do. Bruce and I are like toddlers on a big day out. We need a snack, no matter where we are going or howling we are going to be gone. If we are headed out for dinner, we bring a baggie of cut-up cheese for the car ride to the restaurant.&#34;<br /><br />The trials of a modern American (white, upper class, liberal, Seattle) mother and writer are laid out in witty banter and often gorgeous poignant language.<br /><br />&#34;Now the words came out, irretrievable and hurtling, like young soldiers rushing to certain glorious death… The room went hot and bright. The lamplight spangled. There was a pounding in my ears like a bloody ocean.&#34;<br /><br />I had one nagging complaint throughout the book. I understand that children of divorce often feel unstable and angry and sad, and it's clear Ms. Dederer is all of those things (still) (but with just enough grace to afford her wacky post-modern (and IMHO awesome) parents some leeway). But while she finally credits her mother with being an agent of change and feminism, she never once seems to consider what probably would have happened if her parents hadn't split. Perhaps some semblance of stability would have been part of that equation, but what of the legacy of growing up with unhappy parents, determined to stay together no matter what? What do children absorb from watching their parents go through the motions of unstated or unfulfilled desires and emotions? Or from the voiced disappointments? What do they learn about marriage and partnership? Is it any better than instability? Personally, I think it's far worse. I find it hard to sympathize with Ms. Dederer's lament about wanting to grow up with two parents who loved each other. She had that in spades with her mother and stepfather, and her father was close at hand as well. I think that's pretty good odds considering the state of American marriages.<br /><br />&#34;It's my experience that beauty drags us by the hair into the real.&#34;<br /><br />Still it was a fun easy read - wise and witty and lovely - and I even learned a thing or two about yoga. One of her yoga teachers told her to &#34;find a skeletal alignment that was sustainable, that didn't need muscular support to be held for some time.&#34; I think that's exactly right, for me. To find a place to stand where your bones and posture do the work, and everything else can fall away, at least for a while.<br /><br />And her oft repeated mantra about learning to walk away from being perfect, from judgment, towards clarity and counterweight - this resonated with me. (I especially recommend this book to mothers - if you have a tolerance for yoga - but don't worry, it's not the om-shanti spiritual talk - Ms. Dederer appears to have the same knee jerk reaction to that as I do)."
1306,3,"It is not what I am expecting. The musical score is too easy, it is for the little kids, not for advanced or professional player. However, the hard copy is great."
1307,5,"The recipes are laid out wonderfully, the ingredients are easy to find.  The pictures are fabulous.  Plus, I like anything &#34;simple&#34; when it comes to cooking."
1308,3,"I am a long-time student of the Holocaust, and I was curious to see what this book could add to my understanding of the subject. It approaches the topic from a perspective which is somewhat more critical of the purpose of the Wannsee Conference than some other books I have read and tries to construct a balanced explanation of the actual meeting. The prose is not highly readable, but then again, this is a somewhat technical assessment. After finishing the book, I was not certain that I had really gained much insight on the underlying questions regarding Wannsee. Perhaps I was expecting a convincing argument about the meaning and purpose of the conference, when the historical documents don't allow a clear conclusion, but I have to compare the impressions left by this author with everything else I have read, and I just felt that the book describes too vague an agenda for what may actually have happened."
1309,4,"Baby loves Mickey and loves the size of these little books.<br />The only complaint is that the magnet on the box to keep the top closed is pretty strong for a little one.  He got a little frustrated when he couldn't open it.  It took a few tries, but he can usually do it.<br /><br />I still recommend these little books.."
1310,1,"If you are reading this, you're already on the internet.<br /><br />Congratulations, you've just finished half the book!<br /><br />What a waste. I needed this for a course.  The professor thinks the book is a joke, as do all of the students."
1311,4,very informative and had plenty of historical facts.<br /><br />good for anyone interested in the origin of the Bourbon industry in the USA

1315,5,"Bought this for my son for his 3rd birthday, he loves it. It's a great book to read especially before bed time."
1316,5,I found the book easy to read with lots of interesting facts and history. I would recommend everyone who lives in the area to give it a read.
1317,5,One of the things that stood out to me about this book is the colors. The pictures just jump out at you. Even if you decide to take this book in a little at a time. The pictures and artwork will keep you coming back for more.<br /><br />a few points:<br />The chapters are not hard to read or understand<br />A great book for anyone who is interested in Sociology or Psych<br />The book is 325 pages long but it doesn't feel like it.<br />from the beginning you feel like your on a journey with the author.
1318,4,"This fun, Halloween-themed book shows a classic tale of &#34;we have things in common, even though we look different,&#34;  but with an interesting twist in which young Frankie Stein is initially shunned by the other children in the ghouls-and-goblins school for being a well-groomed blond-haired boy. Over time, however, they see that he has similar interests to them, and is actually fun despite his appearances. A fun twist for kids accustomed to the &#34;appearance isn't everything&#34; messages we hear more often now, but who perhaps hadn't considered the angle of role reversal, in which the traditionally privileged role is the one that starts as disadvantaged."
1319,5,"Awesome book, this is a great author I've read all her books and enjoyed them all. Can't wait for her newest book to be published"
1320,4,"This is a book for everyone who needs to be informed of critical issues in our civilization, not just for presidents but, especially, our politicians."
1321,1,The book was heavily defaced with notes and underlining on almost every page.  The image does not correspond to the book.
1322,4,"With some embarrassment, I must admit that Great Expectations is the first book by Charles Dickens that I have read. I enjoyed it very much. As a lover of history, this type of story is very compelling to me. This is the story of a very poor and uneducated boy being raised by his harsh sister and her kind husband. The boy known as Pip comes to the attention of some people with power and money, and unexpectedly begins to climb to a higher station in the world, having a number of adventures along the way. The author managed to surprise with a few twists in the plot. Not easily done, as I am an avid reader and connoisseur of stories. I recommend this book very much, and look forward to reading others of his classic works.<br />Michael Travis Jasper, Author of the Novel “To Be Chosen”"
1323,4,"This is such a sweetly written book that seems to hit several of the major aspects of expecting a new little brother or sister. The text is pretty open-ended, allowing for plenty of personal touches for discussing each picture/page with my daughter. My daughter is 20 months old, and although she doesn't understand or grasp the whole concept of getting a new little sibling, she loves this book and gets so excited about hugging or kissing my belly every time we read it. I also love that she included pages dedicated to doctor visits, as this has really helped my daughter lessen any anxiety she has while at my doctor appointments...instead, she's excited to go. I also love how the book addresses the parents leaving for the hospital and the child staying with a caretaker. I know nothing will completely help us prepare our daughter for this, but this allows us an extra opportunity to talk very positively about that specific scenario."
1324,5,I found this book absolutely spell-binding. I wasn't able to put it down.It  I am looking forward to more from this author.
1325,4,I learned the word and mean relate to pic Bible to make understand better<br />I think I would put 4 stars.
1326,4,"This is a small booklet full of coupons for various different things like &#34;choose what we have for dinner&#34;, &#34;stay up an extra 15 minutes&#34;.  It is perfect for &#34;something different&#34; in the stocking.  The coupons are from Santa to use throughout the year and are intended to be redeemed for good behavior.  This would be best for ages 5-7, and would would work best for kids that can read."
1327,5,"This book kept me on the edge of my seat from the first chapter. You feel like you really know the characters as you read about them, such as the main character, detective Scarsdale. I also have a daugher the same age as the one who was murdered, so this book really hit home for me. I was on the edge of my seat and couldn't put it down until I read the last word. I highly recommend this awesome crime novel."
1328,5,"We rarely like the same novel.  But after each of us picked-up Pointer's War, neither could put it down.  We got into the characters, enjoyed the context  and the historical back-drop.  The final scenes are worth the wait.  Ken Follett, make way for Rob Whittle!"
1329,5,"Great introductory guide to Bonsai for beginners, filled with informative photos and diagrams, covering styles, tools and growing techniques. I highly recommend this handbook."
1330,5,"Lives of Tao is a very enjoyable read that appeals to two themes that I enjoy.  Near-immortal aliens that have been guiding/manipulating humanity since it was a group of smart rats, offering a new spin on history, and the shiftless unfulfilled young man that we either know/knew or are willing to admit are/were finding purpose and ability in the new world he enters.  Some make history.  Others have history thrust upon them.  I look forward to the second book."
1331,5,"In short, an extremely interesting read that you should share with your friends, and then have a great fireside chat about.  Is this our future?  I tend to think so...get on the train!"
1332,5,"Perfect gift for the person that has everything.  Very entertaining for the Miss Kay, of Duck Dynasty, fan.  Very interesting recipes."
1333,5,"Make the Impossible Possible, is Bill Strickland’s self-reflection of his social entrepreneurial mentality, and how through passion and a few ‘peak experiences’ he was able to defy the odds and achieve true success through developing his personal identity. Strickland’s main message is to help the average person realize what their personal definition of accomplishment is, and to make success the product of acting on ones passions and dreams. Strickland shows that success is only as good as the people whom you share it with. I greatly enjoyed this book, and feel that it is a must read for any aspiring entrepreneurs."
1334,5,I loved it. And I can't wait for my grandchildren to grow up reading this book. It will keep their interest.
1335,5,"If you are into the Law of Attraction, you will love this book!  It is a great how-to guide of attracting wealth and abundance into your life.  Very practical ideas you can easily and happily incorporate into your everyday life."
1336,5,Very convicting. The stories in this book is what grace looks like if we were to give God's grace to others. The book is beautifully written. This is the first book I read by Tullian and I enjoyed it a lot! He is a very good writer and has great stories about God's grace.
1337,3,This isn't a stand alone book like I though it would be.  You still need to read his first book then read this on top of that one.
1338,5,"A very good bible.  great for learning, whether you are just beginning or have been in church for years, easy to read, and follow."
1339,5,"I've owned a business for 8 years, and always just &#34;getting by&#34;.  I've always been intimidated by books about business because they are usually very complicated.  The title should really be HOW TO DOUBLE YOUR PROFITS FOR DUMMIES.  I mean, the strategies and concepts are so simple, yet very EFFECTIVE!  I find myself reading a chapter, putting the book down, and implementing all the stuff from that chapter in less than one week into my business.  I'm considering giving this book as a gift to each of my clients because it is that fundamentally groundbreaking for entrepreneurs.  Thank you Brian for pouring your heart (and experiences) out to entrepreneurs.  We need it."
1340,5,Read this book a long time ago and was happy to see i could get a copy after all this time!
1341,5,It's sad to see many criticisms from people who probably never wrote a book.<br />Satan can use many tricks to keep us from growing and we must be aware of that. I found it to be very helpful in allowing the Holy Spirit to convict me in what areas I needed to work on and the book does an excellent job in explaining each area. It's so easy to lose focus on our walk and need studies like this to get us back on track.
1342,5,It is clear and  you don't have to be a third year English major to comprehend.  If you follow the guide lines it takes you right to the species you are trying it recognize.
1343,5,This is a great book to help teach to young girls that they don't need to follow the classic cliché and always have a boy rescue them. It also shows that it is okay for pretty young girls to be smart and independent. The princess in the book doesn't know that she doesn't need a prince to survive. This book also helps teach this lesson to young girls. I highly recommend this book.
1344,5,"We used this book in homeschool kindergarten when my daughter was learning to count to 100. The thing that's nice and different about this book is that the dot-to-dot pictures are actually illustrations in the book length story. Now admittedly the story being told isn't great literature. But it's certainly entertaining enough and kept my little one interested to see what was going to happen next. I had her connect the dots, then we'd read the story for that day, then she would color in the picture. Very enjoyable and a good choice for little ones learning to count and working on fine motor skills."
1345,5,"The problem with the autobiography format, for the reader, is that we are too often looking for a complete record of a person's life. If that is what you are expecting you should stick to straight biographies. What I got from this book, and what I get from all autobiographies, is insight into the perceptions of the author.<br />I have waited more than forty years to read a book by Earl \\""The Pearl\\"" Monroe, (like I am still waiting for the next New York Knicks championship. I know....I'll be waiting quite a while longer for that, to say the least.) I was an avid fan of the Knicks before their first championship in 1969-1970, and after the cheering died down for that accomplishment, and the one to follow in 1972-1973, it has been mostly downhill from there; (with a few high points).<br />But what I remember most from those early years, (my early years), was the rivalry between the Knicks and the Baltimore Bullets, (and the Lakers and the Celtics). The match-up between The Pearl and Walt \\""Clyde\\"" Frazier is one for the ages. And when Monroe wound up on the Knicks in the early 1970s it was like a dream come true.<br />I then got to watch poetry-in-motion on a regular basis. The whirling dervish, double-and-triple pumping machine that was Earl \\""The Pearl\\"" Monroe knocked me on my butt nearly every game. I often wonder when I watch the current crop of New York Knicks why they don't confer with the historic film footage to try and learn how to fake, (and drive fearlessly to the basket without eating the ball when their telegraphed moves are anticipated by the opposing defense). And if they don't have the ambition to do that they could at least tap the brain of Mr. Frazier, who is always present.<br />Mr. Monroe refers to himself as an improviser. I couldn't put it better myself. His arrival almost paralleled, in a way, the emergence of Louis Armstrong in the Paul Whiteman era. There just wasn't any way the music could ever return to a simpler state. Once the \\""damage\\"" is doneprogress must go on. And we can see that progress, (again, looking at the historic footage; if you weren't privileged to view it first-hand), of the big stars that followed. The players who made their mark, (fill in your favorites here), must have all witnessed Mr. Monroe, at least on film.<br />You see, they just don't make them like Earl Monroe anymore. And no matter how bad things get in New York, I will always have those memories to fall back on. Is it any wonder that the Knicks organization, on a regular basis, provides the fan base with awards ceremonies; (number retirements, anniversaries of championships, etc.?) While accomplishing the right thing, (the honoring of our heroes), they are also trying to drop a hint. (Are you reading this Carmelo Anthony?)"
1346,5,"Dan and Tina, Linda and Mike, Victoria and Max. Three couples who haven't really kept in touch in all those years since school meet up at Dan and Tina's wedding and it's a catalyst for all of them. Different people, different lives and yet all are searching for happiness in their own way. For Dan, it's all about investing his inheritance - making a new life for himself and his new wife. But Tina has secrets of her own and when she won't confide in her husband, he turns to other arms for comfort. Victoria's husband is the jealous type and if he can't have his wife, the he's out to make sure nobody can. And meanwhile Linda's wondering just where she's gone wrong as she watches her friends moving on without her.<br /><br />The author dips in and out of each of their lives, showing us slices of reality - what makes them tick. Women readers will all be looking out for the gorgeously hunky, newly-rich and sexy Daniel. Male readers will probably be longing for uptight Victoria... But each of the characters has their faults and their virtues and that's what makes them real people with real lives. This isn't chick lit and it isn't literary fiction. Something in between? Does it even matter?<br /><br />Addictive stuff. My work didn't get done because I was too busy reading this!"
1347,3,"I have a vast collection of great parenting books and was hopeful in reading this.  I thoroughly enjoyed Larry's &#34;It's Called Work for a Reason&#34; but not this book so much.<br /><br />I was especially disappointed at his premise that some tweens/teens will have premarital sex and engage in other risky behaviors - so you might as well buckle in for a bumpy ride.  I know, from working with many teens, that these behaviors are very avoidable and that parents make a HUGE impact in visiting with their children and helping them make wise choices."
1348,4,"Proof of heaven and the afterlife is sought by most everyone in anticipation of its experience.  The book's title draws us to it in hopes of finding  the answer.  While real proof from the book can be questioned, it describes a somewhat startling and hopeful journey in getting into heaven and eternity."
1349,5,"I read this book several times as a teenager and into my 20s, and loved it, laughing until I wept at many points.  I still have the worn-out paperback somewhere around.  How about converting this one to Kindle format?  Please?"
1350,5,"I have recently decided to become vegan, and when I saw this book, even though I am not a &#34;stoner&#34;, my instant reaction was that if this book is for stoners, the recipes must be crazy simple, easy, and cheap. I am happy to let you know that this is definitely the case! I've just started making some of the recipes and these are so incredibly easy I wonder why I waited to long to become vegan. These dishes are also easy to pair with meat if you just want some interesting ideas for meals that are simple, healthy and easy.<br /><br />Compared to other vegan cookbooks, I really really enjoyed this one. I've always kind of avoided the extremely earthy flavor that you get with most vegan dishes, but these are definitely more about flavor in some dishes and--occasionally--perfectly mimicking flavors in other dishes. :) nomnomnom!<br /><br />The one thing that sucks a little bit (for me personally) is that a lot of the recipes include mushrooms, and I hate mushrooms. Other than that, I highly recommend this book for beginning vegans, stoner vegans, and college vegans that need fast, easy, and cheap meals."
1351,2,"Video's do not work,cannot access videos that are in the book on website, sent email to Golf Magazine but they never responded"
1352,5,"I was in tears as I read how Mr. Kirby was inspired to write this, in part, by what he read on the headstone of William Strong who was murdered in the line of duty in 1899. I am William Strong's great-great granddaughter. I am so thankful for this book which tells not only his story, but those of all the officers who lost their lives as they worked to protect and serve their fellow citizens.<br /><br />I found I had to limit myself to a few stories at a time because they touched me so deeply. Perhaps that's because of my great-great grandfather's story . . . and the fact that I am the mother of a police officer. Very well written and researched. This beautiful tribute helps us understand not only the dangers of this job, but the dedication of those men and women who put their lives on the line for us every single day. I cannot recommend it highly enough. (The memorial built next to the State Capitol in Salt Lake as a result of this book is worth seeing, too.)"
1353,4,I like the book.  The pace seemed to flow really well.  Always hard to get into the the Old Republic books while there isn`t a whole lot for novels published in that corner of the galaxy.  One of the better read for Star Wars.
1354,5,"The text is simple & short enough to hold the attention of a young toddler.  It isn't like &#34;See dog run.&#34;, (that actual book is quite great though!) with boring sentences to read aloud.  They are somewhat complex.  If, on some nights, they are too verbose, it's easy to read just one phrase & still make an entertaining story for the reader!  The drawings are equally perfect in that they are very detailed, lively & fun. It's hard to find a book with this combination of text/graphics. I highly recommend the Harry series, even if the stories get a bit repetitive."
1355,5,"Fun, easy to follow and it works! We love the variety and as a homeschool parent, I love that I can skim the lesson in minutes and understand the targets so clearly."
1356,5,Fascinating and Imaginative!  I really enjoyed how the author kept my and my childrens' imaginations flowing throughout the whole book.  I also enjoyed how the book was laid out in short stories.  It made it easier to read to my children (whom are 1 and 2 1/2).  I loved the whole style of the book so much that I purchased another one as a birthday present for my brother.  I can't wait to read more of the Shockpockets' adventures.
1357,5,"I bought this for my 16 yr old son who wants to learn C++. He loves it. It's easy to understand, and has a short quiz at the end of each chapter that I use to help make sure he has learned the lesson."
1358,4,"I did'nt  read  the  book,  it  was  a  present  to  a friend,  Constancio  Levrero, who  is  very fond  of  music  and  of  Britten.  He  enjoyed  the  book  and  praised it warmly."
1359,5,I love the feel to go back to childhood and this is a great way to do it.<br />I am not a fan of reading books at all but D&D chose your own adventure have always been a prime choice.
1360,4,It was definitely enjoyable and explains some other issues that I have found in having read this out of sequence.
1361,4,"got this for a girlfriend of mine, she said she liked it. she really like this author so idk how helpfull this review will be.."
1362,5,"This is the book for you and your friends who have ever thought of Aspen, vacationed there, lived there or plan to. Written by a lyric poet, Bruce chronicles a vision come true. Focusing on the music festival, the book is necessarily about more than that. It is also about the beginnings of the small town that for a brief time no more than a blink of the eye in the long history of dreams for an 'ideal community' a one-class town existed for all practical appearances, a place where people came to 'chill-out' or 'drop out' in the 50s,'60s and '70s, guaranteed membership in an elite environment by simply 'being there.'"
1363,5,"It was entertaining and delightful. We bought them for each of our 10 year old great-grandchildren, but read them ourselves so that we would know what we were giving them. A great gift for the young and old."
1364,5,"This haas always been my favorite translation of &#34;The Gita&#34;.  I've taught it in universities for years and it is, for me, one of the most inspiring of books."
1365,4,"In this accessible collection, the author's love of music shows in such titles as &#34;Bleak Staccatos&#34; and &#34;Intimations: Pianissimo&#34; and suffuses the poems themselves.<br /><br />&#34;finale begins<br />  the bow, poised to strike, descends&#34;<br />—Ode to the Cello<br /><br />One of my favorite poems is about a dressmaker's form made by the author's mother.<br /><br />&#34;Mother made it, her double, with strips of wet floured paper<br />wrapped around her body, then left to dry and cut off.&#34;<br />—I Ask Mother Where It Went<br /><br />Walter confronts loss of home and loss of family in spare, innovative phrasing.<br /><br />Her poems have shape as well as music. They spread out on the page, looking like notes on sheet music."
1366,5,A great book. My daughter loves it. We are doing homeschool and this has been a GREAT help. Math is now become a favorite subject.
1367,3,"Michael Reynolds is a good author, but this book uses a lot of \\""Americanized\\"" abbreviations and references that drives you crazy after a while. Example: instead of using the correct \\""3. Company, III.(gep.) SS-PzGr Regiment 'Deutschland' was involved in heavy fighting...\\"", he will say something like \\""The third company of the 3rd Armoured SS Panzer Grenadiers were in involved in heavy fighting...\\""<br />He also does not use proper Waffen-SS ranks, instead choosing to represent them in their American equivalents for us \\""American Readers\\"". I get how that might seem like a good idea for the \\""general public\\"", but the types of people who buy SS history books will most likely know the basic Waffen-SS ranks.<br /><br />It makes things extremely uncomfortable and difficult to understand after a while. I keep asking myself \\""Whose '1st SS Panzer Grenadiers' is her referring to? Siebken, Hansen, or Sandig's Kampfgruppe? Apparently, they ALL have their own \\""1st SS Panzer Grenadiers\\"".<br /><br />That said, I really like that Reynolds is unbiased in his writings and gives a fair perspective of both sides.<br />He also pays remarkable attention to detail regarding the events of the battles. But honestly, I just don't care enough about the Battle of the Bulge to want to know if Joachim Peiper had a cigarette at 4:39am on December 18th in La Gleize. I would like to know more about the German psyche, the types of units involved, some personal accounts from the Waffen-SS, etc. (similar to Hubert Meyer's The 12th SS\\"" volumes)<br /><br />Please use proper German abbreviations for German units in your next work!"
1368,1,"it advertises a 48 page book, and i did not get it. my grand son will be heart broken...thanks for ruining Christmas"
1369,5,"Holy crap, this book is great! I've tried several bread recipes and they have all come out perfectly. I can't recommend this book enough."
1370,3,"After watching Star Trek Into Darkness, I decided to read the newest volume of the Star Trek comic, After Darkness by Mike Johnson.  I was hopeful that it would pick up right where the movie left off.  For the most part, it did.<br /><br />The first of two stories finds Spock dealing with a medical condition that affects male Vulcans every seven years.  The condition, which causes the male to go almost feral, is called “Pon Farr” and the only cure is to return to Vulcan.  The problem is that Vulcan no longer exists.  The rest of the story concerns finding a solution to this problem. I didn’t really find this arc very compelling, and I’m not really sure why.  Maybe it was because Spock, as a main character, is never really in any permanent danger of suffering lasting harm.<br /><br />The second story arc has the Enterprise looking into an attack on a mining outpost by the Gorn.  However, who is to blame for the attack is not clear, and the Gorn may not really be what they appear to be.  This story, while not having the same impact on the characters as the first one, was much more satisfying.  It reminded me more of the Original Series tv episodes in nature, without attempting any major character changes along the way.<br /><br />Where After Darkness connects with the movie, though, is in small snippets throughout the volume.  Here and there we get glances at the Klingons, as they begin to formulate a plan to make the Federation pay for the havoc John Harrison, Kirk and crew wreaked on the Klingon homeworld.  A mysterious figure in shadows communicating with the Klingons adds to the intrigue.  It feels like the pieces are being put in place for a major storyline in future issues; one that sounds way more exciting than those contained in this volume.<br /><br />After Darkness is for Star Trek fans.  I don’t feel like it is set up to draw in the casual fan of the movies.  However, if the Klingon confrontation happens soon, there may be a larger group of peoplescrambling to see how the conflict began.<br /><br />I received a preview copy of this book from IDW Publishing in exchange for an honest review."
1371,4,"The Wicked Wallflower is the first in an intriguing-sounding new series that mixes historical and contemporary romance. It will consists of three historical romance novels that are &#34;written&#34; by the protagonist of a set of contemporary novellas. The &#34;author&#34; bases her novels on her own love life and the short stories show where the inspiration came from.<br /><br />I have been reading Maya Rodale ever since her debut novel, The Heir and the Spare, and have enjoyed all of them. So I was definitely excited to try her new series especially when I learned about the different approach she is taking with these books.<br /><br />What I Liked<br /><br />---I love a good wallflower/rake romance which is one of the reasons I was drawn to this book. The meeting of opposites (in society's mind) is always intriguing. Emma and Blake are an example of a couple that shouldn't work, but they ended up being perfect for one another.<br /><br />---The hero, Blake, stole the book for me! I love it when rakes get their comeuppance and he took his feelings for Emma in stride. I thought his obsession with his Difference Engine and his past made him more than just a pretty face. Plus it was awesome that he was the first one to reveal his feelings!<br /><br />---Female friendships are another thing that I love to see in books and the one between Emma, Olivia, and Prudence was well-written. The scene where the girls drink too much sherry and write the infamous letter sounds like hang-out sessions that I did with my best friends. I'm interested to see how their friendship develops as more of them get married.<br /><br />---The Fortune Games was such an entertaining concept! I am a reality show fan so I appreciated the finer details that Rodale threw in there like the bizarre points tallying to the abrupt evictions. It was just a nice way to force Emma and Blake to spend time with each other after announcing their &#34;engagement&#34; away from the distractions of London.<br /><br />---Aunt Agatha was my second favorite character because she is what I want to be when I get to be her age: confident in my self and not afraid to say what I want when I want to. Her relationship with Blake was especially touching.<br /><br />What I Didn't Like<br /><br />---I am just not a fan of love triangles in any genre. Even though with this being a historical romance, the reader knows who will get the girl in the end and I just found myself being annoyed with that whole plot point. I wish more time had been spent on the obvious couple getting to know more about one another than dealing with the &#34;who will she choose&#34; question.<br /><br />---In connection with the above point, I really started to get annoyed with Emma towards the end. I know she had convinced herself that she was in love with Benedict, but I wanted to smack her in the head when she kept going back and forth between the two men. I wanted her to just make a decision and stick with it. I actually started feeling bad for Benedict because of the way she was stringing him along.<br /><br />My Conclusion<br /><br />I thought this was an adorable love story between two likable people. It is light-hearted (for the most part) and I appreciate the skill involved in writing something like that. Definitely got what I expected with this one and am looking forward to reading more of the series.r />---Aunt Agatha was my second favorite character because she is what I want to be when I get to be her age: confident in my self and not afraid to say what I want when I want to.

1372,5,"LOVED Ball Baby!  June Marie Saxton always has the strongest characters in her books, and this one was no exception.  I loved the tie-ins to her other books, the familiar landmarks, the melted chocolate feelings it conjured up, the morals that were a constant underlying but not preachy storyline, and much, much more.  Well done!"
1373,5,"This one was hard to put down, although perhaps not something someone who gets terribly upset when learning of sexual abuse should read."
1374,5,You only need one book for juicing and this is a very good one.  There are a few tricks not to make juice too bitter or too sweet.<br />You are what you eat and this guide helps.
1375,5,"I had started to read a library copy but found so much detail I wanted to have my own copy.<br />Covers a lot of things---including links to other areas that might not seem apparent-and in detail, that I had never seen.<br />Delivery was prompt and book in perfect condition."
1376,5,It tells th truth about so many of the things that are wrong about America.<br /><br />Dr. Carson is a gifted and a learned man. We need more individuals who are dedicated to true morral principles and will stand up and tell us the truth.<br /><br />Ben Puterbaugh
1377,5,good information I didn't know but should have test and information that will come in handy. I was blow away by some parts of the book it is a work book so you do most of the work. shipping was pretty fast
1378,5,"Beautiful book.  I just loved it and gave it to my niece, 33, who got diabetes at age 1 1/2.  Her husband is also a juvenile diabetic and they just had their first child.  The child has a 50% chance of also having this disease but they will not know for some time.  Beautifully written book with gorgeous illustrations.  I also gave this book to my grandchildren, ages 2, 4, and 8.  They all tried to do something to earn the red heart and each got to wear it.  I highly recommend this book."
1379,5,This was a book that I would never have chosen to read...however it was a choice of my book club. The book was far from tedious and boring. It was very readable and incredibly interesting. I couldn't help but compare it with so many typical text books that can make interesting history dull beyond belief. Who would have thought that I would find it a favorite!
1380,4,"This was a gift to a brother who testified that the book is a must to have to understand capitalism in its purest form,"
1381,4,My 4 year old really enjoys this book.  Likes the idea of filling her bucket and others' buckets as well.
1382,5,"The poetry in this book is beautiful, inspiring, and haunting.  It will inspire you to study Livy's and Macaulay's books on Roman history."
1383,5,"I am using a DSL for my dissertation work and bought this book to learn about DSLs. Although the book is a great resource, as a novice in DSLs, I found that it was important to read the book in a piecemeal manner in order to get what I needed."
1384,5,"The book gives you a head start in building Arduino projects, from very simple projects to more and more complex. You also get building blocs for your future projects."
1385,4,One of my favorite authors but this one was really different for him. Irving's writing is always the best and I never quite know what to expect but always enjoy anything he writes.
1386,4,"• Other than all the gratuitous sex, the book brought back a lot of memories of  “wartime” adventures….both at Devens, Saigon and Arlington Station. If you served in the ASA the author captured the disarray of military service and the camaraderie of those who served.  Not necessarily well written, the author is no Samuel Fuller, but never the less a good read.  FYI  I posted this review in code, but Amazon rejected it ???? What do they know."
1387,5,Well written - great guidelines we had all our management read it as a mandatory read and discussion. good book
1388,2,Fast shipping but the information isn't as detailed or fresh as I had hoped. I'm passing it along to a school fundraising group in hopes that they'll find it useful.
1389,5,"Stacey's story of Long Snows Moon was beautifully put, her way of explain and connecting the Native American ways was very enjoyable, she has a way of placing you within the story, planning on reading more of Stacey's works, outstanding"
1390,5,I was infatuated with this trial but the only reason I bought this book was that Ms Velez-Mitchell was donating proceeds to causes for animals. I loved the book and it was surprisingly a quick read. Very well written and I will buy some of her other books. I have the utmost respect for her and she is a wonderful champion for animals everywhere.
1391,5,I really enjoyed Pedro's Hungry Ride. It raises awareness of access to healthy food in a fun and colorful way. There is no better way to shed light on an important issue. Very well written and illustrated. Highly recommended.
1392,3,"I'm a fan of Virgil Flowers and have been from the first time we &#34;met,&#34; but he doesn't seem like himself in this story - especially toward the end. The plot had promise and the mix of characters had potential, but I came away unsatisfied."
1393,5,Absolutely amazing!!!! What a strong young lady... She truly inspires a lot if young women out there. To go through what she went through is horrible. Thank you for sharing you story and am so thankful you r home safe.
1394,4,"Reviews by Robert Kirk(July 31, 2013), Anthony J. Faulkner(March 6, 2013), Kocese(November 27, 2012), and Straddle1985(December 30, 2011)--particularly his comment about the Zweig scoring system, all give a faithful depiction of this book.  This book would serve as a superb foundation if one wants to invest the stock market.  You will be able to interpret what is said by the analysts on CNBC much better after reading it.<br /><br />Chapter 4 is one of my favorites.  It is labeled \\""Don't Fight the Fed\\"" and basically says when the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates, the DJIA and NASDAQ are primed to move upwards. Here's the key quote \\""Generally, a rising trend in rates is bearish for stocks; a falling trend is bullish...falling interest rates reduce the competition on stocks from other investments, especially short-term investments such as Treasury bills, certificates of deposit, money market funds...Obviously the reverse is true when interest rates rise.\\""<br /><br />An excellent guidebook for future reference."
1395,5,Wonderful concise summary of the Psalms with &#34;handles&#34; for organizing their various themes for personal and public use.  Author shares the importance of Psalm use in his personal devotional life.
1396,5,"This story is so well written I turned page after page, holding my breath. It's been a long time since I have enjoyed a book so much. It is wonderful story. It is complicated, but well written, and easy to read. I feel like I'm a fly on the wall, seeing the action in person. I know this is a book I will read again and again. I could not put it down!!!"
1397,5,"The writing and pacing of the story reminds me a lot of Edgar Rice Burrough's writing. As he's one of my favorite authors, that is a huge compliment. Highly recommend this book."
1398,4,"Bought this to read on plane on the way to Spain.  Very simple, my 4 year old enjoyed it and we read it over and over."
1399,4,"This book has been sitting on my TBR pile for quite some time, and I'm happy I finally got around to reading it! I thought this book did a really great job of portraying how a family can be affected by such a tragic act of one person. Merry and Lulu's father killed their mother and attempted to kill Merry. He completely tore their family apart. Not only did the girls no longer have a mother, they didn't have a father, or much of any extended family that were willing to care for them.<br /><br />I identified much more with Lulu than I did Merry, and it was simply because of how she handled her father killing her mother. If that had happened to me, I know I would have likely handled it the same way; I wouldn't want anything to do with my father. However, even though the girls handled this incident in completely different ways, their father still controlled so much of their lives. Merry felt she needed to be a support system for her father because he guilted her into it... it was always: &#34;you're the only one I have... I don't have anyone else...I need you so much...&#34; On the other hand, although Lulu pretended he was dead, he still affected her daily choices. It determined what she told her friends and classmates about her life, what she tells her future family, how she deals with the internal struggle of every day living, etc. Both of these girls were affected in such a terrible way by what their father did. Their mother wasn't the only victim; the children were as well. I think society often forgets about how family members are affected by heinous crimes such as this, and we often think so much about the victim that was physically harmed, whether killed or injured.<br /><br />Now I know why my future mother-in-law read this in just a couple days when we were on a road trip to Florida! It was a very fast paced read and takes you through 30-odd years of Merry and Lulu's lives. I would definitely recommend this book to others (:"
1400,5,"Excellent book for those looking to understand the nature of the therapeutic relationship and alliance, and the elements that are central to effective treatment, regardless of technique or school of treatment."
1401,5,"I love it but I think the book should be better so I will read one declaration everyday, but still the best to listen"
1402,5,"Great resource and interesting the developmental items included are new, and more for resource.  Really interesting and well done. one"
1403,5,"Best book I ever read on the subject.  Was like reading the story of my life!  Gave a copy to my therapist and a copy to her office.  Another therapist read it and is using it in her therapy; said it is the best book she's read on the subject and that it changed the way she's doing therapy for sexual abuse survivors.  This book is for therapists, and sexual abuse survivors.  I believe ALL therapists and/or doctors who are working with sexual abuse victims (childhood sexual abuse) should read this in order to help the victims better.  To the victims: please buy this book.  You will be greatly helped by it and it will make your life fit together like a puzzle.  Know you are not alone."
1404,3,"This book is well written for those battling with their children's behavior. I do agree with some of the techniques, but others I disagree with. It takes more that one child and/or book to get the hang of handling a toddler. They are all different and this book takes that into account with this &#34;New Way&#34; to stop battling with your toddler."
1405,4,"This book by Terri Austin was a pleasant read for me. The characters were well developed and you got to know them and believe in them. The plot was one to keep your interest. Have not read any of the others in the series but would be interested in finding them.<br /><br />J. Robert Ewbank author \\""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the Isms\\"" and \\""Wesley's Wars\\"""
1406,4,"Thus far i really enjoy the series, Merit is a character most women can enjoy, humorous, loves food, kicks butts and gets the guy. The overall story arch through the series seems good, lots of twists, heart ache and humor. My only issue is that i at times feel like it gets bogged down in the details and things should be moving a bit faster. Could it be better, sure anything can, but honestly i'll keep buying the books, and i only buy books i'll reread over time."
1407,5,"I found this book very informative on all phases of the events leading to, during and follwing the Civil War. It is also number 34 on liat of 50 must read books on the Civil War."
1408,5,"\\""Outrageous Conduct\\"" is a well-written expose of what happened on the set of \\""The Twilight Zone\\"" in 1982. Amazing that people didn't go to jail. A cautionary tale about Hollywood and hubris. Highly recommended."
1409,3,"This is a good book if you are already using signing, but if you a beginner don't order this one yet."
1410,5,"This is an outstanding novel in which the author describes how a country lost its freedom and spiraled downward into chaos, tyranny, poverty, and barbarism. That country was the United States of America. Although the characters are allegorical, the author utilizes history as well as a profound understanding of strategy and tactics to frame the narrative. The triumph of the human spirit over seemingly insurmountable obstacles and odds as the ultimate theme of the book adds to its timeless quality. This is a must-read for anyone interested in understanding past and present challenges to human freedom and the threat of tyranny that transcends time and place."
1411,5,"This is a book I urge everyone to have on their shelves.  My copy of this book is from 1979. I use it consistantly because the information is always current. This is a lifestyle choice, not a \\""survival\\"" or \\""prepper\\"" outlook.<br /><br />Knowing where & what type of problems can occur you can take the necessary actions to be in charge of your life.<br /><br />When you have what you must have, you won't panic if something happens.<br /><br />While I'm not positive that a nuclear war will break out, there are (as we have seen in Japan) possible negative results from nuclear reactor wreckage.  This manual shows where this might occur & the paths they may take.<br /><br />Famine, earthquake, uncertain economics, any or all of these may happen.  If you have everything put by for these occurances, you have peace in your soul.<br /><br />I can assure that this is one of the few books that I never loan."
1412,5,"Totally different story and plot line from the Virginia wine series by Ellen Crosby.  Excellent read about adversaries, arts, and world wide search for oil and gas.  Crosby's very first novel written years ago was about Russia, and this was similar, but updated in a neat way.  Think she is a truly good writer."
1413,5,"John Calvin's wink on the front cover is enough to indicate what sort of book this is. Both a reference work and a playful instructional book, this is excellent for Sunday school teachers, youth leaders, and even church leaders who can forget basic knowledge sometimes taken for granted from the pulpit or in conversation.<br />Reads like a \\""Worst Case Scenario Survival Guide\\"" but with regular activities at church and common practices of faith. Under the playful heading, \\""Church Stuff,\\"" there are sections on \\""How to Pass the Offering Plate,\\"" \\""How to Sing a Hymn,\\"" \\""How to Sing a Praise Song,\\"" \\""How to Survive for One Hour in an Un-Air-Conditioned Church,\\"" and such. Under the \\""Everyday Stuff,\\"" we have \\""How to Pray,\\"" \\""How to Forgive Someone,\\"" \\""How to Identify a Genuine Miracle,\\"" \\""How to Resist Temptation,\\"" \\""How to be Saved (by Grace Through Faith and Not by Good Works)\\"" and so forth.<br />Charts and lists also make large topics less intimidating: \\""Common Translations of the Bible,\\"" \\""Top Ten Bible Villains,\\"" \\""Five Grossest Bible Stories,\\"" \\""Five Facts about Life in Old Testament times,\\"" etc.<br />\\""How to Avoid Getting Burned at the Stake\\"" is humorous today but also instructive on what life as a Protestant was like at the beginning. Other historical items include key parts of the Heidelberg Catechism, \\""John Calvin's Key Thoughts on Spiritual Living,\\"" and \\""Important Things the Reformers Wrote and Why They're Still Important Today.\\""<br />The charts comparing world religions and Christian denominations, seasons of the church year and a family tree of Christian groups are all instructive as well as helpful.<br />Easy to read, designed for flip through scanning, and enjoyable way of learning."
1414,3,"It is very insightful. Not for everyone. Especially conservative Christians who are not open to new people, new ideas,new way of loving and serving.  But shows truth about need in our world, and someone who is answering the call in spite of being different.<br />I recommend it to anyone who wants to go deeper into spiritual living."
1415,5,"Four college buddies, now about 50, on a golfing vacation/reunion to the \\""paradise\\"" of Hawaii get caught up in a serious discussion about an \\""eternal paradise\\"".  Does it exist?  Full of many interesting facts about scripture, evolution vs creationism, and more.  One to keep as a reference and also to share."
1416,5,Love this Bible. Great study tool. I highly recommend this if you are looking to just study the Word of God without others opinions.
1417,5,Received my text within 2days!! Great text!! Practically brand new! Recommend to rent the textbook if you don't need it in your health profession or science library.
1418,5,"As a native NY'er and someone who is very interested in the history of NYC, I highly recommend this book to anyone who shares that interest. Anbinder presents the history of the Five Points in an interesting, sometimes humorous, sometimes sad, but always interesting way that makes this book hard to put down. Its well researched and far from a dry presentation of facts.  A great book for anyone interested in this topic."
1419,5,"This book is amazing!!! The author,  John Blackburn, showcases his amazing talent of architectural Designs of stables! The work shows his ability to think outside the box and design not only functional but beautiful stables, that I would love to live in myself. You will enjoy every photo and the description transports you to interior of these Amazing stables!!!  Buy the book, you will love every page!!"
1420,4,"Keeps your interest, easy storyline. I enjoyed the book. Actually I would give it another 1/2 star, but couldn't manage it on the screen. 4.5 stars!"
1421,5,"In depth analysis and easy to read.<br />one, two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen"
1422,5,The verses were very well explained by an expert. Derek Lin points out some of the poorly translated verses and sets the reader straight on the exact meaning of the particular verse. It's well organized. There's no other book like this on the market!
1423,5,"I hate the idea of missing out on the best content because I can't find the necessary pieces. With this strategy guide, it makes all the difference between my game sitting on the shelf and completing it. Really they made no extras, just hard to find necessities to get that sweet Abyssal Armor. With this guide it's a matter of looking in the right places and using the right tools."
1424,5,"I purchased this one for a friend, who started to read my copy and needed her own copy. I originally purchased and read this book, and worked through some of the exercises for a graduate course I took in Philosophy as it relates to education. However, this book is not just for teachers/educators bringing philosophy to the classroom. It's for everyday people. The book has 10 chapters (1. Simplicity, 2. Communications, 3. Perspective, 4. Flexibility, 5. Empahty, 6. Individuality, 7. Belonging, 8. Serenity, 9. Possibility, 10. Joy). Each chapter discusses different philosophers, such as Socrates, Plato, the Dalai Lama, Martin Luther King, Jr., Sartre, Jane Adams, Mary Wllstonecraft, and many more). Each chapter starts with the chapter topic, followed by the philosophers for that chapter, and then homework/exercises for the reader to practice. At the end of the chapter the resources are listed, such as music, poems, documentaries, etc. This gives the reader the opportunity to explore beyond the book. Can't say enough good things about this book. If you are interested in finding meaning in your life this book is worth reading. Other suggested reading: Socrates Cafe by Christopher R. Phillips"
1425,5,"This was in good quality, and the code worked without a hitch. Despite being marked as used but like new, it looked completely brand new and was unopened."
1426,5,"I'm always scared to read the next book in this series because I can't imagine any new couple being as compelling and full of chemistry as the last, but Dianne Duvall makes me eat my words while drawing me in for more.<br /><br />Krysta instantly draws your attention as she acts her way into a confrontation with some vamps she is eager to cut to pieces. All the woman in the Immortal Guardians series are kick-ass so you know that Krysta could be no different but she takes it a bit farther by being a vampire hunter on her own and being able to stay alive as long as she has. With Krysta we also meet her brother who happens to have the gift as a healer and takes care of her when she comes home from hunting for the night. When Etienne shows up saving her from a vampire situation that gets a little hairy she has no idea what to think, she knows he is vampire but he doesn't act like the other vampires and his aura color is all wrong.<br /><br />We know a bit about Etienne from the past books but we get to know him better in DARKNESS RISES. He notices Krysta and can not get her off his mind. He follows her and protects her when she finds herself biting of more than she can chew. They both fall hard and fast for each other and develop as a couple as swiftly as the others. Besides following the newest couple we learn a bit more about the other immortals. The coolest information is that we get a glimpse of what makes Seth and David who they are!<br /><br />I absolutely love that all the characters are involved in each installment in the series. We get to meet the new couple, watch them develop, and still watch the others develop even more than they already have. They all come together to make each chapter full of action, entertainment, and engaging plot. The overall story that ties each book together continues to develop and twist as the Immortal Guardians stories continue. You do not want to miss this series and you wont want to put it down once you start. Pick up the first book if it's new to you and don't hesitate adding DARKNESS RISES to your book collection if you have not already!ook if it's new to you and don't hesitate adding DARKNESS RISES to your book collection if you have not already!"
1427,4,"Sci fi , horror and high seas adventure in this &#34;Polity Universe&#34; tale. 1st in a series of Spatterjay novels."
1428,5,Mo Willems continues to delight children of all ages with this humorous twist on what one would expect this tale to be. Even the cover grabs your interest!  All of his books make excellent gifts from grandparents to grandchildren.
1429,5,It  was for my son's school project.  it answered a lot of questions he had.  The book helped him to understand  the  holocaust.
1430,4,"I very much enjoyed how the author weaved both myths and sourcery into this trilogy!-the Black Unicorn, Gold Unicorn, and Red Unicorn.  I have yet to read anything else by this author(as she is hard to find without going online, and for some strange reason, I either misplaced or accidently got rid of this set:(.  so far, I have only been able to replace this book and it's kinda hard to re-read without the other two book since it's the 2nd book, but I will find anything that has to do with unicorns!"
1431,4,"Really.  In 1969 I was 19 years old and visiting in Hawthorne California from Detroit, where I grew up.  The place I was staying didn't have a TV, but there was this book from the library there &#34;Stay Young and Vital,&#34; by Bob Cummings.  I always liked his TV show, &#34;The Bob Cummings Show&#34; (In reruns they call it &#34;Love That Bob&#34;) so I picked it up and started to read.  Up to this point in life I had really never given a single thought to nutrition or health, or, more to the point, MORTALITY, and my quality of life in between birth and death.<br /><br />Again, really; Reading this little puffy book by a Hollywood celebrity made me realize for the first time that how I ate and exercised and lived could make a big difference in my HAPPINESS in life.  I know it sounds like I was a rather doltish 19 year-old, but believe me, in the Detroit culture of the 50's and 60's the only nutritional advice I ever heard was &#34;Eat your bread crusts (on my p & j sandwich) and maybe you'll have curly hair like your Uncle Joe.&#34;  It was a different time, folks.<br />So, as I say, this book started me thinking...I started thinking &#34;In a few years I'll be 40.  I wanna still be able to run.&#34;  Thinking about what kind of shape all the 40 year olds were in that I'd seen all my life frankly-- scared me.  As Mose Allison said, &#34;This ain't me.&#34;<br />Now I'm 63, I've still got a 29&#34; waist, and I'm actually in much better shape than I was back in 1969.  Really.  So I wasn't kidding when I said this book changed my life.<br /><br />So I was thinking about how influential this tome had been for me and thought &#34;I'll bet it's on Amazon.  I should own that book!&#34;  It arrived really quick, it's a hard cover 1st edition (not sure there was a second;) and--get this--it still had the original DUST COVER from 1960.  Re-reading it I must say it holds up rather well.  His advice is pretty much right on, in a down-the-middle sort of way.  No extreme stuff--vegan, macrobiotic, or that sort of thing.  He disses vegetarians, though once one himself, but I guess that part of the book didn't take for me--I quit eating meat about 40 years ago (pescatarian, if you will).<br /><br />In a few ways this book is a little bit dated perhaps(it was written by an actor and published in 1960, what would you expect?) and I personally could do without a lot of the &#34;old-time religion&#34; that is nonetheless part and parcel for Cummings world view (his mother was a minister in the Church of Religious Science) but I must say in many MORE ways it's unexpectedly prescient.  Some information he imparts regarding mild (pre-pellagra) niacin deficiency symptoms made me wonder if some of the record number of people being diagnosed today as bi-polar may actually just need a little B vitamin in their regular diet.<br /><br />The recommendations he makes are all pretty sound.  If this had been the only book I EVER read regarding health/nutrition (and, believe me, back in my salad days I read plenty [sorry about the pun]) I could not have gone too far wrong.  And oh, by the way, it's an interesting read because Charles Clarence Robert Orville Cummings was an interesting guy whose godfather, Orville Wright, taught him to fly, a lifelong avocation for him.  He doesn't mention it in his book, but I happen to know he was actually the first certified flight instructor in the United States, certificate # 1.  But he does mention (and uses it as a parable about &#34;knowing thyself&#34;) that during the depression, to get work in NY as an actor he posed for years as an Englishman named Blade Stanhope Conroy, and later as a Texan (found out by King Vidor who asked him which one was the real persona and he was forced to say, &#34;Neither.&#34;)<br />So it's interesting, informative, well-edited and proofed, and, speaking for myself, a damned IMPORTANT book."
1432,5,"Book was great, although not quite like TV series, it was actually better.<br />Once I started reading couldn't put it down."
1433,5,What a great book> The story is captivating! Had to sit and read it in a few quick sittings. Can't wait for the next installment from Harry Franklin.
1434,5,"These books are terrific! They are a great way for kids to use math and also think abstractly. It has them look for relationships in a math problem. My daughter found it fun, well as much as a 9 year old can find extra work fun! She would have to think for a while and anylse the problem. These books are especially helpful if you have a child going into an advanced or gifted program. These are the types of questions and material they may have and it is very helpful if at least they are familiar with this."
1435,5,"I had a hard time getting into this story,  It starts out slow but the author is very good at building her characters so that you end up feeling like they are part of your family.  I hurt when they hurt and I am happy when they are.  Her stories are all believable because they are based on facts and the locations are familiar to us.  I love her books.  I have the other two and can't wait to continue as all of her books are linked to others... I am addicted!"
1436,5,"We discover, early on,, that life doesn't always reward virtue or punish vice. As far back as the Bible, people have wanted to know why the wicked often prosper while the good frequently suffer. In response, we're told to cultivate the serenity to accept what we can't change while we try to find the courage to change the things, including ourselves, that we hopefully can change.<br /><br />It's the search for the \\""the wisdom that knows the difference\\"" that can prompt us to take our first steps on a consciously spiritual path and to seek out a mentor, guide or teacher whose counsel is often some variation of the \\""four noble truths:\\"" to strive, in our daily lives, to offer compassion, bestow kindness, show humility, express gratitude.<br /><br />Good advice, but how are we to do that in the face of the trials and setbacks we meet as soon as we try to put those ideals into practice? Easy to have compassion for and be kind to those whom we favor; harder to be kind and compassionate to those who've abused us,  betrayed us, wronged us, done us and our loved ones harm. When pride, envy, anger, bitterness, resentment and a host of related feelings and attitudes come knocking, as sooner or later they're bound to, how are we, in the face of the resignation and cynicism triggered by those feelings and attitudes, to open the door of our grievances with humility when what we really want to do is to fire a canon out the window of retribution at those who've mocked, mistreated, taken advantage of and belittled us? When worry, anxiety, fear and misfortune beset us, how are we to be grateful? Grateful for what: rejection, isolation, illness, unhappiness, the thousand ways the world has of putting us down with arrogance and contempt, assuring us that we're not good enough and never will be? And how are we to give to others the love, trust, warmth and understanding that, unjustly, was never given to us? If the mentor, teacher or guide can't point us step by step - follow these instructions in the manual of life and things are guaranteed to get better - we may feel: what good is he or she?<br /><br />The writer of these brief reflections, one of the leaders of the nationally known Open The Heart Workshops, in the course of his thirty-plus years of reaching out to souls in need of hope and healing, has faced these questions in the only way he - and we - truly can: by experiencing these trials and setbacks and by finding, in the experience, the inner strength and forbearance to be a caring companion to others who've experienced similar trials and setbacks and then, with tenderness, to bear witness, by example, to the truth of the Biblical promise that though weeping may last the night, joy, if we let it, can come in the morning.<br /><br />In answer to the question: how are we to give others what was never given to us, read Carolyn's story (\\""The Greatest Gift In The World\\""). Can we forgive the unforgiveable; and, if so, how? Have a look at \\""An Oriole Versus a Yankee.\\"" Are we alone on our solitary path leading to we're not sure where? The insights shared in \\""Enfolding The Orphan Child,\\"" \\""A Walk In The Woods\\"" and \\""My Old Friend\\"" suggest that we aren't. As for those rare moments of grace when the world falls away and, for the shadow of an instant, another world appears, a world that we somehow know, though we may not know how we know, except that this other world seems to be our source of hope and strength, a world described by poets, artists, mystics and spiritual teachers: as for these unbidden moments of grace that seem to come out of nowhere and vanish just as quickly, the writer renders some of these magic moments with exquisite sensitivity and, in so doing, helps us to keep to our path in the face of the doubts and uncertainties that tempt us to abandon it.<br /><br />These delicate pieces distill a lifetime's wisdom that comes from hard, steady practice, grinding it out in the spiritual trenches, day by day, holding oneself accountable even when no one's looking. The writer plants a roof garden, visible out the window of his office, and adorns it with gem-like stones and pretty flowers, hoping that the birds might come and find a welcome. Instead the squirrels arrive and tear the place apart. The writer is furious. The garden is meant to be a haven for birds, not a trash heap for squirrels. He's about to take up arms and teach these raucous intruders a thing or two when - surprise! - it's the squirrels who've come, as flash mentors and stealth guides, to teach the writer a thing or two. And the question for him - for us - is ever: are we willing and able to learn what those who wreck havoc in the gardens of our lives have to teach? I would like to be willing and able, and I suspect that these meditations will help me to be more teachable than I might be if I hadn't read them.<br /><br />When the writer's first grandchild was born, the writer's daughter asks, \\""What do you want her to call you?\\"" The writer, a lifelong Boston Red Sox fan, tells his daughter to have his granddaughter call him \\""Yastrzemski\\"" (after Carl Yastrzemski, the former Red Sox great). Nah, she says, too many syllables. So they settle on \\""Grumpy.\\"" I figure that any spiritual master who tells his daughter to have his granddaughter call him \\""Grumpy\\"" is apt to know, on the sly, where, under the earthly mat, the key to heaven lies."
1437,5,"This book is nice be ause they give you everything you need to get up and go. Tells you how to get there, how far and the conditions.  Very useful guide"
1438,5,"Steve Ogden's Headstones and Monuments quickly blurs the lines between what the author experienced as a child, what he perceives as having previously experienced, and rich, twisting fiction.  Reading a little like the progression of short stories by Poe, each story is complete by itself, but all of them together make up a shiver-inducing collection perfect for reading by candlelight.  I had to turn the lights on once or twice, and I've definitely double-checked my mirror ever since!  Great for fans of Neil Gaiman and the short stories of Stephen King as well."
1439,5,It was a new book. Thank you so much!<br />Have a wonderful day :) hhh jjjj llll oooo s l
1440,5,"I've had a mom's calendar before and really wanted another one.  I was disappointed when I couldn't find a 2013 one in stock.  Then I found this one that started in August 2013 and goes through all of 2014.  Purchased it late July, early August, but it took a few weeks to fill order.  When it showed up, the cover was torn through at the staples.  You can't hang it if the cover is torn off, so I requested a replacement.  The replacement showed up within a few days and I started using the new one in September.  The size makes it easy for me to list everything I need to (time, address, etc).  Plus I'm the type of person that decorates special dates,such as birthdays, so it's nice to have it displayed on the fridge.  The pocket makes it easy to store a marker to write with, plus papers like invitations.  I highly recommend it if you have the space for it."
1441,4,Good ideas except for projects requiring visualization. Members in group can't conjure up images from imagination. Must be given direct examples of each project and most need help executing them.
1442,5,It was exactly what I was looking for. My kids love it and it reached me in good status . I'd like to buy more of items like this one. Thanks Amazon.
1443,5,Love this book!  I've had it for years and have slowly worked my way through it whenever the mood strikes me.  There are a huge range of puzzles from easy to nail bitingly frustrating.  There are 2 puzzles per page so you get a lot of room to work.
1444,3,There is essentially no section on abdominal reconstruction... no wonder 90% general surgeons really don't know how to do modern open repairs of complex ventral hernias.
1445,5,"Lets be honest, your a dad with a newborn baby. At this point your are barely able to get dressed & feed yourself. You don't exactly have the attention span to be reading novels about how to take care of an infant.<br /><br />This book offers chapters that are short & sweet, but also humorous... to the point where you will be having a good laugh every time you read it. Humor aside, the book offers great advice structured so you can get info you need without a major commitment.<br /><br />Every Dad I know who has read this book says it was the best book they got as a new father. I've gifted it to 3 people who have all gifted this book on."
1446,4,This model kit do help during chem exam. But it is hard to assemble and disassemble. It took large space. You may want smaller model kit.
1447,5,"An excellent little booklet. Short and to the point with references and links for further study. The pictures provided also make the booklet all the more interesting. Reasons to Affirm a Young Earth by Paul G. Humber, Editor lists 50 lines of compelling evidence for a young planet Earth! Some of the lines of evidence include carbon-14 found in diamonds, supernovas, human population growth, soft tissues found in dinosaur fossils, the decay rate of Earth's magnetic field, the formation of oil, polystrate and index fossils, the amount of sodium in the sea and much more! If this booklet doesn't get your mind to contemplating the various evidences presented, then I don't know what would. I recommend this booklet to all who are interested in the subject of the evolution/creation controversy as it gives much food for thought from the creation perspective and how the evidence \\""affirms a young Earth!\\"""
1448,2,This book is not as good as I expected. My kitties didnt like these treats :/ Not a good choice.
1449,5,One of my favorite comic book arcs.  And definitely one of my favorite Superman comic book arcs.  A must read for Superman fans
1450,1,"This is a terrible, terrible book -- perhaps even a dishonest one. The author makes generalizations about the gay population based on surveys of people seeking treatment for STDs. Frankly, if someone wrote a book about straight based solely on a sample like that, straight people wouldn't come off so well, either. Over and over, Schmidt used studies where the author says the results cannot be generalized to the entire gay population, but Schmidt goes ahead and does it anyway.<br /><br />If you base your beliefs on this book, your beliefs are sure to be mistaken."

1452,3,"I pre-ordered this seemingly quite appealing magazine and had to wait a long time for it to arrive, and when it did I was a bit surprised, perhaps unjustly, discovering that it was not so much a book as a lavish magazine dedicated to discussing the ISB and other associated bands and solo artists. It was a feast of recognition, of course - alongside one to two page elaborations on every ISB record and a few early Heron and Williamson solo records, there are 2-4 page articles about Dr Strangely Strange, COB, Forest, Dando Shaft, Anne Briggs, Comus, Spirogyra and a few others, as well as an article about the (music of the film) 'The Wicker Man', which I would not have included as it's a bit of an oddity here (and a decidedly flawed film).<br /><br />Practically all artists discussed here are well represented in my lp and cd collection and it was really nice to get some more background information about a few of them. But quite often, especially with regards to the ISB, I didn't really read anything I didn't already know, and its content even shows that it's most certainly not up to date as the article about Williamson's solo career is trying to make us to believe that 'The Iron Stone' is his latest solo album - which is quite ridiculous as that album was released in 2006 (!) and at least two albums have been released on the Quadrant label since.<br /><br />\\""Witches Hats & Painted Chariots\\"" is a very well-presented and colourful music magazine, which I read with pleasure, but it's arguably on the shallow side, not up to date and not stating anything new. It's likely to appeal die hard fans of the ISB and acid folk in general (like me) and young people starting out in the field of acid/nu/new folk, providing them with useful information about some key players in the classic acid folk scene."
1453,5,"A must read for anyone who is interested in the somewhat 'rags to riches' story of one of the<br />early iron mining and timber barons of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and the Mesabe<br />Range of Minnesota, as told by a great grandson of John Monroe Longyear."
1454,5,"Like a lot of board books, this often serves more as a chewy product than as a reading book, but this is popular one for both eating and reading for my friend, so I guess it is a success :)"
1455,5,"great book series, was sent what was ordered in a reasonable time period with minimal ware on the used book."
1456,5,"I instantly fell in love with Lexi and Jude and could not put the book down.  I even fell in love with Lexi's place of business \\""Java and Sweeties\\"" and have the place totally pictured in my mind.  The author's writing style is very easy to follow, realistic and easy to relate to. I love that the story is told from both perspectives.  I will recommend this book to others.  I can't wait to read book two and also to read more from this new and exciting author. :)"
1457,4,It's too bad Jim Fergus doesn't have any more books like this one and his<br />book on 1000 White Women.  I like his writing style  and they way he<br />incorporates some factual history in his books.
1458,4,This book really tells the challenges of raising sheep.  My favorite farm pet from the 50s was a pet lamb.  I am currently getting ready to publish this story.  This book reminded me of some crazy sheep and lamb moments of my past.  This story is  told with love and  humor.
1459,5,Accurate review and summary of main points of most popular religions; easy to follow and the prime of each approach.
1460,3,If you read the series just re-read it to get better insight. This doesn't tall me much I didn't already know.
1461,1,"Goes on unnecessary tangents that take away from the point the readings are trying to make.  Poorly organized.  It's really just bad philosophy, totally inaccessible and takes multiple pages of tangents to give a comprehensive understanding of the material.  There are better books out there that do the job way better."
1462,5,My 9-year old son is an avid reader and has really enjoyed the first two books of this series. He's looking forward to the next book coming out.
1463,3,I read this book cover to cover and enjoyed it but it is not my favorite Carolyn Graham Inspector Barnaby<br />mystery. I am now reading her Death of a Hollow Man and am enjoying it much more.  The characters in Disguise were somewhat difficult to put into context and the ending and solution seemed a little rushed.
1464,5,"Having no previous exposure to physics, this book made me fall in love with it. It really is a well structured book that allows you to absorb a lot of material in a short amount of time.<br />I wish they would do some major updates on relativity and particle physics. Those last chapters are usually skipped in Physics 2 so they are pretty short in this book. Overall Giancoli and his team have done a good job."
1465,5,This is a book I have used in the past on several occasions and have misplaced or lost it.  It is good.
1466,5,Loved reading about and seeing photos of where I was born and raised! Brought back many memories. Would highly recommend it to anyone born or raised in Port Richmond or Kensington.
1467,4,"That's really interesting and easy-to-get kind of material, both as a book and as an audio supplement. Who started newly to learn German language would definitely benefit from these excellent learning tool!"
1468,4,"so far information of value in deciding what path to follow. book is clearly written and discusses what should be in living trust and what not to be in living trust. offers options other than living trust, have not looked at sample document but from what I have read does not appear complicated. it should be noted that author does say when legal help is necessary. in any case if I did my own trust I would have a lawyer familiar with such documents review. so the book could save thousand's in fees clearly a bargain."
1469,4,"A great read describing the origins of Akuma and his seduction to the Dark Hadou. This book includes the 20+ year development of Akuma as a child, to his training with Goutsetsu and more, but there are several gaps in the story that makes one scratch their head, including not revealing how he learned certain killing techniques that made him famed and feared in the Street Fighter world.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the art is extremely detailed and a worthy addition to UDON's Street Fighter comic line. Includes easter eggs and fan service for any Akuma fan. Would certainly recommend this to anyone who's a fan of SF or Akuma, but don't expect a full origin, this graphic novel catalogs bits and pieces of Akuma's life from childhood to at least 10-15 years before his \\""killing\\"" of Gouken."
1470,5,In my opinion this reader is great..  This book is a keeper.  Grabs you til the end.<br /><br />Nice Purchase.  Highly recommended
1471,1,"Since its publication, a majority of the members of the 9/11 Commission itself have gone on record in the mainstream media as saying that they DO NOT BELIEVE the conclusions contained in their report.<br /><br />Every one of them stated explicitly that they were given incomplete, cherry-picked data to base their conclusions on, and if they had access to the full spectrum of intel available on the subject, they would have come to a radically different conclusion (& for the record, those members who still stand by the report all have serious conflicts of interest in the matter).<br /><br />Therefore, one very simple (and very pointed) question must be asked of and answered by the American people:<br /><br />To wit- WHY on Earth do you still believe the blatantly false 9/11 Commission Report when the COMMISSION ITSELF does not even believe it?<br /><br />My theory answering this is that Americans are either too ignorant, too arrogant (exceptionalist), or, most likely, simply too SCARED to deal with such an ugly truth.  Yes, we love waving our flags and congratulating ourselves over the achievements of our forefathers, but when it comes down to it, despite the slogan we love to describe ourselves with, this is NOT the \\""home of the brave\\"" (and in post-Patriot-Act America, we're not the \\""land of the free\\"" anymore, either).<br /><br />It has been twelve years since this heinous crime occurred, and the amount of information that has come out exposing every angle of the attack is such that any American who cannot see the Truth of the matter is either cognitively impaired somehow (too much TV, poisoned food/water, & increasingly \\""dumb-it-down\\"" political & religious ideologies), or is specifically trying to avoid the truth.  Anyone following these lines of \\""reasoning\\"" or action are not being true to the values they claim to possess as Americans.  Real Americans stand for truth, freedom & justice when either one is threatened, regardless of either the enormity of the threat they face, or the consequences that recognizing truth may have for their preconceived beliefs.  Alas, reality will always be reality- and that will continue to be the case regardless of whether or not you deign to recognize it as such.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------<br /><br />QUOTES:<br /><br />9/11 Commission Member Max Cleland Alleges a White House Cover-up<br /><br />\\""President Bush personally has nixed the effort of the 9-11 Commission to get all the documents in the White House, especially the Presidential daily briefs, which basically tell the Commission and the American people what the President knew and when he knew it in regards to the potential attack on 9-11 and the attack itself and the follow-up. He has personally nixed that information coming to 9-11. That means to me that all of the members of that commission will never get to see the real documents that I think are sensitive. The President, as I think John Kerry mentioned, had time to go to rodeo, but didn't have time to appear fully before the 9-11 commission. Truth of the matter is, the White House has played cover-up and a slow walk to this game from the beginning...The commission had to subpoena the F.A.A. for documents, had to subpoena NORAD for documents and they will never get the full story. That is one of the tragedies. One of these days we will have to get the full story because the 9/11 issue is so important to America. But this White House wants to cover it up.\\"" [1]<br /><br /> -Max Cleland, 9/11 Commission member, \\""The White House Has Played Cover-Up\\""<br /><br />In addition to the above statement by Max Cleland about a White House cover up, commission members have revealed that they \\""were setup to fail,\\"" the \\""CIA obstructed our investigation,\\"" the statements made by NORAD officials \\""was just so far from the truth,\\"" that they were \\""extremely frustrated with the false statements we were getting,\\"" and they \\""don't believe for a minute that we got everything right.\\""<br /><br />------------------------------------------------<br /><br />There it is.  That's all straight from the horse's mouth, folks- from the very people whose model of reality you continue to trumpet even as they themselves have abandoned it in the light of truth.  That means you have NO EXCUSE WHATSOEVER to dismiss calls fro further inquiry into this subject.  By extension, that also means that if you DO, in fact, choose to keep denying reality, that the true reasons behind your doing so (either/both intellectual and/or moral failings) are laid bare for all to see.  So stop PRETENDING to be an American, and start living up to the responsibility of actually BEING one."
1472,4,This is OK but he basically says men they are like little boys - just grown up which I don't totally agree with for all men. The last quarter is reiteration. It is well written and a bit humorous.
1473,4,"How to review Les Miserables? This book in its unabridged format can be around 1500 pages long, so there is really no way to say the entire book is detestable or every page is amazing. What I can say is that if you have only been to the musical or watched the movie, you are missing out on the depth of the story and character development that takes place within this impressive tome.<br /><br />**Some spoilers may follow**<br /><br />I adored Hugo's beautiful style of writing and the way he weaves together the lives and personalities of his cast of characters. Sure, most people know that Fantine dies, Jean Valjean dedicates his life to Cosette, and loveable little Gavroche dies at the barricade along with many other idealistic young men. But the musical does not tell you the full reach of the Thenadiers' horrific deeds that they justify in the name of earning a few sous. Far from the fun-loving innkeepers who pick a few pockets, they are thieves, child abandoners, and quite possibly murderers. Reading the novel we learn of Marius' connection to the villainous innkeeper, estrangement from his grandfather, and complete selflessness. Even Javert had moments where he made me smile with his incredible confidence and belief in right triumphing over evil (as long as it was his version of 'right').<br /><br />Unfortunately, the novel also includes chapters like \\""Ancient History of the Sewer,\\"" \\""The Quic Obscurum of Battles,\\"" and \\""To Wit, the Plan of Paris in 1727.\\"" Hugo includes pages and pages . . . . and a few more pages of tangents, unnecessary history, and love letters/songs/poetry. Some chapters kept me riveted to the page, others I skimmed, glassy-eyed.<br /><br />I adored the beginning chapters describing Bishop Myriel, who purchases Jean Valjean's virtue at the cost of his remaining silver. He is portrayed as forgiving and kind in the musical. In the novel, he is more Christ-like a person than most of us will ever meet. He is selfless, loving, humble, and remarkable in his faith. Without him, the story of Jean Valjean could not happen. I read these opening chapters and was eager to carry on, but no other portion of the book pulled me in like this part did.<br /><br />Would I recommend it? If you enjoy long rambling, classically written, history-heavy books, this book has themes in it that are touching and well worth the time it takes to get through it. If you are just curious about what else happens that's not in the movie, you'll probably never get through it. Try an abridged version. If you want more of the love story between Marius and Cosette, you should know that the two exchange few words. Les Miserables has it all - love, betrayal, sacrifice, revolution, oppression, faith, and social issues. Sometimes it even has a bit too much.his faith.

1475,5,"I'm not normally a big fan of prequels. I kind of like my stories to flow in an orderly manner. However, this author is so good at immersing you into the story that I didn't care. I found myself reading faster to see what happened and then slowing down because I didn't want it to end.<br />I cannot wait 6 more days for the next book!!!<br />This storyline is Hollywood worthy, with the right actors this (and the revelations series) could be a big hit. Just, please, don't ruin the magic."
1476,4,Witty and holds your attention. Love the characters and descriptions of Charleston. I am a born and bred Southerner and this is almost too true!
1477,5,This is a classic.  It kept me going on two five-hour plane flights.  Well-written and engrossing.  I was sad to turn the last page.
1478,5,Man's a genius. Forgotten more about golf than most other people will ever know. Would recommend this book to anyone wanting to improve their game.
1479,5,"Historic fiction is a mixed genre.  Many are stories set in a historic context, they could just as well be westerns or scifi. To my mind the best HF are those in which history is brought to life in a story.  All of Peake's Marching with Caeser novels hit this mark.  They are well researched and engaging, solidly great reads."
1480,5,Cut out dresses and hot glued them to a wooden screwer.  I placed one in each flower arrangement on all the tables for a luncheon/fashion show.  It was a hit!
1481,4,Didn't really need it. I had the original Harbinger book and it was very complete. The companion however would make an exultant study book for a class!
1482,5,"A great book for anybody that wants to learn more about autism, or work with children with autism. It gives you there perspective"
1483,4,"I read this right on the heels of reading Ray Kurzweil's \\""The Singularity is Near\\"", which makes for a fascinating juxtaposition.  This book will be a good starting point for my own further research into the ideas presented.  Basically, David Noble traces a history of the \\""religion of technology\\"" in the West, from about 900 to the present day.  He identifies a shift in Western Christian thinking around the 9th-10th centuries as the beginning of this religion of technology - the \\""image of God\\"" in man became identified with both the body and soul, instead of just the soul as had been thought up to that point.  The other cause he identifies throughout the book is the influence of chiliastic thinking - the millennial expectation of the Kingdom of Heaven on earth, that mankind is to use rationalism and technology to regain its pre-fallen state and either usher in paradise on earth through technology, or use technology to be best prepared to residence in the Kingdom of Heaven.<br /><br />I would have liked a much deeper engagement with the causes and nature of this shift in thinking, but according to the author, \\""the reasons remain obscure\\"".  It is a bit frustrating throughout the book that the author is apparently completely ignorant of the existence of Christianity outside of western Europe, and the significant and enlightening differences between the two.  For example, Eastern Christianity never identified the \\""image of God\\"" with both body and soul, but emphatically only the soul.  Likewise, chiliasm (millennialism) never took hold in Eastern Christianity (Orthodoxy), where the quest for perfection was always a quest for internal perfection, a paradise of the heart, not paradise on earth.  A discussion of this difference would have been enlightening, or at least a deeper look at this shift in the West that the author identifies - it seemed like a crucial point to me.<br /><br />Overall, his engagement with his subject is a bit superficial.  Granted, this is a work of pop history not an academic text, but his heavy reliance on secondary sources left me wondering if his analysis was just the rehashed conclusions of works that support his thesis rather than a critical engagement with the subject matter.  For example, is his emphasis on the influence of Joachim of Fiore accurate? Is he fairly presenting the theological position of Scotus Erigena, or distorting it to fit his thesis? Am I being misled for the sake of his ultimate motives?<br /><br />By the time I reached the end of the book, I felt justified in this feeling as the author's ultimate position is finally revealed.  He opens the book saying \\""It is the aim of this book to demonstrate that the present enchantment with things technological - the very measure of modern enlightenment - is rooted in religious myths and ancient imaginings.\\""  In the final chapter, tellingly titled \\""The Politics of Perfection\\"", he explicitly states his true thesis - to demonstrate that the \\""religion of technology\\"" is ultimately driven not by a desire to improve this world, but by the basically religious desire to transcend and escape this world.<br /><br />The problem with this thesis is that it is easily contradicted by a fair reading of today's technological futurists like Ray Kurzweil, who, in \\""The Singularity is Now\\"" certainly expresses desire to transcend this world through technology, but also constantly justifies advances in genetic engineering, nanotech, and advanced AI robotics by discussing the tremendous benefits to humanity and the promise of greatly alleviating human suffering.  To oppose these technologies is to perpetuate massive human suffering for the sake of Luddite ideology, according to Kurzweil. This only confirms my suspicions that the author is more concerned with grinding his axe than with really getting to the bottom of these issues.<br /><br />Despite my reservations, I still give the book four stars because, for me, it has provided a fascinating introductory study of connections between certain tendencies in Christian thought and the technological impulse. The author has done a good enough job that I had a thrilling read, and a lot of resources to keep me busy in my own research for years to come.ctions between certain tendencies in Christian thought and the technological impulse.

1484,5,"I found all the information quite interesting.  Race relations is a major focus, given Loewen's teaching background, but I found the other topics more interesting.  This is more of a lecture on cd than it is a book on cd.  Very similar to Lies My Teacher Told Me but has a few different topics."
1485,5,This was a book I bought because it was required for a course for college.  It really helped with my studies.
1486,2,"This was interesting, but too much like a text book.  I only bought it because it was suggesed when I was on a recent trip to Russia. It arrived on time and the book itself was as advertised.  I had no problem with the seller but the book was ot what I hoped it would be"
1487,5,Great read for the whole family.  The video is also a great accompaniment.  You'll never get bored with the story.
1488,5,"I bought this book after hearing one of the authors speak at a conference.  I was impressed at the depth of the lessons (all common core connected) as well as their potential appeal to students.  I used the first one with my MS language arts class and it was a hit!  Looking forward to using many of the others.  Practical, intellectually sound, and useful for CC alignment.<br />Janet"
1489,3,"Oftentimes, the book gives more detail about the story than the movie that follows.  However, in this case, the book was very vague.  The only plus I found to purchasing the book was the high gloss photos located in the middle of the book.  Other than that, I could have passed on purchasing the book; especially at the price it was sold for.  I will get the DVD of the movie when it becomes available.  Lee Daniels did an excellent job adapting the book into a wonderful work of art!"
1490,5,"I recommend Rose Moore Tomlin's Duel of the Heart as outstanding history telling. I thoroughly enjoyed the well-researched descriptions of Theodosia Burr Alston's intriguing, yet difficult life - one of privilege, commitments, politics, love and loss - resulting in the frustration that long-lasting happiness was always beyond her reach.<br /><br />Theodosia's days in coastal South Carolina gave Tomlin the opportunity to feature much of the low country's culture during the period 1794-1813 which made the book more meaningful for me as a transplanted Northerner.<br /><br />Ron Copsey<br />Greenville, SC<br />September 2, 2013"

1493,5,"\\""The Greatest Gift\\"" is a sort of Advent calendar and devotional all wrapped together. 25 days of Advent each have their own reading, with passages from the Old and New Testament. Each has an ornament of cut white paper, elegantly designed as an illustration. But that's not all; you can download these beautiful designs and create your own \\""Jesse Tree\\"" representing the House of Jesse, who was King David's father and ancestor of Jesus. Jesse's family tree, the mighty House of David was cut down over time but revitalized when Jesus was born as the Messiah. You make a Jesse Tree (on paper, felt or a real tree) and hang each ornament in its time.<br /><br />The idea is that over 25 days of devotional reading, you and your family will come into the Christmas season fully steeped in the meaning of Christmas and have a beautiful Christmas decoration to remind you of the journey.<br /><br />This is a lovely idea for families. It would even work for a prayer group. The ornaments are so beautifully designed, yet elegantly simple in their white layers of cut paper, that it would be a joy to re-create them. The ornaments are not just Christmas-themed; the one of Noah's Ark is particularly lovely and many of the designs would make delightful cards to send to friends. So this book is not just useful for Christmas. If you enjoy crafts with paper or scrapbooking, there is a lot here you could adapt for other uses.<br /><br />If your family is looking for something to make a more meaningful Christmas and retain the Christmas message amid all the jollity and distractions of the season, I can hardly think of a better idea."
1494,4,I enjoyed this book for me it was a light read --- One that I didn't want to stop -- wished I had found it sooner - the dynamics of the characters was great -- I would have loved to hear more about the grandmother and how she wound up in her chocolate state lol maybe I will find it in another volume I had never heard of this author before -- I made a connection with these characters it was great
1495,5,"My son loves this author and loved the book.  I haven't had time to look on his 3 walls of books for it.  I'll find it one of these days and read it.  There was another book by this author, too, that was very good."
1496,5,"Originally when I began reading this book I expected to find handy little tips on earthquake supplies, baby-proofing, first-aid, and generally, figuring out how to make my life \\""safe\\"".  Anyone who knows me at all knows that I'm big into safety.  Hate flying. Drive like an old lady.  But I will say, too, that since the title included the word \\""Tao\\"", I figured I was in for a little bit of Eastern philosophy, which is just fine for me.  I'm a yoga teacher. So safety and yin/yang all rolled into one?  Perfect.<br /><br />What I found instead was a thoughtful exploration of how we can use our senses, our intuition, and our decision-making skills to navigate the craziness that life throws our way.<br /><br />There are lots of practical exercises throughout the book which can be used to sharpen our senses and improve our ability to perceive in more subtle ways.  My personal suggestion is to just read the book through once before beginning to tackle the exercises so that you have a clear sense of where all this is taking you.  For me, anyway, that helps to really engage in the exercises with a sense of purpose.  (When I say \\""purpose\\"" I mean - Would you like to be able to recognize a psychopath at a party and maybe deter them from an act of violence?  Would you like to be able to see in the dark when all the power goes out?  Hint:  Wear sunglasses in the daytime.  Really!)  So it's not just \\""woo-woo\\"" at all. It's  very practical.<br /><br />This is a book about saving  - not only our own lives, but the lives of our loved ones  If you read the book beyond the exercises (and you should!) you will also see that the author is not only concerned with our individual lives, but also the survival of humans as a species and even the survival of the planet. This is a book I will come back to over and over again. It's a great read, and it's really a manual for conscious living."
1497,5,This book is so much fun.  The hats are simple to knit and quick.  My pre-teen/teen daughters adore them!  I have already made the bunny and the frog.  More to come!
1498,5,"I borrowed  book one & three from a friend and was very pleased with Jack Whyte. I purchased book two for my friend but read it first. This is a very good book, well written and full of history of the time. Now I have to borrow book three again to make it all come together."
1499,5,"I'll admit after having lived in Baltimore for three years that I had some preconceptions about the story. But, once I started reading I quickly put those preconceptions to the side and by page 188 I was hooked. Raquel and Marcus were not written as your typical romance characters nor were they written as the typical clich&eacute;d characters either. Each of their characters had strong, sexy and intelligent character arcs. As with the other reviewers, I couldn't stop reading until the last sentence. Baltimore Heat, in basketball parlance, is a three point fade away jumper that's all net from the top of the key!"

Chef Katie's writing style is fun, energetic and easy to follow as are her recipes, which even a novice can master.  We live in a 'Food Network' society these days as everyone seems to be interested in trying new ingredients, herbs, spices and flavor profiles.  Unfortunately, not everyone in the family is equally as 'adventurous'; however, we found ways to modify a few ingredients to satisfy everyone's taste buds -- even our most finicky eater!  We absolutely loved the Pad Thai, Shaking Beef and Chiang Mai Chicken in Lettuce Cups!<br /><br />Chef Katie lives up to her Culinary POV by debunking some long-held 'myths' about Asian cuisine -- specifically, Thai cooking -- showing how you can incorporate easily accessible ingredients into a wide variety of great dishes that are simple to prepare and serve to your family and guests."

1509,5,"\\""The Enraged\\"", Greg Battles' seventh Jonathan Quinn novel picks up with the cliffhanger at the end of \\""The Collected\\"" so be sure to read that one first.  This one has it all for Quinn fans--a tight uncluttered plot, intense emotional stress, the usual favorite characters and a few new ones, and a search for satisfying revenge.  Quinn does what he does best but with a more focused goal, thanks to the killing of Peter and severe wounding of Orlando at the end of \\""The Collected\\"".<br /><br />Quinn learns that Peter was close to ferreting out the culprit responsible for the torturing of Nate and his colleagues and for his own ultimate death; indeed, the culprit may have been at the center of a much bigger and deadlier conspiracy that involved Peter's late wife.  Quinn cannot sit idly back so he jumps into action to follow through on Peter's search relying heavily on Peter's former secretary, Misty Blake.  As the insidious conspiracy begins to unravel, Quinn, Nate, and Daeng along with a new character, Steve Howard, race to avoid being eliminated by a team of assassins while developing the plot to expose the perpetrators and exact revenge for Peter and the others who were tortured and/or shot.<br /><br />For fans of the Jonathan Quinn series, this is a keeper.  It was a joy seeing Quinn employ all his secret op skills to thwart a number of hired killers while working his way to the top of the food chain.  The appearance of a new character potentially to replace Peter adds an intriguing element to the story.  Battles has created a group of characters so fully fleshed that we readers care strongly for them and quickly identify with their idiosyncrasies, emotions, and foibles.  His writing is engaging, crisp, and  believable.  I highly recommend this entire series!"
1510,5,"A great story for the young, another book in Ms. Donaldson's fashion of writing, always witty, well thought-out and presented with great illustrations. I would personally recommend this book for almost any age."
1511,5,"It was a nice book but I barely used it for my online courses in school. Maybe I'll get to use it more, but if not, I'll re-sell it on here."
1512,5,"This is a follow on from in times of violence; it is about the daughter of the leader's gang Tyrants and her revenge. This book is very more in death to outlaw bikers' ways and is shocking in places but I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and did not want to put the book down. You felt you were a part of her path; I was a little disappointed with the ending as you don't see what happens to mud. Maybe another ending would be she gets the Wolves to turn against mud and they kill him, as I feel she is very bright and could have pulled that off very well. There is some very in death sexual bits in it witch may be a bit shocking to some so be warned. i feel it is a very good follow on book and it was nice to see how the Tyrants leaders survived later in life. Can't wait to read another of this author's books question is which one next hummmm"
1513,5,"Maggie Brock is a divorced, single mom.  Life is relatively normal until an angel shows up.  At first he's just part of a dream.  But then he's in real life.  Others can see him, too.  The angel, Evan, is very attractive and Maggie finds herself drawn to him - hence \\""Divine temptation.\\""  Evan doesn't quite know why he's there, but soon sinister things start happening.  It seems the devil has plans for Maggie.  You'll have to read the book to find out exactly what they are.<br /><br />Divine Temptation is a unique romance in that the romance itself is not the main focus of the story.  It's secondary to a more compelling plot.  I found this to be refreshing, as was the paranormal aspect of the book.  Also commendable is that the characters have depth - strengths and weaknesses, and are not always predictable.  Even the ending was not exactly what I expected.  I would definitely recommend Divine Temptation to those who enjoy romance books."
1514,5,"We originally borrowed this book from the library and then decided just to buy it. My 2yr old daughter pretty much memorized the book and repeats it when it's &#34;Calm down time&#34;. There are great tips for adults on the last page for calming down their children in a loving way. I personally find it it a better approach than &#34;time out&#34;, at least at this age. Teaches kids to breath in and out, count to 3 and take a break in a quiet place, or ask for a hug to help them calm down."
1515,4,"The Incarnation of the Word of God (Large Print) by St. Athanasius is a wonderful classical work.  I needed the version with the introduction by CS Lewis, which this one has.  I did not expect the book itself to be so large.  Yes, I know it is large print but didn't expect the book to be so large in size.  My biggest pet peeve is misspellings.  This copy is rife with typos (\\""bath\\"" is used several times in place of \\""hath\\"" in Biblical quotes, simple words misspelled,  question marks in odd places, one date in the text of the introduction even says \\""194z\\"", etc, etc).  I can only assume this was downloaded from online or disc but never checked for compatibility or accuracy.<br /><br />Despite the editing/typing errors, I would recommend any and every Christian read this treatise on the Incarnation.  It is still very deep but very readable at the same time.  Maybe find a better quality printing of the text."
1516,5,"Easy and informative to read, Tomarken's book contains many \\""aha!\\"" moments. Starting with Jacques Derrida and his theory of decentering, Tomarken progresses through a series of theorists who employ and extend Derrida's insights. The book demonstrates convincingly that the films selected (major releases) proceed from and incorporate those insights in ways that few film buffs, even, may have recognized previously. A great book for amateurs and specialists alike, and a wonderful classroom text."
1517,5,I bought four books from this author. I bought them for my grandkids. Two kids have read them and really liked the book. Both kids said they wanted to read more of his titles. The message in this book was amazing. I would definitely recommend them! Great author/writer and great book!
1518,5,Great set of books. Waiting for the next one in the series. Leaves you wanting to know where it will all end.
1519,5,"I've read 6 books or more now authored by Wasdin, Luttrell, Kyle, Owen, Webb and now Osman. Osman's book definitely havs the greatest amount of detail, in a chronological order, about every aspect of becoming a SEAL and the tools used once becoming an operator. A must read for anyone looking for a full circle account of what to expect as a SEAL. I also recommend checking out the Inside the Team Rooms video series on YouTube which interviews the late Chris Kyle, Chris Osman and Brandon Webb, who taught Kyle in sniper school."
1520,4,"I got this (along with a Uke) for my 11 yr old granddaughter.  The songs are familiar but most a little too difficult for a beginner.  The accompanying CD is nicely done; each song is recorded twice, once with the uke in the arrangement and the second time without the uke so the student can add that part.  A scratch vocal would have been helpful just to keep better track of where you are in the song, but it's pretty well done none the less.  And, having the recorded song is helpful to her when I'm not there.  We started with the song with the fewest number of chord changes (4) and she's slowly working through it and having fun with it.  This is challanging for a beginner but could be a lot of fun for a youngster with intermediate Uke ability."
1521,5,"I haven't actually made anything from this book yet. I'm just reading it cover to cover. Every recipe sounds mouthwatering delish, and most of them seem relatively easy to make. I love that it's organized into specific menus for various occasions. Can't wait to try the Take Out Fake Out since Chinese food has pretty much been off of our radar since going Paleo.  The photos are gorgeous, descriptions scrumptious. Aside from being a Class A cookbook this can also qualify as what we used to call &#34;Coffee Table Books&#34;.<br />I love Bill and Haley's other books but Gather is in a class all it's own."
1522,5,"Rather than simply a sequel to his earlier volume The Republican War on Science (2004), here in The Republican Brain Mooney (2012) presents more than a simple re-listing of new and updated factual errors, misinformation and false beliefs, as frequently expressed by US Republican party supporters. Not that the human (or any other) brain features very prominently in the book either, what instead is to be found is an empirically-defensible thesis which seeks to use differential psychology to explain the thinking (or lack thereof) underlying the many seemingly bizarre beliefs and behaviours repeatedly exhibited by some of the most hard-line US Republican office holders in recent decades (and those of their mentors/supporters). Sometimes the same explanations afford an explanatory account of equally confounding behaviours as are frequently demonstrated by US Democratic Party office holders, but the details (though related), are significantly different, both in their aetiology and maintenance.<br /><br />For the non-American audience-reader, there may be some possible confusion(s) to resolve resulting from the oft interchangeable use of terms of the different in-group affiliations, and descriptive allegiances to stereotype labeling, as employed by the various researchers cited. For example, the dichotomous political pairings of `Republican vs Democrat' may not necessarily map the experimental samples of a given research psychologist's `Authoritarians vs Egalitarians', as examples of each the former pair include examples of both the latter; and likewise, with the categorical usage of `Conservative vs Liberal'.  Mooney's own efforts to be clear as to exactly to whom he is referring in each case is well executed in his writing, though may require some note-taking on the part of those less familiar with these terms. In contrast, Mooney's examples of both the acceptable and unacceptable behaviours recorded of each (their thinking styles, identification and use of facts, etc.), is easily accessed for understanding, even without a working knowledge of American history, economic theory, reproductive or climate science, religious education, or US social policy.<br /><br />But without spoiling the reader's own disentangling fun when exploring Mooney's text for themselves (especially if they are `liberals' ?), it is sufficient to say that the most `enlightening' (and perhaps at first surprising) findings concern Republican Party supporters who tend towards both authoritarian and conservative outlooks on life (and especially so, the religious conservatives). The most convincing data presented in this text involve correlate studies of the personality traits) possessed of politically right-leaning samples (as determined by Big-5 testing, in contrast to those of other party affiliated individuals. To be specific, the personality traits of self-identified `Republicans' vs `Democrats' reveal significantly diametrically opposed scoring levels on each of the first two Big-5 dimensions of Openness and Conscientiousness. Together with many similar findings from psychological, social, educational, and historical research studies (each carefully sourced and documented), Mooney's thesis is built around then using this data for explanatory purposes. It is important to understand, however, that correlation does not imply causation - though his arguments are for the most part clear, consistent, and very helpful with regards their conclusions. Many will wish to use the same data to support the view that Republicans hold (and defend) such-and-such view(s) because their personality then influences or drives their behaviour to be expressed in certain ways (think in-group bias, motivated reasoning, selective exposure, cognitive dissonance, reality denial), whereas others may prefer to conclude that one's particular personality traits might conspire to influence one's `choosing' to become attached to a particular party affiliation in the first place.<br /><br />Todisentangle this last issue, the reader will need await new data (Mooney does include some very preliminary genetic data, and the fMRI studies presented are consistent re limbic vs frontal ACC differences in the different party affiliate's information processing preferences), the emerging multidisciplinary fields of `Neuropolitics' and `Political Neuroscience' will (I believe) look back to this book as a solid source of inspiration in years to come.

1523,5,"skolnicksreport dot org<br /><br />Wow, the stuff this guy writes about is amazing and if you think about the world as well as observe it yourself this stuff makes a chaotic world fit together. The stuff he casually mentions would bring down governments if the public wasn't so brainwashed(conspiracy \\""nuts\\"") and lazy and if there weren't so many mysterious deaths or \\""suicides\\"". Skolnick is perhaps one of those rarest of rare REAL Americans and even beyond that, God bless him.<br /><br />Be careful though as it can be quite traumatic to know this stuff, escapism would be the best choice for most. Creating beauty is one way to do it, through art for myself or simply making the world you live in a better place a little bit at a time in your own way. This is the best way to fight the evil out there, not by self destructing and creating more negativity but by living better foremost through helping others in ways that facilitate them to in turn help people they know. The devils that are in control can at most take your life from you but nothing more, that's where their power stops. There may not be real justice out there, or it may be more rare than diamonds, but do your part in your life however small to at least not add to the shti pile."
1524,2,"I guess I learned some things about myself, but it was nothing I didn't know.  I did not discover what life has in store for me.  I have to stop falling for these books."
1525,5,"Far from being a heart-wrenching read on the order of Angela's Ashes, That's That is pure joy.  Broderick's use of language is gorgeous; his imagery and humor are marvels of style.  His introductory history of Ireland is worth the price of the book.  It distills that beleaguered island's story into wry and pithy factoids that simplify its labyrinthine loyalties and politics.<br /><br />I recently saw a film clip of a speech Queen Elizabeth gave on her recent trip to Ireland.  She gracefully acknowledged that mistakes had been made.  Colin Broderick lived through some of those mistakes, and his story is horrifying, very funny and enlightening.  While it's both a coming of age story and a political commentary, That's That is deeply rooted in family and the ties that bind.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended!"
1526,3,"This book was light and entertaining.  I enjoyed some aspects of the book such as Delilah's Dominatrix training to boost her confidence...but some things I am tired of hearing about...such as Chas's snake-in-the-grass, gold digging nature and Delilah's inability to see the shallow person that he really is.  It absolutely irks me to see her feel grateful for crumbs of attention from an absolute dog.  The other story wasn't as good as this one, but they both seemed to have good moral at the end."
1527,3,"This book was my toddler's favorite (he's now 14months, has been his favorite for a few months). I love that each page has the flaps (and so does he). We received the first as a gift, and some flaps fell off/ spine finally broke, so we ordered a new one.<br /><br />We've only had the new one for a few weeks, though, and another flap has come off. This time, it only lasted a few weeks/ maybe a couple dozen readings. I don't think my toddler is any more abusive than other kids-- he moves the flaps back and forth but doesn't lift the weight of the book by the flaps or anything...<br /><br />so, I would give it 5 stars if only it were constructed better. Oh, and maybe I wish it didn't have the message that snakes like to bite. I figure enough people have unreasonable fears of snakes already. At least where we live, it's silly to fear snakes, and I hope my baby doesn't learn that..."
1528,5,Awesome third book. I couldn't put it down. I hope there is another Gideon and Eva book to finish the story.
1529,5,"This is a very well written book that takes the readers on a state wide tour of large, small, chain and mom and pop family type BBQ joint's throughout the state of Texas. The author doesn't hold back on his descriptions of all places encountered being either good or bad. I would recommend this book for anyone who loves BBQ and road trips."
1530,5,You can't go wrong with this if you are trying to get control of sight reading. It's a great skill and this book starts you off really well.
1531,5,A blend of mythology and poetry that transports you in time and leaves you with a feeling of the warmth of the sun.
1532,5,"Special Strength Training Manual for Coaches is by far the best book I have read on learning about Dr. Verkhoshansky's methods. Before this book I felt I would try to put together what I had read in different articles he wrote and after this book it all pieced together and makes for an easy reference to look back at when using different methods.<br /><br />In the book different subjects such as Dynamic Correspondence, his jumping hierarchy, and programs for various sports are shown. Not only does it give you more detail on the information you may have been trying to figure out from Dr. Verkhoshansky, but it gives you practical examples. Probably one of my top 5 books I look back to all the time. An endless tool!"
1533,4,I ordered this book for my son-in-law's family who live in Belgium and have a greenhouse they use to cultivate different species of cacti.  They loved the book!!!  It was informative and the pictures were amazing!!!  The only con is that it cost a fortune to ship it to Belgium through Amazon so I would recommend checking shipping prices through the post office prior to sending anything overseas directly through Amazoni!!
1534,5,"I started soaping this year and have read at least 8 soaping books to date.  Just received this book today and looked through every page.  I thought this book would be strictly on design techniques but it turns out to be a comprehensive book that even beginners would appreciate.  Unlike other soaping books, this one is RICH with step by step pictures of the cold process as well as the final product.  Anne-Marie covers safety guidelines, equipment, oils, colorants, essential oils and fragrances as well creative molds, additives and swirls.  If you are want to buy only one soaping book, this one will give you all the information you need to get started and advance in the soap crafting passion."
1535,5,"McCarren has summarized the Gospels in such a way that they are easy for anyone to understand. These books can be used in the classroom, Sunday school or home. Anyone who is looking for a better appreciation of the Gospels should read take the time to read these books."
1536,5,Got it before date it said condition was as stated no complaints to be made would order again. Would recommend
1537,5,The pictures were excellent for the story. Was exactly what I needed for our church children's rally. It came promptly.
1538,5,"Each of these poems nudges the reader a bit nearer toward that hole, the aching vacancy that we all must live with after the death of a loved one.  Bryan Borland's talent is giving a voice to his grief, and in doing so, reaching out and humanizing ours.  I doubt it's possible to read more than a few of these at one sitting.  And when I'd finished the last of them, I did what I suspect a lot of readers must do.  I started again at the beginning."
1539,5,"Aslan explores almost a thousand references on the life and times in which Jesus was born as well as books on the historical life of Jesus. His central observation regards the historical import of the crucifixion - that it was reserved for the most dangerous POLITICAL opponents of the Roman Empire.  Historians have often advanced the argument that the persecution of Jesus was largely politically motivated in the past, but Aslan adds a tremendous level of scholarship and weight to the argument.<br /><br />It is a must read for all those interested in the historical Jesus.  It is amusing to see the very large number of one star reviews, 40% of which come from the same geographic node on the internet; most of which were put there within hours of each other when a prominent Evangelical preacher condemned the very idea of a Muslim writing about Jesus.  That is, I would be amused except there are those who take this very obvious hate campaign to reflect the views of actual readers.  Perhaps Amazon needs to build a filter for their reviews to filter out the hate-filled spam campaigns that seem to accompany the publication of any religious work which is not wholly informed by fundamentalist, evangelical superstition and myth."
1540,5,"When the 29/46 Australian Infantry Battalion landed at Malaguna Bay at Rabaul in September 1945 they were opposed by 2 Company's Korean Marines , even by this date there was still fighting in the South West Pacific on the Island of New Britain , A Company 29/46 Aust Inf Battalion by this time jungle warfare professionals used the same tactic as the Japanese on the Koreans and outflanked them , luckily there were no casualties of note on either side. When the Koreans were interrogated by the Australians they had been told they would be shot if they were taken prisoner  . Nothing could have been further from the truth , with the Koreans remarking how well they were treated. Again the Australian were surprised how big the Koreans were mostly over 6 feet tall  This is a well written  book and tells of a subject little know of the Great Pacific War, like any other soldier the young men wanted to go home , if you get the chance buy this book and see the war through the Korean eyes ."
1541,4,"The illustrator is new, and fresh, it's just a bit different than anything I have seen, and I have seen a lot of work. The story is gripping, in a little kid kinda way, as well as metaphorical, imaginative and a bit empowering, perhaps. We liked this one, very much."
1542,4,"This book was as described and I have no complaints, saved money through Amazon. It is amazing how fast Amazon Fulfilled items get to me."
1543,5,"As expected, Linda Castillo delivers with another engaging mystery set in Holmes County, Ohio. Kate Burkholder, the ex-Amish Chief of Police, fears discovery of her part in the disappearance of a young Amish man many years before. Kate tries to solve a murder while attempting to define her relationship with John Tomasetti who is also in law enforcement. I couldn't put it down!"
1544,5,"Great book! It's written for the cocktail lover who wants to not only enjoy the drink, but the story behind it. Molly Wellmann knows her stuff and writes in a way that s both educational and entertaining."
1545,5,"Beside the quality contents of book, i liked the matter as specific cases and the overall style for each cases.<br /><br />Had a complete hassel free purchase and without any follow ups could manage to get the book to my office in very decent time gap.<br /><br />All sales personnel must read and implement this book."
1546,4,I've done comparative checking for this book and amazon had the best price.  I would recommend this book to others.
1547,3,"Very early novels tended to include a little disclaimer at their beginnings that said something along the lines of, \\""This is a true and moral account for the instruction of the young so that they will better understand the ways of the world.\\""<br /><br />These novels then tended to tell the wildest tales possible, striving to thrill and astonish readers, and with little real concern for the moral message. In other words, every word of the disclaimer was inaccurate.<br /><br />I tend to view this memoir in the same way. Some of this might have happened, more or less as Walls tells it, but I've got my doubts. (We never really should take memoirs as the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, by the way.)<br /><br />Viewed as a work of fiction, it's not really all that compelling, but it does give comfortable middle-class readers access to a certain view of the world of the American underclass. Whether that world is really as dysfunctional and absurd as seen here is an open question.<br /><br />For greater insight into those on the bottom, their strivings and emotions, perhaps try William Faulkner or John Steinbeck or Zora Neale Hurston."

1550,5,Lost 15 lbs overall so far after completing two cycles of the Shred Diet. But most importantly I am learning how to eat smaller meals regularly and not over-stuff myself by only eating two larger meals per day. This was a problem for me before becoming a Shredder and caused gastrointestinal upset often. Since starting this program I feel lighter and no longer battle with bloating and other issues that go along with eating larger meals. That has really been the biggest difference the diet has provided me--eating something every several hours. I was pretty much already a healthy eater but had reached my plateau at weight loss.
1551,5,"When I purchased this book I had assumed that the writer was \\""Tap\\"" Tapply, book author and outdoor columnist. As it turns out the author is the son of Tap Tapply. Regardless, I was not at all disappointed once I delved into the book. This is no how-to book but instead a light-hearted, very well-written assortment of essays on New England upland bird hunting and fishing. William Tapply pokes fun at some of the snobbish attitudes of elitist fly-fisherman and wing-shooters. He admits to having shot a sitting grouse as a young boy and to having intentionally fished for bluegills as an adult and even to having fished with live worms. No elitist is he! Highly recommended for a quick and enjoyable read. As a side-note for fans of Burt Spiller, this book should be on your library shelf. As a young man Bill Tapply frequently hunted with an aging Spiller and he is featured in more than one of the essays collected here. If you're a grouse hunter and are not familiar with Spiller's books, start with this one and then move on to \\""Grouse Feathers\\""."
1552,2,"It started out funny. It quickly grew into a bore. Like a chain story created by successive writers, it's plot meandered and came across as contrived. I couldn't stand it. It had no redeeming elements except a bit of humor in some places. Most places the attempted humor didn't come off."
1553,5,I have not finished reading this book yet but it is worth reading.  I notice the other day there was mention of this event and if it was deliberate or accidental as to what happened to it.  I know I have made up my mind because of the preponderance of evidence.  It is a great book though with easy reading and very exciting at times.  I think it will appeal to anyone who enjoys a mystery from time to time.
1554,3,Was slanted toward political and religious issues.  What I wanted was more about Rome's engineering and medical triumphs for their time.  Hope to find a book about that!
1555,5,Alperovitz is a revolutionary leader and a harbinger of hope.  Share this book with your liberal and/or conservative friends and make a change in our future!
1556,2,"The Content is not worthy of such pricing.<br /><br />This book does not contain major theory/concept/formular explanation, only lists of diagram."
1557,5,"I bought this book because it was recommended by a cousin who advised that my brother, Mike Christie, was in the book frequently. I remember when he came home. he didn't talk much at all about his experiences. This book helped to inform me about his heroism and the courage and sacrifice of the men in his unit. I wrote to Dwight Birdwell and he said he will always remember Mike's bravery and he was very generous with his time.Dwight is a very likable guy who did some very extraordinary things.. My brother said that Dwight was the most heroic soldier he had the honor and pleasure to know.I thank Dwight for bringing me closer to knowing Mike Christie and the young men he fought with. What he did tell me later on jives with Dwight's very honest account of things. God bless you Dwight and God bless all who made it home and those who didn't, and their families. The book is a hell of a ride."
1558,4,This was a very comprehensive study guide. It was well worth the investment of time and money. It helped me pass!
1559,3,"In this book we mostly hear from Hannah as she tells her own story of being pregnant at age fifteen. Her home life is in a shambles after the sudden accidental death of her father two years ago. Her mother has a host of problems stemming from the loss and Hannah has been picking up the slack. No one realizes the extent of the problem because everyone else has their own issues.<br /><br />  Now Hannah finds herself in a precarious situation with being pregnant and still tasked with the care of her remaining parent. Everything begins getting to her and she lands in a mental hospital where she learns to cope with her own life and her mother begins to get the help she needs to be a better parent to her teenage daughter.<br /><br />  While most of this book is told in Hannah's voice we also hear from Trilby, Hannah's childhood friend, and Roman, the brother of the the boy that impregnated Hannah.<br /><br />  I can't really say that I enjoyed this book enough to give it a recommendation. I wanted to keep reading it to see how it would turn out in the end but I don't think I would have missed anything if I had never come across this book at all."
1560,4,"I always have problems summing up a Christian non-fiction book.  I will do my best to stay focused and on track.  Samuel Rodriguez covers many issues that Christians face in America today.  Mostly he stress the point that we should meet God on the vertical direction of the cross and with those around us on the horizontal plane with those around us.<br /><br />The vertical seems rather easy.  Worship in Spirit and in Truth.  The horizontal part is some times difficult in that we often times find it hard to love those in our horizontal plane such as the homosexual, the illegal immigrant, or abortion activist.  This may be hard but we are called to do just that.  Something that he pointed out in the book rang very true in my ears.  Though we are to be gentle as lambs we can be bold as lions when it comes to our faith.  We don't have to accept abortion, we don't have to agree with the homosexual or the illegal.  But we love them and stand firm on the Word of God.<br /><br />Mr. Rodriguez compares several famous men in America's history.  Billy Graham (promoter of the vertical), Martin Luther King Jr. (promoter of the horizontal),  William Wilberforce (horizontal as well as vertical), Bill Wilson (both planes of the cross), and many more.<br /><br />Comparisons between the Donkey (demacrats) and the Lamb, the Elephant (republicans) and the Lamb and the agenda's of each.  They very rarely if ever coincide.  I enjoyed this book for the rich history content.  I think Mr. Rodriguez is right on when he tries to impress that we are to care for those around us and that the entire world is watching what we as Christians are doing.  I am keeping this book in my personal library for future reference material. It was given to me free of charge for a fair and honest review by Booksneeze."
1561,5,Very helpful book. Well organized and an overall enjoyable read. It's a great resource and I will definitely get a lot of use out of it.
1562,4,The book is GREAT. The holder for the disc was cracked and broken but it did not affect the CD's. I would have liked to have known this before I placed the order as it was to be given as a gift.
1563,5,This book is very applicable for fishing in Connecticut.  I enjoyed reading it and feel that is a good reference book for a salt water fisherman.
1564,4,"I bought this book because Goodis was frequently referred to in essays about noir fiction.  I read the whole thing in 2 days.  Some were better than others, but especially Dark Passage and The Burglar were my favorites.  Now I understand why Goodis was such an influence on writers that followed."
1565,2,"I haven't finished this book yet, so maybe this is premature, but I loved Hosseini's other books and was so excited to read this while on vacation.  Parts of it are interesting, but I can't stand the fact that he brings in all these characters and tells all their stories without any passion.  I'm starting to not care about the new characters and I've forgotten all the old ones.  I know in the end he'll bring it all together wonderfully, hopefully, and give this reader a sense of completion, but right now Im skimming the story to get to that part.  The characters are only partially developed because there's another one looming in the next chapter to take his or her place.  The lives of the characters are so fragmented that I really just want to stop reading.  Sorry, Hosseini, I'm just not that into you anymore."
1566,5,Not a big &#34;Dr. Phil&#34; fan but have to admit this book rocks.  It looks at life situations from a different perspective.  I'm always ready to listen to that.  Great read.
1567,5,This is one the finest warbler guides on the market. Amazing pictures!!! Unbeatable charts. A MUST have guide on any birders shelf. Recommend this highly!!!
1568,5,Nicely written teen novel series.  Enjoyable.  Clean ethics.  Interesting plot line.  Fits male and female interests equally (interestingly enough).  We had just one question when we were finished:  Is this the end?
1569,2,Just some nice photos from country living -- nothing I had not seen before.  It could have been much better.
1570,3,"Well it is a book that has been primed with award, but I did not really like it, neither my 4 years old daughter."
1571,5,The book is clearly written and an easy read. The book has good information in it so you never want to put it down. The book exceeds my expectations.
1572,5,"This book is a \\""must read\\"" book for pastors and laymen. It is unfortunate that most churches have relinquished preaching and teaching of this book of the New Testament Canon to popular preachers with speculative theologies. The book helped me understand the importance of understanding the text in the context of God's story of creation, salvation as well as the end of the story of a new creation.... all by the suffering of the slaughtered lamb. Reading this with Darrell Johnson's \\""Discipleship on the Edge\\"", GK Beale's Commentary, and \\""The triump of the Lamb\\"". Dr. Effird's Breaking the Code is also excellent. Yes, even as a layman, these books are encouraging to live life in obedience and in the knowledge that God is on the throne, working out His purposes. We may not understand them, but we can rest knowing that the God is ruling His creation and is in control."
1573,5,"Nancy Bevilaqua has written a memoir of the last days of the 1980s that is tender, desperate, loving, searching, and quietly profound. Holding Breath is the best of what indie published books can be. It is raw, natural and unabashedly lyrical. I truly recommend buying and reading this book if you want to get to know a strong and charismatic real life guy whose life ended tragically.<br /><br />I also recommend this story because it is one of the more touching love stories I've come across in quite a while. Imagine someone coming to you, saying, \\""Write me a love story where the lovers are not able to express their love for each other. They never kiss, let alone physically consummate that love. They're barely able to think about their feelings. Oh, and make it really good.\\"" Nancy Bevilaqua didn't just come up with a story like this, she lived it. And it wasn't easy. It's a good story, even though it is so heart breaking, because of the author's strength and honesty in telling it to us.<br /><br />I intend to write a longer review of this book at my website in a week or two once I've recovered from reading Holding Breath, but I really wanted to get something up here on Amazon, because I feel strongly that this Indie Author deserves your attention now."
1574,1,"If you love wine then you have to add Friends of Wine to your collection. A personal insight to the families that make the wines we enjoy.  The funny moments captured by Michael gives this book a uniqueness unlike other books.<br />This book will be my favorite go to for gifts. Don't wait, get it know.<br /><br />A true NY wine lover..."
1575,5,"The Boy who Would Be King is a darling book. The illustrations are beautiful and charming, the story is encouraging and helpful to both parents and children.  If you want to open discussions with you child and encourage positive financial practices, this book will help you do it.  It encourages delaying gratification and saving for long term goals as well as decision making. At the end, are tips for parents to help teach kids about money.  Highly recommend this family book."
1576,4,"I love the gentle way this book flows along, educating and inspiring the reader to dream bigger and to trust the law of attraction to assist in creating the life you really want.<br /><br />I recommend reading one chapter at a time, then pausing to visit the author's website for that chapter's special video (presented by the author herself) before continuing on to the next chapter."
1577,4,"What I really like about this book is its positivity:  unlike the traditional song in which everything becomes lost, broken, or tarnished, this book celebrates the tender evening moments that lead up to bedtime.  Singing this version has become a bedtime routine with my kids (4 & 2), who smile as they anticipate the next phrase, sometimes preferring to sing it to me rather than the other way around.  Part of my childhood was spent in rural southeast Missouri, so as a bonus I can identify with the references to nature and the &#34;country feel&#34; of the illustrations."
1578,5,"The second book in the Addison Holmes series.<br /><br />Liliana Hart has created a fun story with mystery, humour, and romance.  It is fun to see the situations that Addison and her friends find themselves mixed in.<br /><br />I am looking forward to more stories about Addison and her friends and of course more from Liliana Hart."
1579,5,"This book, written by one of the most important scholars in the field of reproductive and evolutionary biology, is a fantastic read.  It is very accessible to folks who have no background in this area as well.  So many things to learn about our bodies, why they work the way they do and what lies in our future.  Great read!"
1580,5,"I am awaiting Asa larsson's next book as I have absolutely loved her first three novels. She is, in my opinion, a better writer than Stig Larsson. However, I am loving the unfussy yet intense story-telling of the scandanavian writers. Asa Larsson is superb in her crafting of the characters, and her writing of the relationship between people and animals is extraordinary."
1581,5,"This is an excellent book about Richmond's history from 1600's-present. It starts with the early settlers, and covers in detail the settlers interaction with the Indians through the Civil War and to the present.  Richmond was a large slave port and slaves were auctioned off in Downtown Richmond.  The implications of this its slave trade are still ongoing.  Despite integration,  Richmond is still healing and active reconciliation is imperative!"
1582,5,"A great read. Fiona's style made me feel I was there with her and Tod on their hair raising trips through the mountains! Funny too, and sad in places. I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in far away parts of the world, or to anyone who just enjoys reading about them!"
1583,5,Very easy to read and provides good detailed instructions and guidelines.  Helps with several projects.  Provides dirctions to complete tasks quickly.
1584,1,"I ordered this thinking it would be exciting and fun to crochet the items out of it.  I am disappointed.  It will be going to a local school and maybe one of the kids will enjoy it.  I love the gorgeous designs but, it just doesn't inspire me to make them.  Save your cash for more yarn."
1585,5,"I found this to be a very interesting book and full of new information about the Civil War, the battles, and the men that fought in it. It is a very thick book but so worth the time it takes to read it. I found so much new interesting facts and how the NC Calvary was formed and personal information about the men who joined the Calvary. It is a readable interesting book but a very detailed book."
1586,5,"I heard the author on a radio talk show and knew I had to get his book. There are several that deal with flying. None are fully comprehensive. I think the perfect adjunct to this book is the latest version of \\""Ask the pilot\\"" Get both."
1587,3,"Not as good as the first one with Father Ananda and Jak. Too many repeated descriptions of the Garden and its sections. Too often reminding the reader of the corruption of civilian authorities, police, and some temple personnel. Hope the third one has the polish and intrigue of the first."
1588,5,nice book for children who are expecting the arrival of a sibling. Mom's love is big enough for everyone and everything!!!
1589,5,This is one that you will underline and review as you go. Not thru  yet but I think I have already read it 3 times. You you will: Thanks Bishop Spong for who you are.  ( And give thanks for their happy marriage.)  Love is to be shared.
1590,1,I was really disappointed in this book and it seemed to only outline case studies and did not provide any real techniques for overcoming self-sabotaging behavior. It seemed more like an advertisement for this ladie's other books or products to me. No real advice given just a few platitudes and encouragement of the &#34;think positive&#34; category. Waste of time in my opinion.
1591,5,"With the centenary of the Great War looming ever rapidly, interest will, and could said to have already, rise extremely quickly, and with it books, documentaries, films etc etc. One issue with the Great War, especially in the UK, is that by and large it is misunderstood, with many myths and even just basic inaccuracies that have been put forward and regurgitated by authors, the media, documentaries and others.<br /><br />What this book does, and very timely too, just in time to reach as wide an audience as possible before the centenary, is describe, simply, the war. Not from any country's individual viewpoint (how many in Britain are aware of what happened on the Eastern Front, or indeed of any part of the Western Front not occupied by the French, who lost more men by the end of 1914 than we lost in the entire war?), or forcing an opinion, but simply putting the facts as to what happened, why it happened, and what the result was, interspersed with first hand accounts put into context and helping to illustrate the author's point or give further information as to what it was like to be on the ground. Many books on the Great War either focus on first hand accounts, or by giving a general overview and just describing units without getting a feel for what it was like to be there - this book manages to weave the two together very well.<br /><br />I cannot highly reccommend this book enough for anyone interested in the war - I have been studying various aspects of the Great War for around six years now, but just several pages into this book I realised just how little of the conflict as a 'World War' I actually knew, and am extremely glad this has come along and re-educated me!"
1592,4,"1863 in the Civil War was a year of turning points, such as the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation, the battle Gettysburg, and the sieges of Vicksburg and Chattanooga. Readers may think that publishers would overwhelm the marketplace with related books, yet it is not so. No other Civil War battlefield park is visited as much as Gettysburg and this year there is only one book that takes up the challenge to comprehensively present the battle. Gettysburg: The Last Invasion meets the challenge. Written in a style that is friendly for general readers, Guelzo's work also meets the standards of scholars.  It is a remarkable achievement.<br /><br />At Gettysburg College, Allen C. Guelzo serves as the Henry R. Luce III Professor of the Civil War Era as Director of the Civil War Era Studies Program, and is the author of 11 books of Lincoln, emancipation, the Civil War and American Christendom. In Gettysburg: The Last Invasion, he sets forth the story in a clear, concise and compelling manner. From the conception of the campaign in the minds of Confederate military leader Robert E. Lee and Confederate Presiden Jefferson Davis through President Lincoln's delivery Gettysburg Address, Guelzo looks at the campaign and battle from several interesting perspectives.<br /><br />Those who are only familiar with Gettysburg because of a school visit or the film Gettysburg will be comfortable with Gettysburg: The Last Invasion.  Guelzo's account is straightforward and does not require extensive familiarity with the battle. Those who have read Noah Trudeau's 2002 Gettysburg: A Testing of Courage or Stephen Sears' 2003 Gettysburg will be delighted by the amount of new information and perspectives in Guelzo's work.<br /><br />One of the enjoyments of Gettysburg: The Last Invasion is the constant attention Guelzo gives to individual combat soldiers, commanders, and civilians. There is rarely a paragraph that does not contain direct remarks from participants. Describing the fighting during the morning and afternoon of July 1, Guelzo offers the testimony of many soldiers and seven civilian witnesses.<br /><br />At the college, student Martin Colver watches an artillery barrage from a third classroom window and is interrupted by a professor leading blue coated signalmen with flags and telescopes to the cupola. The college's president Henry L. Braugher resigns himself to the failure of students to maintain attention during his lecture and dismisses them; soon a cannonball strikes the cupola where the signalmen are.<br /><br />Guelzo offers new and interesting remarks regarding a variety unique circumstances. He describes the non-combat duties performed by Africans Americans in the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. Guelzo estimates the changing fog of war by calculating the time it takes to transmit an order from the division commander to the brigade commander, then to the regimental commander. Confederate troops' discipline included their viewing five executions for desertion after the invaders crossed the Potomac River and enter Maryland.  Looting the dead and wounded occurred during the battle. After a successful attack, enemy corpses with their trouser pockets turned out immediately appeared. While being assisted away from the firing line, mortally wounded North Carolina colonel Henry Burgwyn nearly had his vest pocket watch stolen by a South Carolina lieutenant who is helping him off the field.<br /><br />Overall, the author drives his narrative forward with taut observations of the soldiers. Rebels \\""fell all over themselves with laughter\\"" when they discover that Pennsylvanians believe there are secret handshakes and facial expressions that will spare them the invaders' depravations. Federals soldiers along the roads \\""began to straggle and brigades leaked clots of exhausted soldiers\\"". Federal army commander George Meade remained cordial with corps commander John Reynolds \\""but privately his letters curdle with envy\\"" when Reynolds received a promotion in 1862.<br /><br />Wisely Guelzo does not attempt to definitively answer contentious problems.  Did Confederate cavalry commander J.E.B. Stuart lose the battle by \\""galloping off on a senseless joy-ride\\"" as the invasion began?  Did Confederate corps commander Richard Ewell lose the battle because he lacked the energy and the ruthlessness to drive the Federals off Culp's Hill during the evening of July 1?  The author puts forward his reply to these and other questions. Guelzo believes that both reason and self-interest contend for readers' opinions on these questions. He is not argumentative; he states his case on moves on.<br /><br />The author takes full advantage of a pair of remarkable resources. Gettysburg is the only battle to have its own magazine.  Gettysburg Magazine, founded in July 1989, has published 47 issues of new scholarship on the battle and campaign. In its 24 years, it has offered troves of recently found diaries, reports, and changing interpretations on topics such as African Americans in the Gettysburg campaign, cavalry battles surrounding the main battlefield, the gathering of military intelligence and the farmstead hospitals.  Also, Gettysburg National Military Park regular presents a scholarly seminar and publishs the conference proceedings which Guelzo regularly cites.<br /><br />Both George Gordon Meade's and Robert E. Lee's backers may disagree with Guelzo's conclusions.  He believese that Lee never had a clear grasp of the terrain and the tactics to deal with an enemy and  Meade was reluctant to fight on July 1, 2, and 3. Also, the July 3 cavalry battle, Farnesworth Charge and the advance of the the Pennsylvania Reserves brigade after the Grand Assault are described as they may have been. Guelzo does provide insights into the Virginia clique in the Army of Virginia and to the Peace Democrat generals of the army of the Potomac.<br /><br />Gettysburg: The Last Invasion is enjoyable, not only for its scholarship but also for its storytelling. \\""The sun soon came up, a dim blood-red disc behind the clouds on the eastern horizon\\"" is reminiscent of the best writing in Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage.  Suspense is still found in the familiar story of Gettysburg. \\""So, rather than wait to be hunted by the Yankees . . . Lee would go hunting himself for the climatic victory he had always wanted\\""  writes Guelzo.  Gettysburg: The Last Invasion is indeed a remarkable achievement."
1593,4,This is a very comprehensive guide to the various Lutheran Church worldwide. It is a 630 page volumn that can be very helpful not only to Lutherans but to all Christians interested in this worldwide body. It is a valuable tool for any ecumenist.
1594,5,"This is a classic catalog of the nature of comets from centuries past to 1980's. Great reference for those who write science and science fiction,"
1595,5,"ADHD does not equal stupid, but that message has not yet spread to Tyler's world...especially with the multiple learning challenges heaped on him. Classmates don't understand his exaggerated need to move, teachers misinterpret his behaviors, the principal seems uncertain if he wants Tyler on or off drugs, and any remote possibility of staying focused is demolished with his need to care for his mom and Brandon. If it weren't for Rick, his Civil Air Patrol mentor, Tyler would have no one he could lean on, no hope. Flying is Tyler's absolute dream career. An appointment to the Air Force Academy might not have been out of question, except that finishing high school is. Rick has the kind of connections that can still make Tyler's dreams possible through back doors. Amazing! Tyler's honed skill on a flight simulation/gaming platform can be his ticket to a future career in flight. Playing the game, he can beta test the program and equipment leading to greater skill and efficiency in military drone operations. Great opportunity!<br /><br />Whatever happens, Tyler is bent on staying near Brandon, his brother. He should have noticed before when Brandon was on a downward spiral with heroine. Brandon's addiction has torn apart the family, well, what's left of it, that is. Brandon, his hero. The one who looked out for him, stood up to bullies for him, and went to extremes to read and coach him through every required reading, essay or report  to overcome his many learning challenges. Brandon, who lost a promising internet radio/journalism career, unable to broadcast from rehab.  Once Brandon makes it safely out of rehab, Tyler will never again let him slip into oblivion, never again fail his hero.<br /><br />The author weaves magic by altering voice between Tyler and Ani, aka SlayerGrrl, the three-time International League Gaming champion and designer of the new gaming platform. An ivy-league opportunity fell into Ani's lap as a welcome escape from family dysfunction, with a capital PTSD, and her own possible jail-bird status, but fear ghoulishly continues to peer over her shoulder. Why should she have to choose between getting to know the hottest gamer and a fabulous job and Yale education.<br />Brandon worries, almost incoherently, about the company behind the game. Surely it's just the heroine talking.  Both Tyler's and Ani's futures depend on the game's success and on Rick. But what if there is a sinister agenda? Would the two become guilty of murder? Of treason?<br />Incorporating gaming and programming, Blackhawk helicopters and drones, terrorists and heroes, and military posts in Pakistan and Afghanistan, this book is sure to entice readers of all genres. Offering a little bit of everything to tantalize everyone, this is sure to attract a YA following and, I hope, a demand for sequels.<br />I received this ARC in Kindle format in exchange for my honest review."
1596,4,I just finished the book Zoobreak. It was about three kids who go to find a missing monkey from the zoo named Cleo. Cleo got stolen and the kids find some clues and go on a search to find Cleo. I enjoyed this book. If you like mysteries you would probably like this book.
1597,5,"These are great children's prayer books. I have a few of these, and I read them every night with my little one. The pictures are adorable, too! I highly recommend the entire series"
1598,5,"I loved this book. In our culture where so many no longer walk into our churches, and no longer even see a need for Jesus, this book speaks to us how to reach our family members, friends and neighbors... To love as Jesus did and see others through His eyes. I would highly recommend it."
1599,5,The book arrived in excellent condition. I am a recent convert to the Catholic church and this book is a great adjunct to the catechism book.
1600,1,This item was listed as used but the condition was very poor.  The cover was not attached at all and the pages were in very poor condition.  I would never have the nerve to sell this even for $1.00.  The $5.00 paid for this was way overpriced for the condition it was in.
1601,5,"I used this book last year with my 2nd-grade students. My district does not have a writing curriculum, so I was looking for a resource that was aligned to Common Core. This book is full of great lessons, and even comes with a monthly pacing schedule. I recommended it to several colleagues."
1602,5,"I was in a Physical Therapist Assistant program a while back. Most &#34;massage&#34; books go over the basics, but miss the detailed information that most people need to know in order to give a &#34;proper massage&#34;. This book goes into detail about landmarks, pressure on soft tissue and also has a CD with instructions on how to improve your massage technique. I used this book as a guide to give my husband a massage shortly after exiting the program & he now wants me to always give him a massage based on the information I learned from this book."
1603,5,I utilized the book and training materials I found online for a team training session. It facilitated great discussion on how we can communicate more effectively.
1604,5,"This book is excellent, but also a bit outdated. It stems from 1990. Many newer publications are referring to this book. In my opinion it's best to combine this book with more recent research publications. In the past 10 years an enormous amount of research has been done and several quality monographs have been published online."
1605,5,"My 14 year old daughter read and loved this book, so I decided to read it as well.  I don't often love the same things she does, but this was one book that really touched us both.  It is extremely well-written and a wonderful story of self-discovery and growing up in a turbulent and historically significant period.  I highly recommend it!  I also thought as I was reading it what a great movie it would make."
1606,4,Interesting tid-bits of history to show how far we have fallen because our government chose to inflate our money at our expense!
1607,5,"I have been reading the webcomic &#34;Dreamland Chronicles&#34; for years now and I love it. I was happy to find it published and immediately bought it for my little brother who loves it. As of this review (summer 2013), The Dreamland Chronicles is almost completed and is in the process of being translated into different languages so that children and parents of many regions can enjoy this delightful tale. This is definitely a story you can enjoy with your children (the author writes it with his twin boys in mind who also enjoy reading it) and has many grown up-related references for the parents' enjoyment as well (such as references to things like The Princess Bride). There is plenty of sword play, action, and maybe a kiss or two! It also teaches many good lessons as the child-like main character, Alex, develops and grows throughout the story. I cannot recommend this story enough to everyone I know with children, especially children who are reluctant to read stories without a lot of pictures."
1608,5,"My mother had a giant jar of quarters and three &#34;bored&#34; grandkids, so I ordered some of these collection folders and let them at it.  It was fun for the whole family to sort and see what we could find.  We are still missing some of the quarters, and there isn't a coin that passes through my kids' hands that isn't inspected for the right dates.  The fun continues...."
1609,5,"19 Month old daughter loves this book at bed time.  I think the story ends too quickly, but she doesn't seem to mind."
1610,5,"I've always admired JFK. I was 10 when he was killed and often wondered all that may have led up to it. This book offered a great insight to a great man and the trials of office, personal dedication along with his guiding principles. Very much worth the read."
1611,5,Classic Romance Book about a small empire. A king who fell madly in love with just ordinary girl and willing to sacrifice himself for her.
1612,5,Sorry I did not do the review earlier but wanted to make it up now. I still use the cook book and have had some great meals from it. The book is in great shape and well worth it.
1613,5,"Buying both Compendiums together will get you a great price and also will enable you to have almost the entire series with only two small volumes to buy to complete the entire storeline that is currently out there now. I also watch and love the show on AMC and find it fantastic also but the books are the greater medium because you can just do so much more there than you can on tv, lol.<br />Either way, give the series a shot, it is fantastic!"
1614,3,"He recommends that elderly women should take calcium when infact every dairy product from milk to cheese, any juices like orange juice, soy milk, etc. is fortified with 30% to 35% calcium and most research and studies recommend not to take any calcium supplements after sixty since it is more damaging to human health. I avoid falling into the world of  both conventional medicine as well as alternative medicine since I am very skeptical of both industries and it has done magic for my health. Any pill or treatment regardless from regulated/prescription/conventional or unregulated/supplements/alternative are nothing other than a substitute for what is really needed: weight control, regular exercise which is strength training as primary sport, and a carefully balanced nutritious dietary plan for the long term health and happiness. Diet and exercise, exercise reduces blood pressure, weight and diabetes. If exercise was a pill, you'd  be taking one pill to treat four or five different conditions.<br /><br />In UK, market for vitamins and supplements was estimated to be worth some £385 million last year, up 2.7% compare to the previous year. Big pharma makes billions every time the cholesterol levels are lowered from 220 to 200 and then down to 180. Seven ou t of ten doctors who were on the panel of recommending the lower level of cholesterol were on the big pharma payroll.The most harmful and deadly diseases plaguing America today are caused by food; cheap, low quality processed foods high in sugar, fat, salt, genetically modified ingredients and pesticides. when you reach for whole, nutrient-dense, organic foods, you get a food-remedy tool kit that not only will ward off cancer and heart disease, but also colds, flu, allergies, and a host of other ailments that plague us every day."
1615,5,"good book, great reference, easy to understand. pictures are fantastic, will enjoy this book for many years to come. thanks"
1616,5,It was both depressing and exciting.  So intimate it seemed a biography.  Having been to Korea I knew the places but that was not critical at all.  A great book for anyone interested in Korea and northeast Asia.
1617,3,"I received a copy of this book from Story Cartel for an honest and impartial review.<br /><br />This was a very touching story, even though the story was somewhat predictable. I did enjoy reading the book, for the most part, the characters were fairly believable."
1618,5,Am using it and love the fact that I can see all the instructions with or without glasses.  It is also written in a language that those who are not trained in computers can understand and appy.
1619,4,"One of several Chinese legends with the theme of sacrifice for a cruel emperor.  Meng Jiangnu's husband was conscripted for labor on the Emperor's Great Wall.  Just as thousands of other workers, he died from the excess of heavy labor, and was buried in a section of the wall. Meng goes to find her husband, breaks the wall, and retrieves her husband's bones for a proper burial. The Emperor, seeing her beauty, commands her to marry him, or he will behead her.  After her husband's burial, Meng refuses the Emperor's offer of marriage by jumping into the sea to her death.<br /><br />In classical Chinese legends, the themes of loyalty, honor, and fidelity to marriage are held in highest regard. The Emperor's cruelty and Meng's sacrifice may seem extreme to Western eyes, but this is a pure story of love and honor to the Chinese. In their eyes, it is more sacred to end your own life than to link yourself to an evil person. Good for a 4th or 5th grade discussion! Yang Ming-Yi creates lovely, evocative watercolor-and-ink illustrations that add a dream-like quality to the tale.  Ages 8-12."
1620,5,With a basic understanding of chemistry this book is a great read.  The guide offers a focused look into the cellular level of what our bodies require to be healthy. The elements and molecules and how they interact in our bodies. I have long believed that it is a understanding of chemistry NOT calorie counts that offer real health.  Steve M.
1621,5,"At its heart, The Boys in the Boat is a tale of Everyman. Daniel James Brown teleports readers back to 1930s Seattle, and plunges them into the lives of several University of Washington students whose passion becomes rowing crew. He has a gift for context, showing in incredible detail what it is like to learn to row, the mental and physical costs of being competitive, and the process of sublimating oneself in service to a larger whole.<br /><br />In striking counterpoint to the development of several Western wonder teams is the long-held superiority of Eastern schools. And in broader counterpoint is the chilling contrast between New and Old Worlds, exemplified by the divergent Olympic paths followed by American student-athletes and the Nazi hierarchy, which realizes and capitalizes upon the propagandic potential innate in hosting the 1936 Olympiad.<br /><br />This volume is at once minutely focused on the lives of the young athletes and the grandiose aspirations of Joseph Goebbels, filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl (type Triumph of the Will in any search engine) and Adolf Hitler himself. The first time Brown juxtaposes a Seattle event with a German one, I confess that I wondered how coherent and cohesive the rest of the book could possibly be. In a case of supreme irony, it turns out that a number of 1930s events half a world apart were incredibly ironically juxtaposed, sometimes down to the day.<br /><br />One of the many strengths of this book is its rich detail and context. Endnotes hint at the depth of research and attribution. Extended endnotes, promised online at the author's website after the book's release, should contain even more attribution and supply further interconnectedness.<br /><br />Brown's writing is definitely luminous. Word choice and syntax sparkle, with several key characters presented in careful detail. Even stronger are the visual, auditory and kinesthetic portrayals of moments both large and small.

1622,5,"A fellow climbing recommended this to me about 10 or 12 years ago when I was having recurring some elbow tendonitis issues.  After incorporating this into my climbing training, my elbow problems disappeared.  I still do this when I'm climbing frequently and it keeps problems at bay; before this, any time I'd go on a climbing road trip, by the third day my elbows would be killing me and I would continue to plague me for the rest of the trip, even with complete rest days.  But since then, even if I might be sore on the third day of a trip, I'll be fine after a rest day.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I loaned my copy to a friend and can't get another one easily!  But the workout is simple enough to remember, as another reviewer commented.  One detail he left out: the first 4 exercises are all 4 sets of 8, alternating either between arms (if using dumbells) or between exercises (if using barbells) with no rest between.  I think the remaining exercises were single sets of 10 or 15."
1623,3,"Magic, royalty, romance, and a prophecy, plus a pretty cover is what made me pick me up this book.  But...it was just o.k. for me. Not bad by any means, there were just a few elements that drove me crazy and made me look online to see if there was a book 1...this is it.<br />The Rose Throne is about two different kingdoms, two different kinds of magic, and two very different princesses from either kingdom.  There is a magic called taweyr for the men and neweyr for the women, unweyr for those with no magic and something much more dangerous and powerful for those, the ekhono, who by some \\""mistake\\"" get the opposite gender's magic.  The dangerous part of being ekhono is that the ruler of one of the kingdoms has declared it illegal and will put to death anyone suspected of it.  This ruthless king has thrown the balance of men's and women's magic out of whack by not letting the neweyr flourish and letting his taweyr take over the land.  Ailsbet is the princess of this land and only truly loves music, not ruling, and no one in her land appreciates music like she does.  I didn't really understand this princess; I thought she was cool in the first half of the book, but then in the second half she seemed super selfish, and annoying. I didn't get it...<br />However, in the other land, a much more reasonable king abides with a more enjoyable princess, Issa. I just ended up feeling sorry for her the entire book, but she was a strong and capable character unlike Ailsbet. She's forced to leave her kingdom and agree to a marriage to young boy prince to try and unite the two kingdoms, thus hopefully fulfilling a prophecy. However, chaos (and possibly true love?) then ensues which you will find out if you read the book : )<br />My main problem with this book was the lack of background information. Like the magic isn't ever just explained to you (which I get sometimes you're supposed to show readers things through your writing, but this definitely needed an explanation...I thought I had missed a book).  I wish the kingdoms had a bit more info. too. Like how big are they? Just one town? Islands? I know there's more than just the two main ones so how many others are there.  Stuff like that just made it feel incomplete for me. And it is quite violent in parts which I wasn't expecting.<br />Overall, it was O.K. I'm not mad I spent time reading it.<br />I obtained a copy of this book through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.ad missed a book).  I wish the kingdoms had a bit more info. too.

1626,5,"I misplaced my copy of this book, so I bought another copy when I recently started playing the game again. I hadn't played it for fifteen or twenty years, but I remembered it as one of the best--and my memory served me well in this case! The strategy guide is unsurpassed--a brilliant example of what such a book should be. It's chock full of information not found in the game manual or anywhere else (except maybe, these days, on fan sites online). And it's such a satisfying read that I enjoy poring through the book about as much as I like playing this great old game."
1627,4,"I liked the examples in this book and especially the color schemes that he used.  I think it definitely improved my water color technique, but of course you have to practise.  I did do many of the examples and continue to use it as a reference when I am painting similar scenes as shown in the examples.  I would recommend it to even a beginner water colorist."
1628,5,We came across the video on YouTube. My son fell in love with it and fire trucks after seeing it. When I found out it was a book I was so happy. I was disappointed when I found out the book was no longer in print. When I saw that it was being sold used on Amazon my spirits were lifted but then dropped when I saw the prices it was being sold for. I was lucky and got it for an amazing deal. My son and I read it frequently.

She's just made one little mistake and now she needs Travis McGee to set it right. The money is good and Travis's funds are in need of replenishing. But that's not the only reason he takes the case. There is the movie star's assistant--efficient and reserved, with a sadness underneath that makes McGee feel he'd brave any danger to help her.<br /><br />\\""John D. MacDonald is a shining example for all us in the field. Talk about the best.\\""--Mary Higgins Clark<br /><br />Sultry movie star Lysa Dean has gotten herself into a spot of blackmail, posing for naked photos while participating in a debauched party near Big Sur. If the pictures get out, Lysa's engagement to her rich, strait laced fianc&eacute; doesn't stand a chance. Enter Travis McGee, who's agreed to put a stop to the extortion, working alongside Lysa's assistant, Dana Holtzer.<br /><br /> They begin by tracking down everyone associated with the lurid evening, and soon enough they're led on a chase across the nation as murder after murder piles up. Further complicating matters, Travis and Dana's relationship soon turns steamy. And just when he thinks he knows exactly where things are headed, one big twist shakes McGee's life to the very foundation.<br /><br />Well, I'm continuing my McGee journey month by month. This was the fourth instalment in the twenty-one book series which MacDonald wrote and had published between 1964 and 1985. Incidentally, the first four were all published in 1964. I don't believe that would happen today.<br /><br />McGee is engaged by Lysa Dean, Hollywood hot property to get her out of a jam. After indulging in a sexual free-for-all with some guests on a break a year or so ago, she's being blackmailed with photographic evidence of the shenanigans.

He strikes me as a deeply moral person. He has his own code to follow - a short-haired hippy, minus the predilection for meaningless sex and drug abuse.

1630,1,"The potential was there, but sadly the author has no real concept of what people were really like in the 1940s. The speech, thoughts and attitudes of the characters were from this era, while the setting was from a very different time. Historical fiction is not just about a time. If the characters are not in keeping with the period,you may as well call it science fiction."
1631,5,"The bible is so translated that it is rendered useless to me, as well as religion. This book resonates so much to me because it shows how Jesus is the greatest teacher mankind ever had. No negativity, no fear, just unconditional love for us. I no longer have any religious propaganda or politics in my life, but instead I carry His Divine love in my heart always. Love has no boundaries.This book reinforces this."
1632,5,"I like that he was able to share his own story before he passed. I was not able to hear it personally, but was able to get that through this book. Thanks"
1633,5,I heard a review of this book by the author and just new I wanted to read it. Very enlightening
1634,5,"\\""There are known-knowns. These are the things we know that we know. There are known-unknowns, which are the things we know that we don't know. There are also unknown-unknowns -- these are the things we don't know that we don't know\\"".<br /><br />This book reveals to you the things you do not know that you don't know. There is a whole side to living of which humanity is unaware. For those who have always asked \\""what is my purpose?\\"", this book reveals the answer.<br /><br />Do not be put off by the negative review posted elsewhere by another reader. I do not know what the person who gave this book a negative review was thinking. The book is not difficult to read at all. Anyone with a high-school education can read and understand this book. The subject matter is so fascinating that you will glide through it almost non-stop.<br /><br />For thoe who are truly Seeking, this is what you have been searching for."
1635,5,A great insight into what was one of the greatest restaurant kitchens.  Lisa Abend's writing style made the book easy to read and interesting.
1636,5,This is a great book.  I couldn't put it down.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy.
1637,5,"There are \\""characters\\"" in every small town (perhaps even your town) that exist just below the surface of normal.  Based on their facial expressions, mannerisms, idiosyncrasies, actions, and words, they are the ones people describe as quirky, bizarre, crazy, evil, and to the extreme ~ mad.  Take a look around you!  You can see the exterior but you never know what's in their hearts and minds.  Things are not always what they seem.  There is a fine line between perception, truth, and reality.<br /><br />The authors' descriptions of characters create images you will not soon forget!  Each is a colorful piece of the puzzle that is MR. BUILD.  These characters are reminiscent of those created by the master of horror, Stephen King.  A love story runs throughout, just below that surface of normal.  The attempted consummation is romantic and erotic, rivaling the pleasures of the red room in E. L. James' FIFTY SHADES OF GREY.<br /><br />Read the book, enjoy, put those puzzle pieces together, sit back, and say, \\""Wow\\""!"
1638,4,my wife purchased this book because it was required by the grad class she is taking.  she tells me it is a great book!
1639,5,"Outstanding, ordered many copies for friends. Currently reading for the third time.  Recommend to anyone who would  enjoy learning about a soul friend."
1640,5,The book is old but the lessons will never expire. What a gifted artist. This book was very helpful when I was planning on a special project.
1641,4,"A cross between Harry Dresden and Kate Daniels. I like it. Nice little twists and good story line. Different. Will buy next one gladly. Get it, worth the cash."
1642,5,This is a wonderful book on grasses.It has information on all types. These are not grasses that you mow but ornamental grasses. The only minus is the fact they do not picture all the grasses they list.
1643,5,"This book was such a blessing to me. With so many thought provoking stories, it will make you look at your life and were you are and how you chose to handle real life situations. For me when I read the stories I saw so much of myself in these stories, and she provided biblical principals and gave great insight on how God said life situations should be handled."
1644,5,"Having ready Amity Shlae's Forgotten Man and Coolidge, I realize how little we really learned about what happened in the 20's and 30's in school.  Text books have white washed the history of this period to fit the liberal-progressive narrative.  Ms. Shlaes has done a great job of illustrating in detail the political and economic impact of the errant policies and progressive economic experimentation under the fabled &#34;New Deal&#34;.  While FDR didn't cause the Crash of 1929, his poor policies caused a normal cyclical recession to continue unnecessarily for 10-years scarring a generation of &#34;forgotten men&#34; and setting the stage for the systematic erosion of our Constitution that continues today under FDR-copycat Obama.  It's a great book with a well research and very readable style - a must read."
1645,2,"I thought the novel had no real sense of reality; although the author tried to report historical events from an observer's point of view. I grew up in the years during which World War II took place. I remember the vile antics of Herr Hitler all too well. I have visited the home of Anne Frank. I have toured the Jewish Museum in Washington, DC.  And, though not myself of the Jewish faith, I have mourned the loss of the many innocent people whose only &#34;fault&#34; was that they were Jewish. Hitler wanted to turn the world into his own  version of white, German supremacy. Although &#34;Life after Life&#34; follows the historical war in Europe, trying to picture a person or a family through different stages of the War, the author's use of the various deaths of one person was, to me, unrealistic and annoying. Once I start reading a novel, no matter how &#34;good&#34; or &#34;not-so-good&#34;, I read it to the end. Unfortunately, I could hardly wait to get to the last page of this novel."
1646,5,"Read the first one as a recommendation from my daughter's kindergarten teacher and now she wants the set for her birthday! No uncomfortable topics, behaviors, or words to have to explain in the story. Good self-confidence lessons."
1647,5,"So many try to prove what Islam and Christianity have in common, but let's face it, the differences are far bigger and more important.<br />Christianity: 1 God in 3 persons. Father, Son, Holy Spirit.<br />Islam: 1 Allah in no persons, as personality would be limiting.<br />Christianity: God always keeps His word.<br />Islam: Keeping his word limits him, so Allah  can keep it or not.<br />Christianity: God wants to save everyone from sin, and evil, even dieing as Jesus and resurrecting to try and save them. Jesus, God incarnate, saves all who come to Him.<br />Islam: Allah won't lift a finger to save humans. Just because he claims to be merciful doesn't mean he ever has to prove it by actually showing any mercy. Everyone will go to Hell, and then be let out a few at a time when Mohammad begs nicely. You wanna be saved, save yourself by being good enough that when Mohammad begs for the good enough to be released you get released. No Christian will ever be released from Hell. Jesus is a 2nd rate prophet whose title `Messiah' is a meaningless word.<br />Christianity: God proves He is omniscient by foreseeing the future perfectly and giving prophecy to prophets.  If it does not come true in any way, he is a false prophet, so stone the fake.<br />Islam: Allah proves he is all powerful and all knowing by giving Mohammad new verses to replace any that Allah foresaw wrong, or replace doctrines that bombed. Replaced verses can still be used as a smokescreen to fool fools, but Muslims must follow the new verses or doctrines.<br />Christianity: God gave the law to Moses. Murder, rape, theft, lying, etc. are sins.<br />Islam: God gave a tablet to Moses with something or other on it, but who cares what it said? Murder, rape, theft, lying, etc. done to non-Muslims is good, and encouraged.<br />Christianity: Marriage is between 1 man and 1 woman.<br />Islam: Not only polygamy and child brides, but sex slaves, with prostitution replaced by half hour marriage and divorce for money.<br />Christianity: Seek common ground to try and get along.<br />Islam: Drop 100% of Christianity and accept 100% of Islam, or else choose between slavery or death."
1648,5,"This book was super interesting because it is a real-life adventure and because I have been to the Yucatan 4 times so far and have actually been to quite a few of the places that he talks about in the book- so it was really cool to learn more history behind them and to see how much the Yucatan has changed in the past 150 years. I loved how Cosimo put the 2 volumes together and included Frederick Catherwood's art. I actually just bought &#34;Incidents of Travel in South America, Chiapas, and Yucatan&#34; and I can't wait to start reading that next."
1649,5,"Although much of what is in this book can be found in other sources, the author has included information not found in other sources. I highly recommend it to any Moffat Road fan."
1650,5,"MUST BUY!CERTAIN BUSINESS BOOKS ARE A MUST BUY! GREAT OUTLINE, EASY TO FOLLOW. THIS BOOK IS GREAT FOR FUTURE BUSINESS OWNERS! BE A BOSS!"
1651,5,"I heard of Gregg's book on the Rachael Raye show.  I heard that all profits go to charity for the abused.  This is the 1st and only book I have ever bought new, just for that reason.  My children (3) and myself have all suffered abuse,  physical and/or emotional through out our lives.  At the hands or mouths of those that we should have been able to trust.  There is just nothing that can be said.  I am so glad he is one of the selected few, for whatever reason, to have gotten thru all of this and be successful.  It appauls me that the US helps out any other Country via it be weather related or poverty.  I SAY, WE NEED AS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, BE SURE OUR OWN IS OK AND TAKEN CARE OF, WHETHER IT BE STARVATION, ABUSE OR HEALTH INSURANCE......we must take care of our own before we worry about other countries.  The waste of money is disgusting between the government and those in Hollywood, who want what they want when they want it is so selfish and quite frankly embarrassing to me.  Let them help and give to those that need it, without cameras or a pat on the back.  Do we see any of the countries that we have \\""helped\\"" come over to the US when we need help?????Never have I ever heard of any country coming here after any of our School shootings, tornadoes, hurricanes or anything else.  Bottom line, if I could help one child who needs it, I would.  Gregg, God bless you and know you are an inspiration to so many i'm sure, but for me, it home hard and I respect you so much.  You broke the cycle for your family and that is worth so much, how lucky your son is.  And the respect I feel towards all of those that helped you and believed in you, words can not explain.<br /><br />Just me who understands!!!"
1652,3,"I was pretty upset at first for receiving volume 11, which I already have, instead of volume 4. I contacted customer service and got in touch with the seller, and the service was very prompt and courteous. Getting an advanced refund, and will return product, and buy the right book. The error here was a bar code sticker volume 4 placed on a volume 11 book. the book was in very good condition, as described, just not the right one. I give it 3 stars, because 4 stars means I liked it, and I obviously did not like the mistake."
1653,4,"If you like I Love You Through and Through this is another good one. We bought The More We get Together as well, but I wasn't impressed with that one."
1654,5,a lot of great information and helped me learn a lot about sales being fun and not a pain in the butt!
1655,4,"I really like the way the book covers a lot of ground in an organized fashion. I did not like the way examples are thrown around without much consideration to actual use cases. Let's be upfront about it: You'll probably never write a class called SupernaturalPerson, so it may take you a little bit more thinking to come up with your own example and then connect it to the concepts being taught. There are examples of this all over the book. I'll probably never need to create a PDF file that demonstrates where things can be positioned, but I may need to create some letterhead. If I try to adapt the &#34;positioning things&#34; demo to the letterhead project, I may quickly realize there are little things that would have been really helpful to have printed in the book. So examples, appropriate examples, count for a lot.<br /><br />With all that said, good book for people who are trying to solidify their PHP knowledge. Kind of bathroom-reference material more than &#34;give you new ideas about cool stuff you can do&#34; material."
1656,5,"No spoilers.<br /><br />I felt Charlaine Harris remained true to the series and Sookie and felt the ending was pretty much the only way it could have ended.  I have read every book multiple times and listened to them on on audiobook  many, many times.<br /><br />What I think people need to keep in mind is that this is a urban fantasy series not a paranormal romance.  One of things I have enjoyed the most is the reoccurring secondary characters which has made Sookie's world much richer for me.  For True Blood lovers who started with the show first, you can not compare the two.  They are so loosely connected that they are really two separate entities, so don't read the books expecting the same, then complain about the differences.<br /><br />I was not thrilled with the prologue and think the elements it provides could have been written into the story another way, but it was short, provided needed info and Harris wanted to do something different.  So what? Why say it was written by someone else?!?<br /><br />I enjoyed the story and getting caught up with all the characters, many of whom are given a sort of \\""ending\\"" to their mini stories.  For those not happy with Sookie's and the other endings, really, did you expect Harris to write several pages of Jason and Michelle married, had 4 children, 2 boys and 2 girls, one named Sookie.  Jason continued to work for the township and they died peacefully at 75.  Jane Bodehouse continued to live with her son and drink at Merlotte's until dying of cirrhosis at 60.?  Sookie's story goes on, Harris will just not be writing it but she did provide some type of closure ensuring that Bon Temps and it's people go on.<br /><br />As for what happens to Sookie in the end, if you've read every book and have listened to what she said (and is repeated so clearly in this book), it was the only true to Sookie possible ending.  So you loved this character, or that character and this one did that, blah, blah, blah and Sookie was so blah, blah, blah.  They are written like real people with FLAWS.  Sookie stayed true to herself with her choices, no matter how some of the haters wanted her to choose someone else.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book for the reason I've enjoyed all the rest in the series:  a great cast of flawed characters, a little action and a human heroine who isn't really an a$$kicker, but rises to the occasion to save the ones she cares about."
1657,5,"I must confess, when reading the intro of Setting Sun, I almost panicked that I had picked up a political polemic disguised as an academic piece.<br /><br />Happily my fears were unfounded, true Adams' introduction is somewhat terse, fiery and opinionated, however the overall book is well researched, balanced and insightful.<br /><br />Typically when reading information dense material, I find myself restricted to only absorbing a chapter (or even a page) per day, lest my brain explodes. While I won't be able to complete any pop-quizzes I found myself devouring Setting Sun in a couple of nights.<br /><br />Much of the book is based on short to medium term historical trends in economics, although Adams dabbles in a while sociology (not enough to offend though!) and overall is very bleak, albeit accurate.<br /><br />What amazed me the most about this book, is that despite sometimes strong points of view, on potentially controversial subjects I never felt the author was shallowly pushing their own agenda at the cost of accuracy. As a typically left-leaning person, I learnt mass amounts both for and against my current views.<br /><br />I recommend this book for people who can take it. I'm assuming that those who can't handle the truth about the economic situation are not the best audience for this book, but anyone interested in genuine wisdom should check this out. Please note that this book is about the END of dominance for the US, so don't expect much material on solutions."
1658,5,"This is a book to help groups of single men, including aspects of development and questions for group discussion. Buy it if you are in a group."
1659,2,"Disappointed, I thought I would, but just don't like most of the recipes.<br />I would only make a couple if the vegetarian ones.  Bit if a waste on my behalf."
1660,5,i like this book. it was mailed quickly and received in great condtion. I have already began to use the patterns. thank you
1661,2,"I just couldn't connect with the characters of this book.  Not a challenge to read.  A governess to her children, main character was pushed into being a part of a dinner party.  Could she pull it off?"
1662,5,A great read for music lovers. Very surprised at Keith's reading list. I see home in a different light now.
1663,5,"This is the most informative  and, useful book I've ever seen. The troubleshooting format is easy to follow. It guides step by step to eliminate the most common and some &#34;not so common&#34; pc problems.Covers any and all pcs even Mac. I would recommend this book for novices and pros alike!"
1664,4,High Society & Low Life has a number of very nice full color maps.  The maps are two sided. One with a key and one without.  There is also a booklet with several adventure ideas to use on each map.  Nice for a quick thrown together night of Shadowrun.
1665,5,"This volume collects issues 1-6 of David Lapham's Age of Apocalypse series...a spin-off from Rick Remender's Uncanny X-Force.<br /><br />This collection surprised me in many ways. One, it's not about mutants per se...the heroes are all humans...a few of the last remaining humans still alive in a future, post-apocalyptic Earth where mutants rule supreme and billions of humans have been exterminated for the higher evolutionary good. So at first I was not really thinking I'd find this interesting...I'm an X-Man fiend after all. I need my heroes shooting fire out of their eyeballs and acids out of their nipples and what not. But that's how brilliant this book is...even though it's not about mutants it PERFECTLY captures the desperation of covert warfare, the fear of being the last ones alive, etc etc. The dialogue is on par with The Wire. It's that good. I want to cry when I think that Lapham will never write one of the main X-Men books while HACKS like Bendis and Hickman can do whatever they want.<br /><br />The art is gorgeous. It's mature, complicated, filled with really, really cool details up and down the pages. It doesn't show women with gigantic boobs and men with biceps bigger than children...it just realistically depicts this blasted, rubble-filled world where green-skinned mutant prostitutes haggle with invisible mutant johns in the streets and Quentin Quire is a street magician building his own hive mind, telepath by telepath.<br /><br />This series is absolutely brilliant and of course it was cancelled way too soon. Do yourself a favor and pick it up and find out just how good comic books can be when REAL talent writes them."
1666,5,"I saw the movie first since my favorite supermodel &#34;Liya&#34; played the lead...she did an amazing job, which is what compelled me to buy this novel in the first place. A real eye opener and to know this is a real account of the author's life makes it even more fascinating..."
1667,5,"This book has given me new direction, focus, and hope. This book has transformed my life and my soul piurpose for esxisting on earth. If you have not read this book you. should. So glad it can into my life."
1668,5,I bought this as a gift for a relative that is of Finnish heritage from the UP. She said that this book is excellent.<br /><br />It is written for someone interested in a detailed account of the local history. It actually goes into detail about specific families. It's not for casual reading; I would describe it as a book for research.
1669,1,My wife likes to do these searches but she has had a stroke and doesn't see real well.  The small letters make it hard for her to read the letters.  It you have great eyesite it would be a good book. If not I don't recommend it.
1670,5,I came across a card advertising the 299 Days series after purchasing from Special Operations Equipment (SOE). I read some other reviews and looked at the website before making the purchase. This book series is worth the read. Every person should read these books. After finishing this book I told my wife about it. She was skeptical but decided to give it a shot. Like me she could not put the book down. It is easy to read and eye opening to future possibilities. HIGHLY recommended.
1671,4,"The book is a lot larger than I expected but I guess that's to be expected since it is very complete and covers all aspects and anything you would need for the A+ exam.<br /><br />Plenty of pictures, which is one of the reasons the book is so big, for people that have never seen or encountered some of the older hardware that isn't as common nowadays, like serial ports, ISA slots, older types of ram, etc.<br /><br />The pictures are all black and white but they are very clear. Would be better if they were in color but then book would be very expensive!"
1672,5,"i've read the book. i like the series. this title was not put into paperback, thus it's difficult to find. you had it, i wanted it. end of story!"
1673,5,"Grandchild loved the book, as he loves pre historic animals, so I will be looking for more books along this line..."
1674,4,"alot of people stop and Enders game, but i think they are missing out on the journey. This is a great book if you love Ender, its not like the first book at all so dont expect that but it's a great book."
1675,4,"On the positive side, I found the unique structure of this novel very interesting.  I found the portrayal of a therapist with limited insight into his own choices and clinical practices interesting.  Clearly, therapists are human, and as such are makers of mistakes large and small.  On the negative side, it was disappointing that the protagonist was such a bad psychologist, failing in various areas of his life to an extent that was troubling and lessened my enjoyment of the novel."
1676,5,Very thought out book. Helps understand God's call in all of our lives.  I have needed to read a book like this.
1677,5,These books are great they come with the CD which have piano tracks with or without violin so when you are ready to try the pieces without a net you you can play with just the piano. Excellent I wish there was more ABC books with different pieces but same format.
1678,4,This was for my granddaughter.  She liked it.  I have purchased most of dr. Zeus books.  They have meaning for adults too.
1679,5,"I enjoyed the book; good read, over all. A bit dated, but I expected that. Not as good as One Second After, but again, it was the time in which they were written that made the difference."
1680,5,I love nearly everything in this magazine. Beautifully done. But I wish I could read Russian. The Cyril Alphabet I can deal with but....
1681,5,I read the book and then gave the book to my Chief.  He is now ordering the book for the entire department.  A few of the Officers felt that it was definately worth the read.
1682,4,i choose this rate because they are for my grandaughter and she will love them good shape the book thank you
1683,5,"Oh Wow, this book was actually really cool.  The author is very knowledgeable about the underlying workings of sales and manipulation techniques used by politicians and media personalities.<br /><br />Read this text and never be worried about being brainwashed by the radio again.<br /><br />Read this text and become aware, alert and awake and even a little more dangerous.<br /><br />It's a page turner."
1684,3,"I brought this book with the idea of using it as a lesson for my preschool class. While it's a nice book to add to your collection if your child is into counting bears in general. It is not a book to do lessons off of like some of the other reviews might suggests unless the child can fully read and even then it's pretty simple. I think I will bring it home and add it to my 16 month old daughter's book collection instead. That way she can do this with me when she is old enough to not put the bears in her mouth.<br /><br />In this book they will cover very quickly 4 colors (the colors of most counting bear sets), 3 shapes, and counting to 12.<br /><br />I brought this book via amazon used and I was sent the Scholastic version of this book. I do not know if they are different or not, usually not.<br /><br />I do believe at least one of the reviews has the second book \\""Teddy Bear Math\\"" and not this \\""Teddy Bear Counting\\"" just because I do not have some of the things in this book they were talking about at all. If you have a child that is under around 2 1/2 year old I would get this book. It is a cute little book to read to them. If they are older I would get the other version there is a lot more to that book.<br /><br />Just know both books are more stories to read than lessons to teach."
1685,5,"Beginning in France 29,000 years ago, \\""Interrupt\\"" explores the notion that Neanderthals are still among us.  The real-world hard fact is that modern humans know very little about the species of humans we call Neanderthal.  The electromagnetic climate of Planet Earth is another dark area of human knowledge.<br />Fast forward 29,000 years to Los Angeles and \\""computational biologist\\"" Emily Flint is having a very bad day.  Running late.  Fender bender.  Second and third thoughts about her upcoming wedding.  Squabbles with her boss over a prenatal vaccine versus treatment of existing conditions.  Emily's sister Laura and autistic nephew P.J. are introduced as solar flares shut down the world.<br />Moving to Northern California Marcus Wolsinger makes discoveries of a different and horrifying sort: Earth's sun was unusually `stable' for the past 4000 years, but other G-class stars exhibit frequent solar flare activities that would have sterilized any planet orbiting those stars.  And Earth's sun is beginning to act up.<br />Across the globe in the South China Sea Lieutenant Commander Drew Haldane is investigating a Chinese electromagnetic pulse weapon (EMP) from an F-18 based on the aircraft carrier America.<br />\\""Interrupt\\"" takes the reader on a trip through a collapsing world.  I have a difficult time willingly suspending disbelief, yet Jeff Carlson was kind to my fragile ego.  I enjoyed the speculations on astrophysics, global climate, mental health, biology, archeology, and even military special operations.  If I were a member of a science fiction club, \\""Interrupt\\"" would fuel many active discussions.<br />The Amazon Vine program provided an advanced reader's copy.  \\""Interrupt\\"" will be published in July 2013.  It's worth the wait."
1686,5,"As someone who is concerned by sub-standard ships and poor shipping practices, I applaud any work that addresses the critical issues of marine pollution and damage. Accidental oil and chemical spills and operational discharge, the transfer of invasive alien species (ballast water and on ship hulls),the release of biocides (toxic chemicals used in antifouling paints), the dumping of garbage and sewage, air pollution (sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and carbon dioxide emissions), and so on are very real problems in our world. This book is an excellent - and thorough - introduction to the topic, and I recommend it."
1687,5,i  missed the sidney ooks until tilly. b  came along.  i am enjoying this book... it is holding my attention with a few twists and turns that i did not xpect !!!...  i am only on page 100 but i can feel the tension mounting !!....  love a good book where i am quickly into the story and feel  that i cannot wait to turn the page !!!  good book !!
1688,5,"Interesting book!  If you are interested about medicine or are a pre-medical student, you would probably like this fascinating book!"
1689,4,Not quite as informative as expected...but enjoyed it &#34;your cabin in the woods&#34; book..using these words to total required 14.
1690,5,"Haven't had a chance to put the book to the test so to speak, but it was recommended to me by someone who raises and shows her birds, like at public gatherings and such. My wife is really into all this - she has had chickens before - so I got the book for her as one of her birthday presents. The book is well laid out and has a bunch of plans for coops, which is where I enter the fray. I'll be building everything. Cock-a-doodle-honey-doo!"
1691,5,An interesting story about life during the civil war and those that were wanting no part of it.  It tells of the hardships that were forced on people and they had little choice in the matter.  It was almost as if I knew some of these people!
1692,5,"This book significantly helped me get through my college history class. I recommend purchasing this book if you have a U.S. history class, I could work for college or high school classes."
1693,2,Same formula but in Miami which may make it attractive to floridians. Not that he does not capture Miami but the characters are boring and the ploy silly.
1694,5,"Highly recommend this book, and it may appeal to both fans and detractors of Reagan for different reasons.<br /><br />Ordered \\""Dutch\\"" after seeing a PBS documentary about Reagan in which Morris was prominently featured.  Morris was selected by Reagan, probably more Nancy the \\""Dutch\\"", to be the official historian after Reagan read his biography of Teddy Roosevelt, \\""the Rise of Theodore Roosevelt\\"".  Morris was given extensive access to both Reagan and the White House including traveling to the Geneva and Reykjavík summits with Gorbachev.<br /><br />Morris creates a mythical \\""composite\\"" character born in Chicago who crosses paths with Reagan, first in Dixon, then Eureka College and then as a writer in Hollywood, as they grow up through the same period.  He then writes the biography as a first person memoir of the \\""composite's\\"" life recollections of Reagan.  Somewhere between Governor and President the point of view switches from \\""composite\\"" to Morris; though I am not exactly sure when.  The work is primarily chronological with some occasional jumps, so the transition is murky.<br /><br />The \\""composite\\"" detests Reagan, but you are left to decide if it is driven by philosophy or envy; the slightly nerdy kid with a limp that detests the beautiful people for whom life seems so easy.  In this guise he employs all the usual clichés of Reagan the \\""airhead\\"", Reagan the \\""vacuous actor\\"" lost without a script, Reagan the heartless of \\""trickle down\\"" economics.  It culminates with the \\""composite's\\"" son, who joins the SDS to fight Reagan as governor of California, disappearing forever after the riots at Berkley.<br /><br />Some reviews I have read criticize this as a series of unsupported \\""cheap shots\\"", I think it was intended more to provide some perspective on those who opposed him at the time, and how controversial Reagan was.  We see Reagan, as a part of generation raised on FDR and New Deal, becoming disenchanted with big government.  He left the Democratic Party and took the Reagan democrats with him.<br /><br />Morris in contrast, fighting to remain objective, finds himself drawn to the magnetic power of a truly great man who uses his extraordinary talents, including a photographic memory, to fulfill his destiny.  The two primary foils he is pitted against are Tip O'Neil and Mikhail Gorbachev, both of whom Reagan defeats, one with an economic policy that turns around the nation , the other with SDI that wins the Cold War.<br /><br />However, Morris does not fawn over Reagan and deals with both Iran Contra and his physical deterioration in the second term, primarily his loss of hearing and battle with cancer.  Perhaps his most interesting metaphor is Reagan as a glacier.  An unstoppable force that uses people, with the exception of Nancy, like a glacier uses rocks in its path.  They grind the path forward until they are discarded into the moraine while the glacier moves inexorably on.<br /><br />Enjoy!"
1695,5,"I really enjoyed this book, It started off a little slow for me but I loved it. The book arrived on on time and in perfect condition. I love the poster that came with the book. ^.^ I'm really happy I purchased this book."
1696,2,"I picked this book up from the Ali Al Salem airbase MWR swap rack on the strength of opening it to a random page and liking the style.  I'm a fan of picaresque period pieces, the modern archetype of which is probably Stephenson's Baroque Cycle, and this reminded me of it.  From me, that's a strong compliment.  It's very grim and dark, with incredibly imaginative profanity in essentially every line spoken by the characters.  (I think I'm going to adopt \\""plaguebitch\\"" as my own.)  Two of the three protagonists are about as bad as they could be and still be anti-heroes rather than villains, and one of them probably actually crosses that line.  The third- the woman- is a bit more sympathetic, but still maims and cripples innocent people when needs be.  All of this I rather liked.  After all the setting- the low countries in the early 15th century- isn't exactly a love fest.<br /><br />I'll leave plot description to the other reviews, but since I'm the lowest-rating reviewer thus far I need to expound upon two points, though both are immense spoilers:<br /><br />The first has nothing to do with my rating, but I think that prospective readers of more delicate dispositions might need to be warned: this book very nearly qualifies as a work of LGBT erotic fiction, with a BSDM angle to boot.  I admit that I was caught off-guard by this.  On the first page it's clear that one protagonist has some erotic asphyxiation issues to work out- being aroused at the prospect of his own hanging- but I hadn't expected the graphic and brutal gay sex scenes that pop up later.  (Including having a 15-year-old girl pressured into watching.)  Since reading this book I've read some other reviews that laud this work as one of very few with gay central characters, which is true enough.  But just as I'd warn readers of books with other graphic scenes, I'd like to lodge a similar warning about this work, especially since many readers with closeted (or not) homophobic tendencies will find it extremely distressing.  It ain't subtle at all, and even being minimally homophobic myself it gave me some insights that I really didn't want.  But, whatever- widening my horizons and all that...<br /><br />The second point REALLY annoys me, though.  Throughout the book it seems to be a piece of period fiction set, as I mentioned, in 15th century Holland.  Also as I mentioned it is very picaresque, but there appear to be no supernatural forces at work.  There are some very psychedelic scenes, yes, but these are presented as fever-dreams or episodes of madness, which I grok.  Then, out of the blue, there is a resurrection that throws the whole plot into disarray and which is never explained.<br /><br />This is not an interesting plot twist.  Rather, it is totally random.  Frankly, it comes across as an immense plot cop-out.  In the forward and afterward it is mentioned that the author has a particular interest in folk tales, particularly from Holland, and that these play a part in the book.  But he's writing in English and I for one have no idea if there is some Dutch folk tale that might explain this if I only knew of it.  If so then he was being too subtle for me, and I'm quite cosmopolitan.  Granted, the Baroque Cycle also ends on a supernatural note, but at least in that work you had some hints from the beginning that there was an immortal wandering around.<br /><br />Anyway, up until that point I was enjoying the book IMMENSELY.  It does end on a note that might indicate that a sequel will follow.  If so, I'll read it if only to see if this ridiculousness is explained, and then I might update my review.  But as is the randomness just puts me off, and is why I axed off three stars."
1697,5,"I've gone thru this book, ordered more and given many away. This is a great book to help your perspective on the pains of life. This is a must read for everyone."
1698,5,"This is the second teen book I've read that was written and illustrated like a scrapbook.  The first one was [[ASIN:0545106052 Countdown]].  I think these scrapbook novels are terrific.  They not only teach history in a fun way to the young, but also bring back memories to the old.  While this book was way before my time, it still made me feel nostalgic for the years of writing letters as a teenager, and being so happy when a reply arrived in the mail.  It also reminded me how those letters were often saved, and could be brought out decades later.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the letter writing years covered in this book are not exactly happy ones for either Louise and Dottie, the two teenage girls in the book.  This is especially true of Dottie, who is sent to an internment camp before she started high school.  The girls faithfully write each other, however, and the book shows what an important role letter writing played before the internet.  The only thing I think that will possibly disappoint readers of the book, especially the young, is that there is no freedom for Dottie at the end of the story, as well as no epilogue.  The reader does not find out when she was finally freed, or what both girls were thinking and feeling at the end of the war."
1699,5,"The books were all very good, excellent read. I received the books in the mail extremely fast for regular shipping. Cant complain about much, except that theres no more books to read!"
1700,5,"My Granddaughter was loaned the &#34;Moonbeams&#34; book.  When I got on Amazon to order that book, &#34;Skylights&#34; was offered as a similar sort of book.  I am very glad we ordered it as well.  The condition of the book is very good and it was put in the mail quickly."
1701,5,"for them as what love the city, this fine history makes it clear that new orleans has been new orleans from the beginning.  teh city started corrupt and uncouth, and matured in teh same form. music and dancing and theft and corruption were its birth and development.  its a great book about a great city. laissez..."
1702,5,"I used to injure myself with my running technique.  Years of attempting the Pose has helped me to run injury free.  I am now trying to swim and bike without injury as well and feel confident that Dr. Romanov's techniques will help me to do so, once I master them.  The book is clearly written and provides the mantras necessary to remind oneself of how to run, bike, and swim in the Pose manner."
1703,4,These groups of books are great for the beginner & the fact that all the illustrations are in color - it makes a great comparison to what you see on the screen.
1704,1,"I think I'm one of the few readers who didn't know any of the fishermen involved which explains all their glowing reviews.  Other than cleansing her soul about a lost 15 minutes I'm not sure what the authors intent was other than disparage a USCG who must conduct an array of missions not just once but everyday.  I think there's plenty of blame to go around as it seems that there were alot of folks present who took no action whatsoever.<br />This book suffered from several things.  First; as in any investigation there should have been photos and diagrams.  What does a tuna boat look like?  On the inside?  How are lights displayed on a tug towing a barge?  Diagram how the trapped men were positioned in an air pocket.  How would stabilizing slings been positioned? Simple file photos of a USCG 44 and 41 footer etc... The 1 map and inset were weak at best.  A time line showing the various actions would have been helpful as would a 1 page list of the various vessels and their crew. Two; What seemed to be verbatem transcripts of radio transmissions and courtroom testimony were sometimes confusing and did not enhance the story.  While I agree that the on-scene commander could have displayed (alot) more initative you must remember that virtually every procedure and precaution in the manuals has been written in the blood of dead or injured rescuers, bystanders, good samitarians and victims.  And while commercial salvagers / divers fill a role not every community has a Mike Goodridge... so then what?  One last thought- If there were no Coast Guard we'd have to invent one.... and it would look pretty much like the one we have."
1705,5,"This volume holds everything you would expect from a Cambridge green and yellow: great, extensive introduction that talks a lot about the problems surrounding the text without taking any strong positions, followed by an updated text and an extensive set of endnotes. Hunter has a way of referring to rather unexpected works of literature when making ancient/modern comparisons. This isn't really a negative, but they just flew over my head."
1706,5,"I got this book for my husband.  He watches as much Bear Grylls as possible.... He read it in two days, which means he couldn't put it down. I don't know what its about but if your man likes to read and he likes Bear, then this is definitely a gift idea for him.  Thanks Bear!!"
1707,5,I ordered this book a few months ago and I still have not received it. I called the publisher and they said it in stock. Can someone at Amazon figure out what the problem is. This book is a great book for woman who need to learn the laws of Jewish Family Purity! I highly recommend it!
1708,5,My interest in origami began with Sudako and One Thousand Cranes. This is a great addition to my library of origami patterns.
1709,5,"We have four rescued terriers, so my husband and I knew that we needed to prepare our home and our dogs before the baby was born. This book helped so much! I am happy to report that our dogs made the transition from being fur-children to fur-siblings with no issues, and they have a great relationship with our ornery little toddler! And believe me....she tests their patience on a daily basis! Unfortunately, many people think that dogs and babies cannot coexist peacefully. There is nothing further from the truth! If you prepare your dogs before the baby comes, there should be no issues. However, if you expect your dog(s) to accept a new baby with absolutely no preparations or accommodations on your part, it will not be a successful transition. As a dog rescuer and foster mom, I've seen far too many dogs brought to the shelter after a new baby was born simply because their owners did not think (or care enough) to plan ahead. With a little time and consistency, it can (and will) work. If you're expecting a baby and have dogs, you MUST purchase this book. It was invaluable to us!"
1710,5,It's fair to say that I'm a pretty cool guy. I know a pair of Farrah slacks when I see them. Women would literally walk past me on the street nervously giggling and pointing. My aura would let them now that I was the man about town. Why I'd think nothing of casually nipping into QuikSave and buying a frozen lasagne. I was that type of guy.<br /><br />So when I saw this book I realised that I could 'Bam it up a notch' So I read it with gusto. I rushed out to Bewise bought a heavy knit sweater and dyed my hair blond and stood by a black man.<br /><br />My life has never been so Awesome.
1711,5,"This is a very special book, what a great adventure for my two little boys to enjoy.  I have a 6 year old boy & 2 year old boy and both giggled with delight as I read about Peanut's adventure at the Christmas Parade, but the Texas Tornado was by far the hight of excitment.  This book is both beautifully illustrated as well as inspired by child-like love and faith, hope your family enjoys as much as mine does."
1712,5,"My mother absolutely loves this book, it had been hard to find her a book of just Cryptograms.  They are fun, and not that difficult for her to do."
1713,5,"As a long-term pastor with a long-term interest in Family Systems Theory, I'm grateful for this lean, thoughtful, empowering book by Margaret Marcuson. Reading it was an enjoyable way to review some familiar ground while also receiving many new insights. Full of practical, encouraging suggestions for navigating pastoral ministry, this book will stay on my shelf of \\""current important books\\"" for a long time.<br /><br />I particularly appreciate the lists of questions Margaret has created for nearly every chapter. Some are questions I need to be asking myself about my own functioning, while others are questions I need to be asking about the churches I serve. Many can be adapted for use in conversation with parishioners and leaders, and all of them are systems-based and thoughtful. The chapter on understanding money is one of the most helpful treatments I've ever read -- and perhaps the only one I've ever seen from a Family Systems perspective."
1714,5,Big fan of this book.  Had me from the very few pages.  Loved the characters and connected to each of them.  I enjoyed the hero coming home to the small town.  Couldn't wait to read Healed.
1715,4,"My daughter needed to go gluten-free for nursing her infant born in November, and she has tried several recipes from this book.<br />Very pleasing photography and meals so far."
1716,5,"Greg Cravens is one of the best and funniest cartoonists in America.  He really understands kids, teens, parents and grandparents and presents their lives in a funny (but kind) daily strip.  So glad he finally has a book published!"
1717,5,"Among those OT theology books, I just want to choose the rather thicker one.  I like Goldingay's publication, so I collect them."
1718,5,"An excellent read.  Munson mixes his superb analysis, personal experience from his wide travel experiences, and vast amounts of research and reading to craft policy recommendations I can only hope policy makers take to heart.<br /><br />The book is well written and engaging to read, he does a superb job of putting issues in proper historical context.  Don't think this book is only about warfare, he discusses conflict in relation to politics, and economics.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, it will make you think, and it will challenge you."
1719,5,This is the last book I needed to finish the series and when it came I was excited. The only thing is that the book jacket was missing but the book was in great condition.
1720,5,"\\""I liked the book I'll Follow the Moon because it is a repeating book and I liked the turtles in the pictures. The book was about a turtle having to get out of his egg and find its way out of the dirt and soil. He went to the water and he had to follow the moon to find his mom. \\"" -my 6 year-old<br /><br />My Thoughts:<br /><br />I thought this book was ADORABLE! The author combined a sweet rhyming tale with this beautiful phrase repeated through most of the book.<br /><br />\\""I'm coming, Mama, I'll see you soon<br />I know just how... I'll follow the moon\\""<br /><br />As a mom, this cause my heart to do some serious clenching. My 6 year old was able to read this comfortably by himself, only needing help with a couple words and the illustrations are perfect. The story is also educational, teaching little ones about the birth of turtles and how they find their way. This is one to read over and over to your children and would make a wonderful bedtime story.<br /><br />-Sara @ Forever 17 Books"
1721,4,"I will always insist to be careful with International Music editions since they always (so far) have a few mistakes (wrong rhythm, placement of notes, etc.) but they do publish music that you won't easily find somewhere else.<br /><br />In this case, you get the piano score (which is only 4 pages long) and the cello score separately. Like it's usual for this editorial, you don't get any fingerings in both piano and cello parts.<br /><br />I haven't worked yet on this music so I'm not sure if some or any mistakes are present but will try to update if I find anything. Other than that, It is a good/decent option to get since you won't find many printed versions of this piece."
1722,5,"Women of the Iberian Atlantic is a superb collection of analyses of the extremely significant roles of women in Spain and Portugal and their areas of conquest and influence on both sides of the Atlantic, with commentary expanding beyond to neighboring Pacific and Indian Ocean societies such as Peru and Goa.  This volume is a refreshing departure from the male and English-speaking orientations of many works regarding the early New World, especially when one considers the vast development of the Iberian-influenced lands for over a century prior to significant British imprints on the Western Hemisphere.<br /><br />Nuns, European brides, slaves of African origin, and indigenous Native American females all played high impact roles in the Iberian Atlantic world.  Especially useful is the volume's emphasis on women of the non-privileged and non-European classes, who, of course, made up the vast majority of New World females.  Women's roles not only included healing, motherhood, religious instruction, sexual partnership, cultivation, and food preparation and other domestic ventures, but also manufacture, commerce and land holding.<br /><br />One of the most fascinating essays in the book is that by Dr. Mangan pertaining to indigenous women as mothers in conquest-era Peru.  A high proportion of the women who bore children to Spanish men were in consensual relationships which often did not involve marriage, but very frequently involved paternal acknowledgment and support, occasionally to the extent of bringing the children back to Spain.  Women made fascinating and agile adaptations to the decline of the Inca empire and the rapid emergence of the colonial system and its intricate legal framework.  Mangan, of course, previously authored the groundbreaking Trading Roles: Gender, Ethnicity, and the Urban Economy in Colonial Potosi.<br /><br />Mangan, Owens and their ten other essay contributors have richly filled many gaps in historical knowledge about women and gender and aboutthe non-English-speaking Atlantic world."
1723,3,dont know how to judge this<br />it was a gift<br />maybe she liked it may be she didnt so ill give you a may be
1724,5,This is a great reading and coffee table book there is so much information about whiskey types and brands.If you like whiskey you will like this book.
1725,5,"This is a well researched book written by a scholar who also has first hand knowledge of the subject.  As the duly installed king of Gomoa Mprumem, Dr. Ephirim-Donkor is also the spiritual leader of his community.  With an earned doctorate from a US university and a commitment to document what is basically an oral tradition, the author has made a valuable, well-researched contribution to the field."
1726,5,Dorie speaks from experience; she has successfully reinvented herself several times! Great read and extremely applicable for working professionals of any age.
1727,5,Great book! Great pictures! Very well done! I love it and my son cannot get enough of it! :) Thanks so much!
1728,5,"Goff writes from a base of humility, combined with a visionary's approach to life.  i liked the 4-5 page sections, easy to polish off in a few minutes, but with enough grit to work on for a long time.  This is an inspiring book, but not in the usual style of same.  This is a man who intends to live a life of loving others without being pretensious or attention-seeking about it.  i could hardly put it down.  i purchased another 4 copies immediately to share with friends, after al, isn't that what &#34;Love Does&#34;??!!"
1729,5,Great selection of pretty borders to use on crochet projects! I use these for pillowcases that I've sewn for family and friends. Easy to use book and easy to follow directions. Thanks for such a great book!
1730,5,"Maryam Rostampour and Marziyeh Amirizadeh are two brave women who refused to compromise their faith in Jesus, even when threatened with torture and execution.  This book is the account of their 259 days in Evin Prison in Iran.  It opened my eyes to the injustice happening in Iran, strengthened my faith by demonstrating how God can work all things for good, and challenged me to examine the depth of my beliefs.<br /><br /> Living in the U.S. it is hard to imagine a place without justice or religious freedom.  A place where women are considered \\""property\\"" and justice is in the hands of the party who has been wronged. We take so much for granted.  In Iran, there are many women imprisoned unfairly and held in terrible living conditions. Many of their stories are shared in these pages.  Maryam and Marziyeh went to prison for sharing their faith with others.  But what they discovered was that they were put \\""in the best place they had ever been for witnessing to people hungry for the gospel of Jesus.\\""  The authorities thought prison would teach these girls a lesson.  Instead, God got the last laugh.  The prison became their church.  Between being able to minister to the people there and the world-wide publicity their case received, the gospel was spread even further!<br /><br /> I was struck by something Anne Graham Lotz wrote in the forward.  Maryam and Marziyeh told her that \\""it had been easier for them to experience God's peace and presence and power inside Evin Prison than on the outside in America.\\""  Wow.  They could have been released much sooner from prison had they compromised their faith, but they didn't.  Would many Christians in America be able to do the same thing?  Would I?<br /><br /> This book is well-written and worth the time to read.  May we stop taking our freedom for granted and lift up in prayer those who aren't as fortunate.  Thank you, Maryam and Marziyeh, for sharing your story with the world.<br /><br />*I received a complimentary copy of this bookfrom Tyndale in exchange for an honest review."
1731,5,"Enthralled from cover to cover!  Just when you think you've figured out the 'secret', the author throws another twist in this vivid and colorful adventure.  Great Christian message for everyone.  This novel gets my vote for the big screen.  Look forward to the sequel."
1732,5,"This Bible was purchased for someone who has everything, so I just combined both of their passion in life. They love racing and God. They were extremely excited about this Bible."
1733,4,This book saves me from making more flaws in my writting for Spanish class. It comes in handy and it's good.
1734,5,The author really conveys the depths of the human soul with her poetry!!  Pain and sorrow as well as joy can be found here.  Not just heart-full but soulful as well!  Looking forward to more from this author!
1735,5,"This book was really good.  It seemed a little rushed at the very beginning, but after a couple chapters I was hooked.  It could have been longer though."
1736,5,"This book 'Lean In\\"" is a true reflection of me...I have always had a very open dialogue with my daughter.  And I have taken considerable time and effort when it came to preparing and explaining life and its many journey's.  When I read this book I knew it was one more piece I needed to add to my daughters arsenal.  Because todays young woman has to be prepared for life challenges...I had to put it on my website [...]"
1737,5,"Whose Tail on the Trail at Grand Canyon is an interactive educational experience for primary grade children.  The clever rhyme and darling pictures engage the kids and have them guessing aloud about the identity of the next animal on the trail.  This was read to several K-1 classes at our school, and was a huge hit.  Appropriate for K-3 (our third graders loved it as much as the little guys).  Keep them coming!"
1738,3,The book is nice. They are easy to fallow recipes. But the book I received was missing a whole section of pages.
1739,5,"Last year, I reviewed the well written Bicoastal Babe by Cynthia Langston and I was sent the author's newest novel last week free of charge in exchange for my honest review. I enjoyed the author's first novel, so I was more than eager to start reading The Very First Bite. I know it sounds like the title of a vampire book, but there is no supernatural plot here.<br /><br />Actually, the plot is very realistic involving a thirty-something-year-old Lanie Albers who is dreading, but somewhat looking forward to her upcoming fifteenth high school reunion, which is only ten weeks away. She can't fit into that old prom dress anymore as she has put on around twenty pounds extra weight and baggage over the years. She is not the kind of person who likes to exercise or diet, but she is desperate to try anything from extreme diets (Adkins, Nutrisystem, Organic, diet pills, etc), overcrowded gyms, to an at home yoga DVD.<br /><br />Lanie's life isn't perfect as she has a dead-end job and a non-committing UPS driver boyfriend (Mark). She gets advice from her younger and thinner sister, Libby, and several friends, including the guy, Lance, who lives in her apartment building. Memories of the past keeping haunting her, mostly about her high school boyfriend, Chad, and her ex-best-friend, Candace, forcing her to fall off every diet she tries. Despite some setbacks, Lanie is determined to drop those twenty pounds so she can flaunt her new body at the reunion, but she might not have a date as things with Mark are quickly going down the toilet.<br /><br />I have never laughed so hard while reading a book before, like I did with The Very First Bite. Even though I'm a male, I can completely relate to everything Lanie is going through as I'm about the same age, I've been trying to get into shape this year, and I'm dreading getting the invite to my high school reunion, but she has more courage than I have as I would never attend my reunion. There is some adult language throughout the novel, but each word is hilariously used for every situation Lanie finds herself in. Poor Lanie finds herself trying to use the fast and easy way to diet, which never works and she ends up wasting her money on fad products. I loved the part when she went to the checkout carrying the self-help books and the checker is someone went to high school with. The author did a wonderful job creating a realistic plot and a loveable character. I can easily see the book being made into a quirky comedy feature film. Overall, I enjoyed reading every word of The Very First Bite and I recommend it to other readers as you'll find yourself laughing all the way through it.but each word is hilariously used for every situation Lanie finds herself in.

1740,5,"I was VERY pleased that I ordered the book on Tuesday and received it Thursday...however...no place indicated that the edition was \\""large print\\"" which had I had the option I would not have purchased.  Since it is for a birthday present, I will be able to tie into the fact that \\""cheater glasses\\"" won't be needed to read this edition!"
1741,5,"You know the Disney version of Robin Hood, with the whistling rooster and Robin Hood as a fox? When I hear the names of Richard the Lionhearted and Prince John, that movie is the first thing that comes to mind: royal personages as lions with crowns. So picking up a biography about the mother of these two was eye opening for me. Kind of like stepping into a world of legend and fairy tale and finding it populated with history and fact.<br /><br />Eleanor of Aquitaine was quite a woman. Especially considering that she lived in a time that valued meekness and submission in women. The wife of two kings and the mother of three others, she went on crusade, ruled in her husband's absence, helped her sons plan an uprising against their father (and was subsequently imprisoned for her role in it), and wrote letters to the pope. I found this book difficult to put down. Alison Weir's prose is lively and engaging, and she spends time not only telling the story, but also exploring and debunking common legends and misconceptions surrounding Eleanor and other people close to her. Whether you're interested in the Middle Ages, or just enjoy a good biography, I would highly recommend this book."
1742,3,I'm not sure why but I was expecting a book with more in depth information. The information it did give was good I just wanted to know more.I had problems with ordering and paying for a new book and ended up getting a used library book. I have to say that I was offered a new book or a return of half the money I spent.They were very prompt in handling this matter.
1743,5,"Ordered this book (along with Oh,la, la) for my Grandson's Easter basket - he loves both books and is having a ball making designs he hadn't seen before!  Huge Success on this gift!"
1744,3,Louise the Silk Weaver's daughter is a French Huguenot who must run with her family to England to escape persecution by King Louis XIV'S dragoons. The story is a good one and held my interest. It's tale weaves through the Silk road to East India and beyond. Kindle subscription.
1745,5,"This book is part of a series (which I follow along) but you don't need to read the others to enjoy this book (although they are excellent and it doesn't hurt).<br />This is a romance novel of mystical creatures, the vampire Trehan and a halfling (demon but mostly sorceress) Bettina.  Trehan decides to enter a tournament to the death to win the right to marry Bettina and rule a demon plane to which she is princess of. The main catch is that her best friend and love of her life also enters the tournament, making this difficult for Trehan, while he is making her question her childhood romance at the same time.<br />One of the things I love most about this author is that she laces the different novels together so well.  It isn't like most series where the next book begins where the last one ended. Which is worst in romance novel series, I mean, can characters not be going through their own story until their friend's ends?  This author has many stories going on at the same time, for example her last book of Lothaire is still \\""taking place\\"" while we read about Bettina and Trehan (only we know how Lothaire's story ends if you read the last book), and we get glimpses of the next stories to come because she lets little pieces into the current book as well.<br />Definitely a must read and I can't wait until the next installment in the series."
1746,5,"[[ASIN:1477148388 SAME SAME]]DOUG SMITH'S THRILLER, SAME SAME, CRUISES THROUGH EXCITING PLOTS AND EXTRAORDINARY CHARACTER PORTRAYALS CLEARLY VISIBLE THROUGH MASTERFUL DIALOGUE.  HIS STORY COULD  EASILY BE ADAPTED TO A HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL SCREEN PLAY FOR THE CINEMA. IT WAS GREAT READING WITH A HEAVY TOUCH OF HUMOR AND THE  COMPETITIVE STRUGGLE AMONG WRITERS."
1747,5,I can't believe this book is going for over 400 dollars. I paid 27 dollars back in 2011.  I love the art but 400 is to much.
1748,5,"Got my first &#34;God Wants a Powerful People&#34; from a friend and had to order a few more to send to friends and family.<br />So many great insights, I love the way she teaches, wrote down many things that I have shared with others besides<br />sending the book to those who would like it too..."
1749,5,"Brian, you just pulled it all together for me in this book. I like what \\""Gen C\\"" is all about and I also enjoy \\""old school\\"" relationships. As you share in your book, those of use who adapt and understand the new relationships, connections and methods of connecting will be best positioned to personally and professionally prosper. Also as you noted in your book, those people and companies that don't won't be around. It's an exciting time to be alive and help guide this process. Excellent \\""must read\\"" book for anyone who is serious about the next decade of business. Look forward to seeing you in Orange County! Mitch Jackson"
1750,2,"A second volume in and I'm just not feeling this iteration of X-Men. Wolverine as the headmaster of a school? WTF!?! This deserves a, &#34;C'Mon man!&#34; moment. Wolverine should just be killing bad guys. Period. If you want a your X-Men fix this is suitable. The art is fine in an Art Adams kind of way. The Brood is getting old. The space casino is interesting. Kid Omega is the shining moment in this book. But if you just want Wolverine doing what he does best read all of Rick Remender's Uncanny X-Force. This book was just okay. Not really recommend unless you're sitting at Barnes & Noble and you have 30 minutes free time while drinking your coffee."
1751,5,I read this to my older kids who  are now 15 and 13. I absolutely loves the story and we always kissed hands before anything that might be a little scary. So reading it to my 4 year old and 5 month old was a givin!
1752,5,"Thud is in the &#34;Vimes&#34; family of Discworld, and deals with the topic of racism (dwarves and trolls) in a satirical, funny, and thought-provoking manner."
1753,1,"This is Volume II all right, but the last page is 708, out of about 1,000 pages the book is supposed to have.  I wanted to read the part about the Ohio Calvary, starting on page 745, so the book is useless to me.<br /><br />Since this was fulfilled by Amazon, I'm amazed that they don't check on the product they are shipping.  They didn't even include a packing slip or anything else to use to ship this book back.<br /><br />If you're only interested in Ohio Infantry regiments in the Civil War, this will be okay, but it's not nice to sell a book when it is so incomplete."
1754,4,"Review:<br />Rating: 4 Stars<br />This is book two in this series. I did a quick reread of the first book, Once Burned, before reading the new book. I enjoyed this one a lot more! The first book left such a cliffhanger that it made it feel really incomplete. There will be another book after this one, but this one answers a lot of unanswered questions than the last one. I love Vlad! Leila is the perfect woman for him because he needs someone unafraid of him and all his enemies. She won’t accept anything less than his heart. Lots of steamy romance and plenty of action! Can not wait for the next book in the series!"
1755,5,I love this book on my coffee table.  I live in Dallas and guests always love flipping through this book!
1756,5,Dr Jeff Riggenbach does a marvelous job of writing clearly and directly to address a wide variety of challenges that all too often are obfuscated by cloudy analytical thinking.<br /><br />Bravo!<br /><br />I do confess that I'm a huge fan and I've had the pure pleasure of listening to many hours of Dr Riggenbach's lectures on a wide variety of subjects.
1757,5,A birthday gift for my niece.  She loves the book.  One has to be somewhat careful with the pop-ups but they are worth the effort and add to the enjoyment of the story.
1758,5,This book had me on edge of my seat! Very exciting!!!! Couldn't put it down.<br />Definitely recommend to anyone who loves a good romance and excitement
1759,4,"What would it be like to be tricked, taken against your will, loaded onto a ship sailing for the colonies, and sold as an indentured servant? That's what we find out in Beyond The Valley. In the midst of hardship, the courage of Sarah Carr shines through!<br /><br />After the death of her husband, Sarah goes to the only family she has for help. Betrayed by them, she is tricked onto a ship sailing for the colonies. Dirty and hungry, she faces the humiliation of standing on a platform, being inspected like livestock. What will become of her?<br /><br />This story reminded me a lot of Job. Through out all of the trails Sarah goes through, she never loses her faith in her Savior. She never loses her spunk either! She stands her ground when asked to do something she won't do - for example, to become her master's mistress. No, she won't do it.<br /><br />Sarah is a fiery red head, beautiful, except for a slight impediment. One of her legs is shorter than the other, giving her a limp when she walks. Some people see it as a weakness, but Sarah is a strong, hard worker, she holds her head up high when they look down at her.  I liked her a lot! She is very strong! Her suffering does not stop after she is bought. She endures many injustices; the threat of being sold to someone else, hunger, being killed or captured by Indians to name a few. She gets caught up in a web of deceit that is heartbreaking.<br /><br />When she meets Dr Alex Hutton and his adorable nieces, she falls in love. Alex is also taken with Sarah, and he tries to convince Mr. Wentworth, Sarah's master, to sell her to him. Wentworth refuses and sells Sarah to Mr. Thrasher, a trapper, who takes her into the frontier to help keep his house and cook for him. In the frontier,  she faces the danger of Indian raids. Will Alex be able to find her, or is she lost to him forever.<br /><br />In this historical novel, we see some of the many struggles women faced in the 1700s. They did not have many rights. It could be avery hard life, especially for a woman with no family to protect her.<br /><br />I enjoyed Beyond the Valley! This is the third book in the Daughters of the Potomac Series. It does stand alone. I have not read the first two, but I might have to!<br /><br />**I received a copy of the book for my honest review.**"
1760,5,"Real stories, real life, real missionaries in the poorest country in the world, Mozambique. Miracles & wonders. Exceptional,  supernatural book!!"
1761,5,"So many weird things I did not know about Arizona, even tho I wintered there for many years.  Very interesting reading."
1762,5,"I loved the characters in this book. It was easy to empathize with the main character, Errol. In his mind, he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. But one of the overarching themes of the book is God (referred to as Deas) doesn't make mistakes. No one is in the wrong place at the wrong time; Errol is appointed by Deas for a particular purpose.<br /><br />This is a story of a battle . . . a battle between good and evil, light and darkness. Ultimately it's a story of the battle between spiritual forces. In this book, there are men who want to destroy the church and the men who serve the church. There are others committed to serving God. They are locked together in an epic battle for the life of the nation.<br /><br />This is a great book, easy to read, thought-provoking, and enjoyable."
1763,5,Love it I would recommend this book to anyone who loves the victorian times its a must in your manga collection if you love manga
1764,5,You rendered excellent service.  It was well received on the day that I needed it most. It definitely met my expectations.  Thanks.
1765,5,"Mark Gruenwald's titular creation comes to life within the 12-issue maxi-series he created. The story revolves around the Squadron Supreme and their decision to take the world over in hopes of bringing forth a utopia in which humans can live freely without worry of violence, crime, or disease! However, the path to this \\""heaven on earth\\"" is more treacherous than the Squadron originally thought as old members become new enemies and the humanity of the super-human members begin to show. The utopian environments creation may very well be earth's darkest day! After that, within the graphic novel Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe, the Squadron is still trying to deal with the aftermath of their plot all while an entity is headed straight for earth and eating up the universe as he moves! The Squadron has to rely on the help of some of their worst enemies to save the earth and everything they fought for!<br /><br />Mark's epic series is collected here in full in this oversized, sewn-binding hardcover with a nice dust-jacket depicting a cover by Alex Ross. The book includes the 12-issue Squadron Supreme series along with Captain America #314, and the Death of a Universe graphic novel following the series. All the original covers are there as well as a foreword by Mark's wife Catherine and Mark himself talking about his creation within the first few pages. At the end, we get an afterword by Ralph Macchio and an excerpt from issue 29 of the Marvel Age magazine that featured an article about the Squadron Supreme series. Also included is creator commentary that was included in the TPB.<br /><br />Overall, the story here is a classic, ageless tale that goes deep within the confines of comic books and makes you really question the actions of the Squadron and their enemies. It gives a feeling of `who's right and who's wrong?' at times and even has you rooting for the bad guys on several occasions. The Squadron starts out with Hyperion, Blue Eagle, Nuke, Power Princess, Lady Lark, Archer, Whizzer, Dr. Spectrum, Tom Thumb, Arcanna, Nighthawk and Amphibian (parallels with the Justice League run rampant). However, even within 12 issues, members die, leave, or get replaced. This story reveals death as it truly is (and not how most comics see death as temporary) and shows the grave mistakes even a superhero can make. The idea of a utopia obviously has some members on edge immediately with the idea that they'll merely be creating a \\""nice\\"" dictatorship and the decriminalization and brainwashing techniques used for good were still stomping all over the rights of the people and their free will. These points made were groundbreaking for 1985 and even today are questioned in society. The fluidity of the wonderful story and the genius writing by Mark just moves you right through the pages and really immerses you within the story. The art by Bob Hall, Paul Ryan, John Buscema, and Paul Neary look very nice as well. As classic as it is, it still has flaws like the sometimes goofy or corny storylines and the enemy designs like Pinball, the fat man who inflates into a ball and rolls over people. Or, Ape X, the legless cyber-primate. The Captain America issue seemed a bit pointless as well and served more as a way to throw a famous Marvel character into the mix. Thankfully, it was very short-lived.<br /><br />Ryan's art with Death of a Universe worked well but the coloring by Paul Becton seemed very painted and a little too flushed. Otherwise, you still get a fantastic story (although not near the original maxi-series) about setting aside differences and having to trust those who you hated only moments ago. It keeps with canon very well so there are no sudden appearances by formerly dead allies or real changes to costumes or wounds. However, there are still a few silly things (giant, sentient floating babies come to mind) but overall another fun experience written by Mark.<br /><br />Overall, this is definitely a story to read and this omnibus is definitelythe way to read it. The gorgeous reproduction and the timeless story contained within make this book worth every penny.<br /><br />Overall Rating: 9 out of 10the way to read it.

The &#34;booklet&#34; consists of two pages, which is approximately 4&#34;x6&#34;. Cute stickers and I'm sure she'll love them.

1767,5,"We just relocated to the Front Range from western North Carolina and I needed to discover some new training routes. This book is well written and kind of funny at times, too."
1768,5,"This is a great reference book and that is how I use it. The photos and drawings are right to the T. The book is a little heavy but that means it has much information inside. I use this book regularly. Happy to have it close at hand. A super purchase too. Thanks. Sincerely, Rick L."
1769,5,This book is specific to my area of the country.  Very helpful and lots of good advice and reference material.
1770,5,As a former Queens native and street foodie I love this book and intend to use it to explore more great food options
1771,5,"I received a copy of this in exchange for my honest opinion. Everything you are about to read is my full and honest opinion about the book!<br /><br />  What a great start to a new series! I really enjoy this book very much! The description drew me in from the start and I'm glad it did because I was NOT disappointed! The chapters flowed together with ease, even with the different POV it was still easy for me to understand what was happening with each Character!<br /><br />Here's the Plot~<br /><br />  Sofia's taking a walk one night on the beach when she is kidnapped and sent to an island to become slave for the most Powerful Vampire Coven in the world! She becomes a captive forced to do what these vampires want, when they want! That is until she tries to escape but gets caught. So Sofia's only other option for survival is to catch the Vampire Prince's attention, and keep it! That shouldn't be hard, right, with the all the other women slaves thinking the same thing!<br /><br />  I really, really, liked this book and I am eager to see what the next book brings! I definitely would recommended this book to anyone that likes a good vampire thrill!<br /><br />  Overall it gets a 5 stars in my book!"
1772,5,"As a child I can recall listening to my grandparents and always wanting them to be proud of me. Today, I can still remember old saying from them. Helping us grow up to be strong women and men was something to be proud of back in the day. I miss those times. This book places emphasis on those old days and helps me to remember that I am to \\""be strong\\""."
1773,4,"With limited treatment available for this disease, the book was very helpful to my husband who is struggling to cope."
1774,5,"Angus Whyte is having a fabulous life; great adventures, delightful friends and humorous rivalries.  He shares all of this with us in a book that is fun, funny and deeply touching.  You will pick it up and wonder what happened to the time as you seek a place to stop.<br />Grab this short but wonderful book and prepare to experience charm and humor from a master story teller."
1775,5,"I first came across this book years ago when someone from Central Christian Church left it by the door to my father's apartment.  There is a story in here about Henry Prendes, who was a police sergeant for the the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.  I did not know Henry, but in reading about his last day here in physical was truly amazing."
1776,4,"If you've DMed before, you can skip this unless you were terrible at it. Personally, I found it helpful in some ways, but in others, its mainly tells how to tell a story and keep others interested. There were somethings i didn't know, but most it was more common sense.<br /><br />Overall, I'm happy I bought it, but if you're a DM and are good at it...skip this one."
1777,5,"I have used these books with my older children and am so glad they are still around. Besides helping stretch their minds and increase vocabulary it helped their SAT scores. It is a quick, easy way to accomplish this goal in their studies."
1778,2,"I loved Divergent and I couldn't wait for Insurgent to come out, but now I'm finding Insurgent unpleasant to read, and it took me ages to get beyond the opening chapters.  (Things do pick up later.)<br /><br />[ONE] I wanted to re-bond with the characters but the opening doesn't offer anything to grip onto. The book starts with a cast of characters (rather than individual characters) who are not really speaking to each other, and not really doing anything except waiting.  They all have a shell-shocked attitude with emotional numbness.  (Do they all have to deal with trauma uniformly?)<br /><br />[TWO] Insurgent is unreadable unless you've read Divergent recently.  The author expects readers to remember everything from Divergent.  I do agree that most sequel books have too much catch-up.  Often a summary of the previous book is pasted artlessly onto the opening of the second book.  That's very annoying too. With Insurgent the pendulum has swung too far in the opposite direction, and the author doesn't provide even single words reminding the reader of anything in the previous book.  I don't need paragraphs and paragraphs of backstory, I just need to have something evoke what I already absorbed from the previous book.  I remember my mental image of the boyfriend and my mental image of the brother, but I don't remember their literal names.  The word brother could have been slipped into the text very smoothly without disrupting the flow.  For people who remember the names but not the images, a little bit of description would have been possible.  Instead I'm reading a pseudo-profound passage where the shell-shocked girl is touching the shoulder of a shell-shocked guy, and the pseudo-poignancy is totally lost on me because the author refuses to say whether this guy is her brother or her boyfriend.<br /><br />Anybody who has read Divergent will remember the concept of categorizing people by their choice of dominant philosophy, but will EVERY reader remember the 5 names of the 5 philosophies? If you've forgotten one, that's really too bad, because the author refuses to mention the 5 categories in the opening chapters.<br /><br />These problems are the fault of the editor, who should have been an experienced professional with a stronger hand.he 5 philosophies?

1779,4,"Sundays without an episode of \\""Downton Abbey\\"" to look forward to in the evenings is like meatloaf without buttered mashed potatoes and gravy. For weeks,I've been literally starving, now on a forced diet until January 6, 2014. But wait, there is a reprieve; a little sorbet to keep us salivating until next year.<br /><br />Fay Weldon, the co-writer of many episodes of the BBC show, \\""Upstairs, Downstairs\\"", created by and starring Jean Marsh, has penned a trilogy set in the same time (and places) as our beloved \\""Downton Abbey\\"". Even some of her characters' names are the same; even their situations and circumstances are quite remarkably similar. And the beauty of her novels is that we can read them any time, not just on wintery Sunday evenings. This is the first novel of the series, in which we find Earl Robert and Lady Isobel, heads of the Hedleigh of Dilberne clan, on the brink of bankruptcy, plotting for their seemingly wayward son, Arthur to marry a rich heiress to save their estates and reputation and place in London's High Society at the turn of the last century. Sound all too familiar? Enter vastly rich Tessa O'Brien (read boisterous \\""Molly Brown\\"" played by Shirley MacClaine here) and her beautiful, but \\""flawed\\"" daughter, Minnie--heiress to her father's Chicago meat-packing enterprises--and we have what one British critic in the Guardian Review termed \\""...an entertaining romp for Downton Abbey fans...\\"". Entertaining a read this book might be, I found it to be somewhat of a knock-off. Weldon seems to be capitalizing on her early 1970s \\""Upstairs, Downstairs\\"" fame and has jumped onto Julian Fellowes' coattails, going along for the richly, rewarding ride.<br /><br />Once I did get into the swing of Weldon's run-on-sentence and convoluted explanatory style, I found this novel a really decent read, albeit a bit too reminiscent of DA. \\""Habits of the House\\"" is only the first of Weldon's trilogy. [[ASIN:1250028000 Long Live the King]] is yet to come to America on April 13of this year, with [[ASIN:1250028027 The New Countess]] soon to follow. Only Weldon and her publishers know what is to befall her delightful characters, upstairs and downstairs alike. But if her second and third titles are any indications, one need not second-guess; we pretty much already get the gist of the remaining plot lines. Our fond hope is that they are better written than the first.<br /><br />My only concern is that Weldon chopped up her ending in the last third of the novel--as if she was in a rush to dispense with writing and quickly finish the book. The denouement lacked the style and explanations I had come to enjoy in the beginning. A few dangling loose ends were quite disappointing, although I hope the author picks up her threads again in the second novel with a bit more diligence.<br /><br />Still, this novel and its successors were/are/will be welcomed stop-gaps in the emptiness/void formed by the ending of DA 3. Weldon's literary endeavors--three of the many novels she has written over the course of the past thirty some-odd years. Hopefully, they will tide me until our beloved \\""Downton Abbey\\"" once again returns in all its original glory.<br /><br />Submitted by June J. McInerney, Literary Blogger and author of \\""The Basset Chronicles\\""."
1780,1,"The premise diminishes the concept of the Egyptian Queen ISIS, who reigned 3000 years ago, assuring prosperity, power and progress and died of natural causes, not suicide. A researcher's comparison of the deaths of Sylvia Plath and Marilyn Monroe predates this work and was presented to the Coroner's Office as part of a theory, but this work was not credited."
1781,2,"** spoiler alert **<br />** spoiler alert **<br />** spoiler alert **<br />** spoiler alert **<br /><br />I like how Nicholas Sparks portrays romances, and I'm not a romance buff, I find them easy reads. I cannot stand finishing a book feeling more depressed and pessimistic at the end than before I ever read the book. What I don't like is building up this support for this couple the entire book and then in the end they don't end up together. It leaves me feeling so depressed. This passionate against all odds we can make it through anything love just peters away? And no matter how much they love each other and still do, it's ok to marry someone else because waiting for him was just too hard? No wonder half the world gets divorced. I know that is how \\""real life\\"" works. But when I'm reading a book, or watching a movie I want to be \\""entertained.\\"" If I want real life I'll watch the news or look at divorce statistics. The end really makes it or breaks it for me hence such a low score. I'm a fan of fairy tale endings. Make me cry at the beginning, or the middle, but not at the end."
1782,3,The overall tone of the book is positive. I found some of ideas helpfull and liked the practice tips at the end of each chapter. But in my opinion her writing style is unnecessary long.
1783,4,"Usually, crime novels are written to hook the reader on the first or second page.  This one isn't like that.  It took  a long time to engage my interest and I almost decided to move on to another book.  I'm glad I didn't.  Believe me, the story gets better and better and I'm now waiting for the second in its series.<br /><br />The protagonist, Avraham (Avi) Avraham, is an experienced Israeli police detective yet, seemingly bungles his way through an investigation.  There's a bit of the TV detective, 'Columbo', in him.  The reader doesn't think much of his skills--at first.<br /><br />He's able to think of things his colleagues don't, but misses some obvious details.  And just when you think the case is solved (not once, but twice), new facts emerge, changing everything you think you know.  THE MISSING FILE is a slow-paced page turner, the kind of novel you won't appreciate until you're farther into the story.  D.A. Mishani's writing grows on you, albeit slowly.  Think of it as acquiring a taste.  Initially, you don't like it or, are unimpressed.  But, subsequent tries make you an avid lover of his work.<br /><br />His details suffice, but he doesn't  provide extensive descriptions.  Characters develop slowly and when I try to visualize them, I see them in black and white, not in color.  His dialogue is sparse, too.  The reader has to decipher the meaning in some of the conversations.<br /><br />I found it odd that, in a country where children begin kindergarten together and progress through school together, and then enter the army together, our Avi has virtually no friends.  It's a dichotomy that simply did not ring true for me (and I lived there for a number of years).<br /><br />Despite the shortcomings, I want to read Mishani's second novel in this series, as the ending is clearly TO BE CONTIINUED."
1784,5,This book is PACKED with valuable information that's easy to take in and use. I've highlighted and dog-eared a lot of it! I highly recommend this book for both amateur and professional athletes.
1785,5,"This little book holds a wealth of information on why Catholics fast and how to fast out of love.  After reading and meditating on what Sister 'Emmanuel writes, I am able to fast much easier."
1786,4,"I'm always open to recommendations on war memoirs. Tim O'Brien's The Things They Carried is one of those books. I could not believe that a book published 23 years ago is in such demand still, that I had to get on the waiting list, to borrow the digital version from my library. When I started it, from the cover, I noticed it was listed as a work of fiction and was not sure how to proceed. However, as O'Brien explains in the book, no war story is true, at least from the first person perspective, because that perspective is so limited and so warped by the intensity of the moment.<br /><br />His stories, and this is a collection of stories, are horrific. They are crafted and honed by a very good storyteller, he even tells how he added and took away elements from one story, Speaking of Courage, as he rewrote it for this collection. I believe his stories have plenty of truth, as I've found fiction hardly ever approaches reality in strangeness and capriciousness. But, by telling us he is writing fiction, O'Brien gets to use the label as a shield from judgement as he relates war atrocities he witnessed and may have participated in. He can write in first person something he might have done without actually confessing to it. I think this was a brilliant move on O'Brien's part. His writing is brilliant as well. His craft is top shelf. Although this isn't Vietnam's novel, like [[ASIN:1619491729 The Red Badge of Courage]] is for the American Civil War, it is an excellent testament to Vietnam.<br /><br />One story grabbed me emotionally, Speaking of Courage. I identified with the Bible believing Baptist, a native American from Oklahoma named Kiowa, whom O'Brien described in all his dimensions. He's not presented as a one dimensional Bible thumper, but as a believer with a heritage distinct from his comrades, and foibles that his faith did not keep him from. He was a great soldier and friend, yet he died in a random and terrifying way. As a Bible thumper myself, I imagined the story behind the story, the world Kiowa lived in, that even O'Brien might not have known. When he died, I lost a friend. He was a representative of me in the story. I mourned for Kiowa as well.<br /><br />O'Brien says he never suffered nightmares after he came home. But he says his stress, his therapy, is manifest as a compulsive story teller of the Vietnam war. This book is unique in my reading of war memoirs, I can't compare it to anything else, but I am more than happy to pass on the recommendation to read it.ry behind the story, the world Kiowa lived in, that even O'Brien might not have known.

1787,5,"This was book was just what I needed - an historical overview, some of the basic chemical compounds, description for each oil and then practical use for today. It is easy to read & understand and I will use this book often as a resource for the essential oil classes that I teach.<br /><br />I use another brand of essential oils but I did not mind that the author uses & explains her brand.<br /><br />I would recommend this as a beginning book for anyone who wants to learn about essential oils & helping others to be well."
1788,5,"Grievous Offense is Nancy Steedle's 3rd book, the 2nd in the Donovan Burke series.  This time Burke has his hands full with the gruesome discovery of a murder that has everyone wondering what kind of madman is on the loose.<br /><br />This book is much darker than Winter Kill and shows the range of Nancy's talents as a writer.  I know her as a lovely lady who doesn't look at all like she could create such terrible crimes for the villains to commit and her characters to solve!  By the time I reached the climax of the story, I had told everyone to leave me alone because I HAD to figure out who the sadistic killer was and whether or not everyone I had come to care about would survive.<br /><br />Suspense, drama, excitement, Grievous Offense has it all.  Nancy has once again put her characters in harm's way and it is up to them to figure out how to deal with what she gives them.  With another cliff-hanger ending, Nancy has assured me there will be more books, I just have to be patient.  Easier said than done!"
1789,4,"According to Merriam-Webster dictionary the word obligation means:  The action of obliging oneself to a course of action, as by a promise or vow.  When you make a promise you should be willing to keep it or don't make it, this is exactly what Peaches did vowed to keep her promise even if it kills her.<br /><br />Peaches Donnelly is a woman who likes to take care of people that she cares about.  She is very dedicated to her job, her family and her friends and when she sees an injustice done it doesn't sit well with her.  Childhood friend Lenny Richards is murdered and Peaches is distraught about his death, when Lenny's mother asks if Peaches can look into his murder she just can't say no.  Peaches doesn't know what she can do to help after all she is just an Administrative Manager but she does feel a strange sense of obligation to Lenny and his mother to see what she can find out.  Peaches has no formal training in being any type of investigator besides being a woman and we all know that women are naturally nosy, but she feels like she might be able to help a little bit.  Little does Peaches know that Lenny is not leading the life that she remembers from high school and this might turn into being more than she can handle.<br /><br />Peaches and The Gambler is an exciting read with the typical dramas that go along with a who-done-it.  There is always going to be some sort of family drama, relationship drama, life or death drama but it is a good refreshing read that will keep you interested in finding out who done it right along with Peaches.  This is my first time reading Hicks, but I look forward to reading more from her in the future."
1790,5,This is a great book for seeing into the mindset of the newly rich American set and thier quest to &#34;fit in&#34; which still resounds today. Although class distinction is not as great today there is still the push to move up. Very great book.
1791,1,"Who publishes a book about the most beautiful woman in Hollywood and only has two small black-and-white photos of her inside the book and one color photo on the cover?  All of the information in the book can be found on the internet in only a few minutes.  There is nothing in the book that would thrill a Stana Katic fan.  The publisher was looking for a quick payday with this book taking advantage of fans hoping for a true glimpse into the life of the star of ABC's Castle.  Unless you are a hopeless Stana Katic die-hard fan, you don't need this book.  Save your money."
1792,3,"In case you are wondering, this is the second book in the series.  I gave the first book 1 star because really nothing at all happened for over 300 pages.  You can start with the second book, skipping the first entirely, and not feel like you've missed anything important.  In the first book, a fisherman left his village in search of work in the big city, hoping to save enough money to someday buy his own boat.  He befriended a prince, found work in the prince's horse stables, and met a shady woman whose business seems to be keeping secrets.  The \\""ruling class\\"" are a bunch of magicians, who fled their homeland to avoid being killed by one of their own who went crazy.  The non-magic folk offered them sanctuary in exchange for protection, which is in the form of a magical wall separating their kingdom from the rest of the world, where the evil wizard still makes nightmares come true and such.  Anyway, nothing important happens in the first book, except the fisherman becomes an important political figure in the city, gets close to the prince, and annoys some of the palace staff and the magicians because he has no manners.  Yep I rated the first book 1 star only.<br /><br />Very dry style, with some awkward attempts at inventing localized dialects. Very slow continuation of events from the first book, flirts with the border between slow and boring. Characters are mostly 1-dimensional (or 2-dimensional at best) and stereotypical. The author invents this entire universe, and then proceeds to have the main \\""hero\\"" character interact with the same four characters almost exclusively; you never get to witness anything beyond the tiny bubble of space around these four characters. You don't get to taste the flavors of a fully-developed place; the description of the palace and city are pretty sparse and you never leave the well-trod path.  Also, the action doesn't really pick up until about halfway through this book.  Even then, it's mostly political maneuvering and scheming.  I won't spoil the ending for you, but the first few hundred pages of this one are only marginally better than the first volume.  Once the action starts, the author does toy with some interesting plot devices, but if I had written this book I would have given a lot more richness to the characters and the environment.  Hence 2 star deduction.<br /><br />Anyways, read a couple of random pages and decide if you can handle the author's style before you decide if it's worth the time and effort of reading the whole story.  If your mind is set and you're going for it, I would recommend skipping \\""The Innocent Mage\\"" and starting with this book instead."
1793,5,"I really like how this book gives recipes, especially for smoothies, of things to put together so I can get well rounded meals/snacks!"
1794,5,"I like all of Alexander Kent's &#34;Richard Bolitho&#34; novels--including this one--about the English navy during the days of iron men in wooden ships. They are somewhat similar to the &#34;Hornblower&#34; novels, which I also like. You will best enjoy them in the order published, but they can stand on their own."
1795,3,"The 4th book in this series, is a little boring.<br />The 3rd book was a hard act to follow!<br />This one mostly deals with Theon Greyjoy's family and Dorne, with a bunch of Cersei and Jamie chapters."
1796,1,"Not sure how this managed to get published.  As if written by a small child, with no evidence of an editorial presence."
1797,3,"I'm always looking for fresh new writers and had thought perhaps this was one of them.  While her book was new , I found the stories to be rather dull and sad.  Not very soothing on a grey winter day."
1798,4,"I really like it, it has a good introduction with some tips for time management and then the month schedule that's very helpful."
1799,5,"An excellent debut novel.  Great characters and suspense, with humorous dialogue and situations mixed in.  I'll be on the lookout for the sequel!"
1800,5,ThIs collection of true tales are a great example of the power of story. Just the right length to share an experience and draw some meaning from it. Entertaining and inspiring.  It gave me two new authors to read (Gemmell and Kelman) and stories from some favorites (Lloyd and Courtenay to name just two).  Also motivates me to write about my own experiences.
1801,5,"I am pleased with the product.  Although concise, it has a wealth of information that will complement the study of the Bible."
1802,5,I received this book as an advanced reading copy to review. this is by far the best book I have read in quite awhile . this is Catherine Andersons awesome writing with some great surprises thrown in ! I love this book and all the people in it . I am actually rereading it already as I just don't want it to end ! keep up the great writing Catherine !
1803,5,This is a super cute book and it has been a help in explaining to my 3 year old why I don't like getting woken up several times a night (as is usual).
1804,5,Great experience.  It was just what I wanted. I recieved the book quickly and it was in great condition. Thanks for the great experience.
1805,5,"Nice calendar, got it as a gift for someone and they were happy with it and the recipes it had included."
1806,5,"This is a gift for my husband for Valentines Day. He loves this author, so what a nice surprise for him. You might want to order this book at least 2-3 weeks in advance, it takes longer to receive."
1807,5,"Found this book to be a breath of air and light.  I appreciated its rawness.  In fact, I found that the book worked best for me when it was unfiltered.  This created an experience akin to peeking into someone's journal, revealing someone's intimate thoughts and processes.<br /><br />There is also a sense of urgency in a personal text.  This urgency says, &#34;write it down before I forget; write it down so that I may meditate on my experiences and can continue making the choices that best serve me in this moment.&#34;<br /><br />I picked the book up when I was feeling particularly stuck about work and life choices - and it helped!  It is always inspiring to be reminded of the infinite possibilities that our lives can take.<br /><br />In a more subtle takeaway, Erin Reese comes across as a seasoned traveler, who respectfully considers what it means to be a 'tourist' and 'traveler' outside of one's comfort zone. How does one experience a place without disrupting it? As all travelers know, this is immeasurably important.<br /><br />I won't lie.  If you are looking for a slick, polished travel guide with clear structure and format, this may not be your cup of tea.  No spoilers, but it perhaps ends a bit abruptly.<br /><br />However, if you are looking for some reflections from a conscious individual's personal journey - not to mention, a vast, vast amount of insider tips on real travel through India - give it a try!  For the nuts and bolts of traveling through India alone, it is worth the price of the book.<br /><br />Seeing Ms. Reese's intelligence and attention to detail in this thoughtful debut, I am excited to see what future turns, structures and expansions her writing will take.<br /><br />Happy reading and travels to everyone!"
1808,4,"The book itself is nice, but was of little help, I was hopeing for a more up to date book!"
1809,5,Mr. Brocci's  Pre-Graphing workbook really helps students achieve independence in solving these problems.  Students can easily follow the straightforward and self-guided practice.  Mr. Brocci's unique approach to solving equations (the egg system) is catchy and students love it!  Struggling students could follow the instructions and I could see their confidence soar.  For a math teacher this is priceless!

I've made many recipes from \\""Well Fed,\\"" and have loved all of them. Joulwan invites experimentation by giving suggestions for how to change up each recipe. Her introductory material has also been extremely helpful: I learned that preparation is the key to success, and it has really worked for me. I cannot recommend this book enough!"
1811,4,We buy this every other year. It's a wonderful help when doing crossword puzzles and checking out universities our grandkids are considering.
1812,5,The book came on time and it looks new. I rented it because I hate having to keep books after the semester is done. I'm very pleased with this purchase.
1813,5,"Vasilis Kanatas has written an authoritative and scholarly book which explains how the new 13-sign astrological system works in clear, easy-to-understand terms. I bought a copy here on Amazon and after reading it, I wondered why no-one had written much on the subject before. To my mind, this is a landmark achievement, and I comment as someone with over 25 years years experience using traditional 12-sign Western astrology, with a particular interest in progressive astrology and harmonics.<br />It is perhaps inevitable that this book will be unfairly dismissed by those who find it difficult to assimilate new ways of thinking, especially if it involves discounting one's own long-held beliefs and practises now that much has quickly become redundant. I must say, that I felt I had no option myself but to switch to a more realistic system rather than to just plod on with the previous inaccurate and therefore  unreliable one.<br />I spent nearly 20 years myself, trying to formulate my own 13-sign system, but I could never make it accurate enough, or bring it into alignment with the fact that the cusps all shift slightly each year.<br />Only someone with expertise in astronomy could have produced a system with the required level of scientific accuracy, and this lends the book a high degree of credibility.<br />This book had the effect of answering questions I was asking myself about 13-sign astrology for all these years, and by reading it, pieces of the puzzle suddenly fell into place - which was both enlightening and very exciting!<br />I thoroughly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the subject. Vasilis has not only defined the new approach but has also developed it into a fully-operational system. Check the website and you will discover many interesting articles and a free-calculator to determine your own new system Sun-sign - and you can also read weekly forecasts for each sign based on planetary positioning within the constellations as they appear on theecliptic in actuality, rather than as they would have done thousands of years ago in the past.<br />There is also useful information about the origins of astrology and how it got parted from astronomy.  Vasilis Kanatas does astrology a favour, seeking to save it from being total discredited and bringing it back into alignment with it's long-lost, more 'scientific' sister discipline.<br />I notice there is a comment here comparing the new theory to Indian Sidereal astrology (which is something I also happen to know quite a bit about). This comparison is unfortunately misleading and reflects that the reviewer hasn't properly grasped and understood the book. To call it 'an embarrassment' is also a little rude (which speaks for itself really).<br />I sincerely hope this review helps to clarify the content of the book, and gives it the careful consideration and praise it deserves."
1814,4,This book is super accurate but.... It needs to be updated. Its called a greatest hits collection and it falls short of encompassing all the songs the RHCP have made hits. If you are looking for just a few songs this will do fine. But if you are a real fan and want all their songs well it looks like you will have to buy a couple of books.
1815,5,arrived fast and in great shape.  I will not write long reviews.  Lost my original copy.  Thanks for this one
1816,5,"I read this cookbook as if it were a novel.  Have already smeared and spattered several pages.  Very readable.  Soothing at night when I can't sleep, inspiring when I am hungry and don't know what to make for dinner.  Thank You, Ms. Dahl."
1817,4,"I purchased this book after seeing the two main characters of the book interviewed on Mike Huckabee's TV show. It was a quick read but communicated effectively three important principles:<br />1. When you are prompted to stop your normal routine to help or respond to someone, act on the prompting. Acting on the impulse to help with improve you as much if not more so than the person who needs the help. As a Christian, I've learned the little voice in my head to call someone or visit someone is the Holy Spirit speaking to my heart.<br /><br />2. You get by giving. Laura gave to Maurice BUT she got much more in return from Maurice.<br /><br />3. The most important things Laura gave to Maurice were not what I expected. For example, he cherished the brown bag lunches she made for him to take to school instead of money to buy lunch. Having a bag lunch communicated to the kids at Maurice's school that someone loved him enough to take out of their day to make him lunch."
1818,4,"The interface between indigenous cultures and European expansionism and colonization has never been an easy one and this book provides insights into a series of episodes in early, post-revolution American history which pitted future president, William Henry Harrison against two remarkable Indian leaders and brothers, Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa, &#34;The Prophet&#34;. The latter two were aided and abetted by the British, still smarting over the loss of their former territories but they were also skilled readers and players of the developing political situation, recognizing above all the importance of larger alliances and numbers. As interfaces go, this is a fascinating account as, although the Indians ultimately lost much, these brothers were able to spoil and delay much of what has been planned as part of their fate. Highly recommended."
1819,4,"'Nightingale Woods' is Kathryn Brown's novel about being the 'other woman'. Written throughout in the first person - a clever device, as we see events solely from the other woman's point of view and can more readily empathise with her - it is a realistic story showing the pains, highs and lows of being involved with a married man. The narrator, Rachel, has intense chemistry with Steve, an older man whom she is convinced is the love of her life. We follow her history, beginning in the 1990s and the start of her affair with him. This part of the novel is written in diary form, which gives it great movement and pace. The spirit of the decade is captured in the language, the music and the wine. Because the reader is inside Rachel's head we see her doubts and guilt, which makes her sympathetic. I found Steve less so, but his motivations were also always shown and the stakes involved were always clearly stated.<br /><br />The second part of the novel shows their affair rekindled after a long interval. The time between is explained and Rachel's increased age and life experience are well drawn. This part, written in first person but not as a diary, shows Rachel embedded in her new life and, as a contrast, the committed love of her friends Claire and Melanie.<br /><br />Throughout, the 'symbol' of Rachel's and Steve's love is the Nightingale Woods and these, too, are not left unscathed.<br /><br />This was a different read, involving and very brave."
1820,5,a little book you can read through in a sitting but will want to review again and again. The how-to section went right up next to my computer.
1821,1,"What a useless book!  Recycled gossip from many books that tell the same stories more eloquently and with more historic context.  For example, the Mary Martin chapter is 90% about her career, 8% about being a lesbian and 2% about her Palm Springs connection.  The book is also marred with many misspellings.  The LGBT history of Palm Springs still deserves to be told."
1822,5,"I learned how to cover with film the right way by reading this book.  In fact, the reason I'm on the page for it is that I'm about to recommend it.<br /><br />Like any sort of fine finishing, you can't just read the techniques in this book and go do a prize-winning covering job -- you still have to do a lot of learning on your own.  But this book will plant your feet firmly on the road to doing well."
1823,5,"A hip, offbeat and unique coloring book for kids and grownup designers alike. Tons of wide-open illustrations that leave room for your own hues & patterns. Fun!"
1824,5,A must-have for any student of interpersonal process therapy. Teyber is easy to read and implement in your practice. I love it!
1825,5,Very good book!  A must read!  I think one of Grisham&#34;s best yet.I would highly suggest this as a very good read.
1826,5,"I have gotten so much information from this book. If you are in to crystals and healing stones, this book is the best I've seen. it has so much information packed into a small paperback. You will love it too."
1827,5,"Bill O'Reilly has done it again.  Very informative book not only on the assignation but on the years preceding it.  Being a small boy when this happened, I learned so much more than I knew before.  Thanks, Bill."
1828,5,"Excellent book, great photo's and well made. Comprhensive look at the making of all Dark Knight films as well as lots of behind the scenes stuff."
1829,4,"The outside of book is in great condition. The service was prompt, but the inside of the book is torn, which it didn't say on the description.  Happy about the immediate delivery"
1830,5,"My 4 year old nephew loves the froggy series i bought this book to add to his ever growing collection of books, he has a total of 3 froggy books, which i  bought for him, he loves the books and never tires of them, his little sister, 2 years old, also enjoys the books.<br />The book is smaller than i thought it would be but thats okay the kids are happy with  the books and they werent expensive!<br /><br />The froggy books are fun to read to kids, they arent boring and they have nice colorful pictures."
1831,5,"I could not put this down. I have always been fascinated with cults and religions, wondering why people irrationally believe things in the face of facts that disprove the dogma. This story is well researched and was written by L Wright who won a Pulitzer Prize for his last book, The Looming Tower, about al Queda and the lead up to 9/11. Going Clear reminds me of the beginnings of Mormonism, which was on the road to destruction until they mainstreamed the doctrine and some practices by eliminating polygamy and removing writings condemning black Americans. If Miscavage, who evidently rules by fear, intimidation and violence, wants to see this 'religion' survive there needs to be some major changes internally. It appears that there are some redeeming philosophies and practices that do some a world of good in Scientology, but then, if not a member of Celebrity Hollywood, it quickly becomes a dark and scary quicksand dragging you into a nightmare beyond belief. Read this and be amazed at what goes on under the guise of America's newest 'religion.'"
1832,5,"GREAT REFERENCE WORK.  MANY MORE SUCH REFERENCE BOOKS SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR HIGH SCHOOL, COLLEGE, AND UNIVERSITY POST GRADUATE STUDENTS."
1833,5,"My only disappointment with this book was that it ended all too soon; I wished there had been 700 more pages.  White provides an unbiased, thoughtful and interesting context around the facts and writings of Lincoln.  He provides the background of events and helps give insights into what Lincoln must have been feeling through his tragedies (loss of office, loss of children, war) and his triumphs.<br /><br />I found it to be the kind of book I wanted to read in every spare moment I could find.  It is academically strong, interesting to read and elicits empathetic joy and sorrow."
1834,4,"Originally posted in [...]<br />I was dubious about reading this book, mainly because I did an online research about Nouwen's life and finally found out that even though he respected his celibacy until his death he was struggling with homosexuality. Yet, I know He is respected among christians as a great teacher about spirituality and it's not my intention to diminish his teaching or his life purpose.<br /><br />With that being said, The Way of the Heart is about the story of the desert fathers (you can read more on Wikipedia), those who chose to run to the desert shortly after persecution ended in the Roman Empire and christianity was the official religion during Constantine's reign.<br /><br />But this is not only a history class, Nouwen focuses on the practices that these \\""fathers\\"" and \\""mothers\\"" experimented during his life in the desert: solitude, silence and prayer.<br /><br />All these practices are more famous or recognized among roman catholics, more accurately among monks and nuns in monasteries, enclosed in meditation and prayer. That doesn't mean they're not practical or useful for christians, in fact this practices are remembered and explained by Nouwen and how they can be applied in our daily lives,  whether you're a minister or just a church member.<br /><br />I won't go any deeper with the book content, but I must say that I found myself a little bit confused and concerned when Nouwen quoted a Taoist philosopher and the practices of Zen, even though they're used as examples or analogies.<br /><br />I reccomend this book to those christians that are trying to go deeper into their relationship with God and are willing to develop or adopt spiritual disciplines and are rooted in a sound doctrine.<br /><br />I do not reccomend this book to new born christians, which easily will get lost or confused with teachings on meditation and contemplation. I personally believe that new believers need to feed primarly on basic teachings first."
1835,4,This is a subject that takes some work and forethought to really see how deliverance from Demons works. When you aren't used in this way it's good to see how someone else is being used to help others get free of the things that torment their minds and lives.  It would be good for anyone that knows they need some help to let go of past issues and be free to be who they really are!
1836,2,"I agree with most of the reviews, this book in particular was too filled with sex. I like the mystery, I love the politics with a sprinkling of sex. I also grow weary of her repeatedly explaining the same thing over and over again. I know she was raised by her father and I know she visited the Goblin kingdom many times, I know the rules she keeps explaining over and over again. Get to the point."
1837,5,"All the negative reviews seem to swirl around the bloated or weak nature of the concrete ideas. I'm sure he's open to attack here, variously. Taleb is strenuously exercising via arguments, using a massively entertaining series of analyses--almost all of which have considerable merit. And even practical applicability. And he's not boring. But he's all over the place, a little confusingly, and a little wonderfully, when you reflect. He's basically unchallenged by \\""real\\"" intellectuals lately out of animal fear that they'll be humiliated in front of the tribe, which is saying something.<br /><br />In a real sense his Amazon critics are his most hated enemies--people with an academic bent who despise his overall style, or financial people looking for something \\""useful.\\"" He's definitely actively hating on those people in his writing, which you rarely see with quasi-castrated tenured types, or the standardized editorial tone of NY \\""idea\\"" publishing. Reminds me of H.L. Mencken and generally surly intellectuals of previous epochs, entertainingly.<br /><br />You can certainly argue with how his notions apply to real life, and get annoyed with him, but his digressions keep me awake, even if his ideas might be arguably \\""flawed.\\""<br /><br />Taleb's dismissal of Pinker's recent violence book was notably weak to me, though, since I'm a big fan of Pinker. Not sure how sighing in exasperation is an adequate response to 800 pages written by one of the smartest humans alive, but...hey. Pinker's analysis doesn't really fit into Taleb's concepts. Here you see Taleb might be ensconced in his own rectum, and he's no time, necessarily, to emerge to do rational or effective battle. Doesn't fit with his ebb and flow.<br /><br />5 stars anyway, all the other books are boring and without significance or original thought, mostly. I don't think I could recommend it more. It's a great reading experience, it's compulsive, funny and alive in ways most pseudo-systematic modern \\""idea\\"" writing isn't.You might see serious flaws in his intellectual compulsions, but they're all intellectually-and-actually entertaining."
1838,5,"I love Alan's ability to help us understand that God will meet us where we are in our journey to a more loving relationship with our Saviour. The evil one would trick us with all kinds of guilt and shame but we are reminded that God sees his children thru His Son.  As our minds eye Iooks outside thru a sparkling clean window on a sunny winters day we are blinded by a soft reflection off the pure, white snow.....then we realize, God willingly allows His own blindness, ignoring our history of mistakes and sees only the pure and permeating light of his Son!"
1839,4,"Boundless is the much anticipated finale to the Unearthly series, and it mostly doesn't disappoint. Clara, Angela, and Christian have all started their first year at Stanford where Angela's vision has led them. Little do they know just how dangerous her vision turns out to be, and how little of it actually takes place on campus. Things almost immediately get really intense, and I don't mean their course loads! Angela finds herself in a predicament that will change all of their lives forever.<br /><br />As I said in my review for Radiant, Angela's role is definitely larger. I loved seeing more of her, even though she's not her usual upbeat, snarky self. She has some huge life changes coming up, and I could only hope that it ended well for her. Of course, there is a happy ending, but it takes a lot of pain and struggle to get there even with the help of her two best friends.<br /><br />Clara is continuing to rework her sense of identity throughout Boundless from learning to live without her mom, choosing a major and career path, and reevaluating her purpose. It turns out that is has nothing to do with what she original though, and I enjoyed that twist. It was definitely unexpected, but it makes sense given everything that has happened. She also grows as a person and comes into her angelic powers. I really enjoyed learning more about all she can do, despite not being the biggest angel fan.<br /><br />The romance takes a back seat to the action in this one. You may think that Clara and Christian will be all over each other now that they're in college together, but nope. Everything keeps getting in the way of their budding romance, and then of course, there's Tucker. Clara is obviously not over him, much to Christians disappointment. I think the author did an amazing job with the love triangle. It didn't dominate the larger plot, and it felt natural, not forced.<br /><br />All in all, I really enjoyed this ending to the series. I did get teary eyed near the end, but it didn't bring the water works like Hallowed did. I also found some of the resolutions a little cheesy and convenient. I was hoping for a heart stopping finish, but things were a little too neatly tied up. The epilogue was really cute though, and even though it was a little disappointing, I think it was the right ending.idn't bring the water works like Hallowed did.

1840,5,Bought this for my husband and then wanted to hog reading it.  So funny!!  Definitely recommend for just an entertaining read.
1841,5,"For anyone interested in fine cooking, this is an essential. Not much of a recipe book, although it has many recipes within. Most importantly, it explains concepts and methods that will stand to help any cook, not matter how sophisticated or experience he or she is.<br /><br />Buy it and read it, then experiment with the recipes there or modify your favorite recipes using the knowledge learned from this book and you will be able to create your own signature dishes for when family gets together."
1842,5,it was bought as a gift. it must have been a good choice. the trilogy is now beeing passed around from sister to sister. aunt to aunt friend to friend.
1843,5,Another great story about the icy northern wastes. Well worth a read if you are into exploration and the endeavors of these hardy explorers.
1844,5,I have purchased many of the series.  Try it for yourself you won't be disappointed.  You won't want to put it down.
1845,4,My daughter - in college - thinks this book is quite useful. Glad she does - as the professor gave her little choice about it as her textbook.
1846,5,Excellent books. Like it so much I bought more as gifts and everyone I bought them for agrees that it is an inspiring book
1847,5,"This is a great book for daily devotionals.  My brother recommended it to me ad even though this was written over 50 years ago, Amy Carmichael had some wonderful insights to the Scriptures.  I would highly recommend it!"
1848,5,"Had bought one of these books at a store , and my aunt loved it so much I gave it to her and ordered mine here.  Lots of easy sewing projects."
1849,5,I bought this as a Christmas present for a friend who happens to be a &#34;Travis Thrasher&#34; fan. She loves this book as much as the others if not more.<br /><br />Recommend!
1850,5,A very concise history of the conception and ideas behind the creation of the largest known amusement venue in the world.  The book contains a wealth of information including a lot of information about the artistry that went into creating the Disney properties.
1851,5,"The fact that the book come with the light and have song, make this book unique and fun to read. My 11 months old keep giving me this book so I can sing along with it."
1852,4,"This book by the English film critic Raymond Durgnat remains, after some 40 years, the best book available in English on Renoir's films, life and writings. That includes the French books about Renoir that have been translated into English, including the book by Truffaut/Bazin.<br /><br />It would probably most appeal to someone who has seen a number of Renoir's films, perhaps even several times, and was starting to formulate thoughts about how they relate to each other.<br /><br />It's also a nice antidote to the received opinions about Renoir that have been unquestioned and repeated for years by lazy film critics, both American and French.  Much like the \\""canned\\"" ideas and cliches Renoir himself was always warning about."
1853,5,"As a Java developer I've been using plenty of web frameworks over recent years. Every single of them was either using JSP, or was built on the top of Servlets or at least required some configuration in deployment descriptor. Even though I felt quite productive, there have always been present these little things that kept bothering me. If you often happen to see stack traces ending somewhere in servlet classes you know what I am talking about. After some time I realized that it might be good idea to dive into the basics and try to understand the pillar stones of the specification that many frameworks utilize. So I got this book.<br /><br />The book is extremely well structured and the order of chapters makes perfect sense. Each chapter starts with gentle introduction to the problem, properly describes the most important use cases of the core components and ends up with fine-grained details that you might refer to in the future. Chapters have very reasonable length and provided examples are clear. With correct zoom even the Kindle version has proper formatting, which seems (unfortunately) kinda rare in tech books.<br /><br />The only thing that was disturbing me was that author was using fully-qualified class names in API descriptions, even for java.lang.String or java.util.List. But overall impression of the book was very good so I easily forgave author this little annoyance and focused on the content instead."
1854,4,"Lev Grossman's plot for The Magicians centers around the students at a hidden school of magic in the modern day, obviously mimicking the Harry Potter story; and then the students (now graduated) gain entry to an alternate world which is a Narnia knock-off. Grossman is obviously covering the fantasy bases. He also includes bits from the Oz books, Alice in Wonderland, John Crowley's Little, Big, and I'm sure from others which I didn't catch. Consequently, the book jacket hype and many reviews cast this novel as an adult Harry Potter, and unwary readers expect to be transported to a magical world of conventional fantasy, with its good versus evil escapism. Boy, are they in for a surprise.<br /><br />Lev Grossman is up to something else entirely here. This is postmodern fantasy, you might say, with its students of magic being intellectually pretentious, jealous and snarky, chronically bored and unhappy, prone to excessive drinking and irresponsible sex. The focus is not on the fantasy elements (with none of those \\""thick\\"" details that make Hogwarts and Narnia believable worlds), but on the angst of the characters, particularly of Quentin Coldwater, the central figure.<br /><br />Quentin is unhappy at his home in Brooklyn, even though he is an intellectual \\""shining star\\"" who is most surely about to be accepted to Princeton. Then he is recruited by a secret school for budding magicians, and it seems to him to be a dream come true. But then he is not completely happy there either. Something is still missing. He graduates. What to do next? He drinks a lot and betrays his girlfriend, who seems to be the one person who actually unselfishly cares for him. His childhood fantasy comes true when he finds that he can actually enter Fillory (patterned on Narnia). He believes that he can finally be happy there. But no. Etc.<br /><br />I find this novel to be patterned more after Jonathan Lathem's Fortress of Solitude or Donna Tartt's The Secret History than on fantasy novels. I evenperceive the influence of F. Scott Fitzgerald. All of these authors feature intellectually superior protagonists who can't manage to be happy. I have never quite decided what the message is supposed to be here. That highly intelligent, sensitive souls are so above the rest of us that they are destined always to be seekers for happiness, never finding it?<br /><br />Despite all this criticism on my part, I found the novel to be riveting. I stayed up late and woke up early to read it. Grossman can make you turn those pages, for sure."
1855,5,"This is a wonderful book (audio). I bought it for my husband for Christmas and absolutely loved it! He thought it was very sad in places but came away with a better understanding of Paul, his life, and the beatles."
1856,5,"Author Canon Fredrick Frost was my great grandfather and I grew up hearing stories of his missionary work among the native people on the Mantitoulin Is.  He was a dedicated man of faith who mastered the Ojibway language to better share the love of God with them.  He translated their hymn and prayer books into Ojibway so they could more fully join in celebrations.  He and my great grandmother were the Godparents for many, many young Indian children. He gave his life to his work and family and this book tells many stories of his adventures, the people and the amazing fortitude of the people living on the Manitoulin in the late 1800's.  As you read, you feel that you are sitting around a campfire listening to a great storyteller who sincerely cared for his own family and his new family of first nations friends. If you are interested in the life, culture and native spirituality of the Ojibway as well as the life of a missionary Priest and Teacher, you will enjoy this book."
1857,4,I'm convinced that Michael Lewis can make any subject interesting.  But his years of experience on Wall Street gave him the knowledge to ask the right questions and focus on the important economic issues.  His chapters on Iceland and Greece are must reads.
1858,5,"I first read this book 8 years ago. And I still refer it, read it, wonder about Vimalananda  & Robert Svoboda, find my-self in their company except I can not talk to them and ask them questions. Takes us to the wonderful magical world. I hope I will catch and meet Robert svoboda in person some day and ask him too many questions I have."
1859,5,I've read and done the exercises for every chapter.  It's a good book.  I like visuals and this book is all text and numbers.  No video.
1860,5,"I think a lot of the negative reviews are basically irrelevant and are based on just the DVDs and not the \\""meat\\"" of the program which is the workbooks and the readers.  I absolutely love this program.  My 6 year old has been a very reluctant reader but this got her reading.  It was a great combination of words without pictures (so they can't guess) and then words with illustrations (to hold their interest).  I love that all I have to do is open a book, work through it with her and then close it.  There's no prep whatsoever, and enough variety with content to hold her attention.<br /><br />I do think there could be a few improvements.  I would love \\""helper words\\"" flashcards.  The one page with the helper words isn't enough, and my daughter would memorize the colors but not the words. You can make your own, but still it would be nice.<br /><br />Also the DVDs are useless.  We don't even use them since they're more \\""edutainment\\"" than anything.  My kids don't learn from watching DVDs like that, nor do I really appreciate videos being passed as education.  I think kids learn better from interaction.<br /><br />The only other drawback is that I didn't think there was quite enough practice for my daughter.  You may need to repeat some of the sections.  But every kid is different and that's an issue with any curriculum.<br /><br />Overall it's a GREAT product.  Even with the drawbacks it's still 5 stars in my book.  I absolutely love Hooked on Phonics and recommend it to everyone."
1861,5,"This is a superbly written piece that guides the reader on a journey toward ancient wisdom, and invites members of the Craft to explore their esoteric roots, symbols, and traditions beyond the rudimentary explanations contained in modern ritual. Whether you are a newly minted EA or a PM sporting a 50-year lapel pin, this book is relevant for Masons of all ages and experience. Well done WB Herd."
1862,5,"Was a great read, and a great addition to my collection, will most certianly read this one over again and again!!!"
1863,5,The book received inside of the features provided by the seller.<br />The book was received within the time frame estimated at perfect condition.<br />The content of the book is excellent quality.
1864,4,"Unusual, but this is a book of popularizing economics for the lay person.<br /><br />The thesis of this book, expressed in it's final sentence, is that great leaders solve crises.  Thus, for much of the book,  we follow James Pierpoint Morgan while he and others dealt with the banking and financial crisis of 1907 as it manifested itself in New York City, on Wall Street October into November 1907. Sketches of the course of the 1907 Crash (first part of the book) and the 2007 Crash (third part of the book) are given.  Parallels of both cause and solutions to the banking and financial crises of 1907 and 2007 are presented and explained for the lay person.  The authors show how seven factors (complexity, buoyant growth, inadequate safety buffers, adverse leadership, real economic shock, undue fear, greed, and other behavioral aberrations and failure of collective action) manifested themselves in both crises of 1907 and in 2007.  Much of the book (the second part, nearly 2/3 of the entire book) has to do with the leadership of James Pierpoint Morgan at the crux of the crisis on Wall Street, New York, October into November 1907.  In this second part of the book we have a paean of praise for JP Morgan, well and entertainingly written and detailed.  Some blame for both crises is thrown  onto the government officials in both eras. At points the authors state the need for government intervention in the financial world, and at other points the authors cast blame on the government officials for the crises.<br /><br />The book is clearly written, obviously for the non economist, with many terms explained in footnotes. It is definitely not a heavy economic tome and the specialists in economics should probably stay clear. The reading level is accessible to the knowledgeable college graduate.  The chapters are short and concise giving good snapshots of causes, effects, leadership, and solutions to the two financial crises, suggesting that other crises may be similar.  I am not an economist theorist, but the authors do make reference to Keynes \\""animal spirits\\"" and show how those spirits were manifest on Wall Street, October into November 1907, and again in 2007.<br /><br />Because of the emphasis on demonstrating the leadership of JP Morgan, this is not a good history of the entire worldwide crisis 1906 through 1908 financial crisis and panic.  To the credit of the authors, the drama on Wall Street, October into November 1907 is well displayed."
1865,5,"This is an outstanding book. It explores the evolutionary and biological roots of fear, while delivering an engaging and personal narrative about the author's own struggles to overcome his fears of big wave surfing and intimacy. It is a must read for anyone who has suffered from anxiety or allowed self-doubt to prevent them from going after their most lofty goals... Oh, that would be everyone!"
1866,3,"Fear! Distressing emotion of impending dangers, terror for the novice spirit medium, written to introduce the reader to the field of exorcism and the dangers of demon possession. These things do happen and must be reckon with. A good series of short stories along with answers, and precautionary notes and spiritual warfare prayers to the invisible world of spirit demons."
1867,2,"I've been in the market for a new job for awhile and recently decided to see if there was any market for my favorite past job - assembler programming.  There is, a bit...  This morning, I started researching what's going on in the area and came across this book.<br /><br />I was looking for updated resume formats, cover letters in the new \\""style.\\""  No.  This is a very short, generalized book (more of a long article) on hiring any kind of a programmer.  There are chapters for the job seeker, the hiring manager and the recruiter.  There is not any kind of special focus on mainframe programming.<br /><br />There are many other general job hunting books out there that cover the material better."
1868,5,"D-Day  has become the most important battle of World War II in the minds of many of todays Western Citizens.  It insured that the Western allies would do their full part in destroying Hitler's Germany.  This is the most detailed book I have found about this day.  It is arranged like an encyclopedia,  with every subject covered just like subjects are covered in the World Book.  This has advantages and disadvantages.  If you Know exactly what topic you want, you just look it up.  If you do not know what exact topic you need to look up, you will have to browse thru the book.  Still- the best single book about D-Day."
1869,5,"I bought the book based on the wrap on the cover, there are quite a few other patterns in the book that I would make.  The book is organized by difficulty rating, each pattern building on the skills learned in the pattern before it.  Tunisian crochet is experiencing a surge in popularity, this book does not disappoint."
1870,5,"Part of a series, Connor Grey has problems with a vengeful Queen of Faerie, a string of murders, and the mysterious return of his old Guild partner.  For more than 100 years, Faerie and the modern world converged.  The ways between the worlds have been closed...someone wants them open again.  It is a darn good read."
1871,5,Easy Read and breaks down different topics well. Makes certain points easy to understand. I recommend getting this book if you are pursuing a CCNA degree. I bought I used book and the quality was good.
1872,5,It was really had for me to get into the first book but I'm so glad I finished it. By the end I really cared about what happened to the  characters and what would happen next.  The following book and The Hammer of God were exceptional and exciting.
1873,5,I thoroughly enjoyed the book and learned a lot about how to deal with dogs.  I gave it to a friend who was adopting a wolf hybrid and I both regret it and am glad I did.<br /><br />I'm glad I did because he needs to know what's in this book.  It's informative and relavent.<br /><br />I regret it because I've lost some of the skills and ideas from this book and I'd like to get them back.  I may have to buy another copy...
1874,5,My son was featured in the book as he was cook at Waldemar for some time and many of his vrecipes are included in the book.  This was a Christmas present for him.
1875,5,I always love the Gary Patterson calendars.  He has such a delightful sense of humor.  In this world humor is needed
1876,4,Fast services with postage and item was as described. Can't ask for more. I highly recommend doing business with them
1877,5,Lots of twists and turns as usual.  Very good fast read.  The only thing that would have made  this book better would  have been its access on my Kindle.
1878,5,"Easy to read and understand, based on observation and thinking.  Rational antidote to collectivist rationalizations.  Rejects altruism and demonstrates the virtue of free men and free markets in contrast to government regulations that cripple the mind."
1879,5,My parents gave me this as a High School graduation gift and I still have it many years later.  I purchased one for each of my children and am having each of their teachers sign it as they grow.  We will give it to the kids when they graduate with 12 encouraging notes from their teachers and a special note from us!
1880,5,"I read \\""Labour of Love\\"" after reading the first two novels of this trilogy.  I have to say I enjoyed this one even more than the other two, which were both excellent novels.  Knowing that in real life, Doug Wilson, spent his last days writing a tender hearted account of his lover's death while he himself was dying, made this novel all the more poignant for me.  Some of the professional reviews have called this a triumph of the human spirit.  I could not agree more.<br /><br />If you enjoyed either of the other two novels in the trilogy, I believe you will probably like this one even though it's clear that a different person wrote \\""Labour of Love\\"".  There are plenty of funny moments here.  The novel definitely does take a few zany, madcap turns.  Still, there is slightly less of that than in the other two novels.  That worked fine for me personally.  I think many others will react in the same way and feel genuinely touched by this story."
1881,5,I really liked the book it was a very interesting one about all the people in the town and the different parts of their lives
1882,5,iread the book before so I had bought as a christmas gift very fun reading well done any thing by tim burton is great big fan
1883,5,Purchsed this for my mother in law who is a long time resident of the area.  She really enjoyed learning (and/or being reminded of) the personalities and events that shaped the area.  It has lots of great photos too.  She's shared the book with friends and it's been a great discussion starter.
1884,3,"The book is fine. Should be called Knit your Own Monster, but otherwise the instructions are clear AND good projects for scrap yarn."
1885,5,"This is a pretty shocking book. Very well researched, good for academic use, it details the history, mostly since the Civl War up until the 1970s, of peonage. I hadn't heard the term before except as an insult, and had no idea of its long abusive history in the South. Its no surprise why blacks have so much animosity toward whites, especially in the South. This book takes up the \\""bloody shirt\\"" and keeps on going. Related books you might be interested in if you are going to research the South soon after the Civl War are Du Bose Heyward's \\""Mamba's Daughters,\\"" Alex Garland's \\""Tesseract\\"" for peonages appearance in the Philippines, Thomas Wallace Know's \\""Camp-fire and Cotton-Field: Southern Adventure in Time of War\\"" free on gutenberg, Scott Reynolds Nelson's \\""Steel Drivin' Man: John Henry: the Untold Story of an American Legend\\"" and for that bloody shirt, Stephen Budiansky's \\""The Bloody Shirt: Terror After the Civil War.\\"" In an attempt to find a \\""five star review\\"" for the South, I'm reading William Alexander Percy's \\""Lanterns on the Levee\\"" to see if I can find some beauty in relation to the races therein. Also, leading up to the War, I recommend Steven Channing's \\""Crisis of Fear\\"" and W. J. Cash's \\""The Mind of the South.\\"" Those two are anything but positive about the South, but honestly, I do have some very good feelings for Florida and South Carolina. So maybe things have finally changed. The Sea Islands are lovely. Oh, yes, for those a terrific book is Theodore Rosengarten's \\""Tombee.\\"" Also, a great read about South Carolina in regards to slavery is Edward Ball's \\""Slaves in the Family.\\"" So many good books, so little time."
1886,5,It was Very helpful.  It's good to know there are other women out there who feel the way I do.  Thanks!
1887,5,"Is the Jungian philosophy of the collective unconscious the first thing that comes to mind when someone mentions the apocalypse? For most people, perhaps not, but the startlingly original ideas fermenting in minds like Jon Michael Kelley's are what produce novels as uniquely compelling as Seraphim.<br />Kelley's novel is part apocalypse, part study of Man, part philosophy, part horror, and part fantasy (packaged with a delightfully subtle wrapping of humor). Like many battles between good and evil, the story involves beings of light and darkness. However, whereas many writers stay too comfortably within the lines of good and evil for my taste, Kelley blurs, bends, breaks, and subverts them. For example, Eli Kagan is a priest and thus we assume he must be of the light--but not so fast. As with all of Kelley's writing, things are not always what they seem. Children, supposedly innocent and carefree, are critical elements in the showdown over the fate of humanity. Angels, entities of pure righteousness, have learned to be the avenging angels of human imagination. Therein lies the dark, complex heart of Kelley's story. The narrative rests on the concept of the collective unconscious and humanity's vital, active, and twisted imagination. From the beginnings of recorded time mankind has created our own visions of good and evil. Yet like the classic first Star Trek film, V'Ger has started to develop a sense of its own existence. The children created and sustained within our minds want the right to exist and grow beyond that limited space.<br /><br />This is a complex tale that keeps readers challenged and engaged right to the end. Kelley has a wonderful ability to turn a phrase and the novel is full of seductively lyrical language and imagery (\\""memories glimpsed like vestiges of sunlight cast between the whirling blades of a windmill...\\""). He makes the apocalypse sound so inviting that at times I wondered exactly which side I was really on. There is no bad and good, black and white, heaven and hell, or simple answers. Read, ponder, and savor the subtle shades in-between.and white, heaven and hell, or simple answers. Read, ponder, and savor the subtle shades in-between."
1888,5,"Good quality. I had read this book from a colleague, its real funny especially for the people with sick humor."
1889,5,Enjoyable and cute. I have read several of Kaitin O'Riley's books and they all put a smile on my face.
1890,5,I take classes from an Iyengar instructor.  This book is a great help for my at home practice.  The pictures are wonderful and the descriptions are almost exactly the same as my instructor.  It has improved my yoga practice tremendously.
1891,4,"This book is enjoyable for fans of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books and/or movies. It was originally published after the first movie was released, and has been updated to include details from the second and third movies. I would definitely recommend it, and I think even kids who aren't into the series but who have an interest in movies or film making would enjoy it!"
1892,4,"When I read, within the first sentenced of the 'forward', two or three naughty words, I was sold. When Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden was mentioned in the very first sentence of the first chapter, I knew this would be my new favorite! I absolutely loved the story line of this book. I had to keep reminding myself that it wasn't a true story. I love the adventure, as I always have. Even better, the footnotes at the bottom of the pages give you good laughs and they make you wonder! Who would have known that the jackalope is based off of rabbits infected with Shope Pappilomavirus!? Being a taxidermist, this was awesome information! Get ready to finish this book in one day, like I did, because it's near impossible to put it down!"
1893,5,"Full of Christmas stories, writings, history. Love this book.  We read the Christmas story out of it every year on Christmas Eve."
1894,4,"I have a 15 yo old high functioning autism/aspergers.  When he was little, I'd set these goals for speech and doing well in school and having conversations and think that when he met them, he'd be well on his way to having a normal, happy, productive life.<br /><br />But after he met and surpassed those goals, the anxiety remained, and I realized how much the underlying anxiety has been crippling him all along.<br /><br />The book is a dry but interesting read with many points that really resonated with me, like those made about the false beliefs and distorted thoughts that cause stress in Aspies.<br /><br />However, it's not really a step by step guide to successful stress management that parents or teens can use, but rather a survey of research and treatment options, including some fringy, new-age philosophizing, coupled with the author's own personal experiences managing stress."
1895,5,"I've been a fan of not only James Patterson, but also Max since I read When the wind blows.  Going to be using this character and Patterson books in my classroom for a long time!"
1896,4,Very useful on a recent trip in which we purposely stayed off of Interstates as much as possible. Helpful ideas on special points of interest.
1897,5,"These books are great for young kids.  They are informative, full of illustrations.  To bad they don't print them in hardback anymore."
1898,5,"This story is incredible. Easy to forget it is actually non-fiction and how well Bryan came out on the other side. To do so takes a strong individual and I give him a lot of credit!<br />I thought it was very well written, easy to read and kept me guessing! I've already passed it along to my family members who raved about it to!"
1899,5,"This cookbook is very informative and contains lots of useful, unique recipes.  We are excited to begin using it and do recommend it to anyone."
1900,5,"Amil Imani writes with scrupulous attention to facts, which he carefully documents to the reader's benefit. His knowledge of the Persian Gulf conflict...the players and the power politics involved with every decision and every move... makes this book riveting. If he were not a writer, he could well have been a history professor!<br /><br />Joan Swirsky"
1901,5,"When they were children, Bruce Millikan teased Flora Saferight unmercifully.  She hated his barbs and was elated when he left their Quaker town.<br /><br />Bruce is back to Flora's disgust as she still feels the pain of his unkind words mimicked by others; he regrets what he did to her.  Flora and her sister Irene are taking a train to visit their aunt and uncle in Charlottesville.  Pastor John wants to use the siblings as cover so that Bruce can escort a runaway slave couple via the Underground Railroad to Pennsylvania; the female is pregnant so Flora's midwife skills are also needed.  Using a quilt as their guide, the journey proves less dangerous than expected except for one near deadly mistake and the effect on the respective hearts of Flora and Bruce.<br /><br />The latest fabulous Quilts of Love inspirational (see A Wild Goose Chase Christmas by Jennifer AlLee and Beyond the Storm by Carolyn Zane) is a delightful historical romance starring two beloved enemies who find their souls freed to love by the brave deeds they do together.  The quilt guiding their passage on the Underground Railroad enhances a strong tale of to forgive is divine.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner"
1902,4,"gave it to my brother when he started using kettlebells for his work outs.  he's been on kettlebell routines for a long time now, so im thinking he likes the book and what he's geting out of the exercises"
1903,5,"Hilarious! I couldn't put this book down until it was done, then I read it again! Easily one of the best books written by a comedian."
1904,4,"Ms. Surface gets it.  These pieces aren't perfect but they do their job: provide a young person with material where they can make choices and transitions, and be honest in dramatic situations.  I'm working with my daughter on one of the monologues in this book for a middle school audition.  At first, the 45 second piece seemed straightforward, but in breaking it down we've been able to find plenty of dimensions.  I recommend this book."
1905,5,"My doctor recommended this book.  I have chronic back pain and by following the proper stretches in this book, I can alleviate my own pain.  I do these recommended exercises all of the time."
1906,5,"I would recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about all of the presidents. I am homeschooling my granddaughter and I have to come up with new and creative ways to hold her interest! When she read in another book about a certain &#34;chubby&#34; president needing help to get out of his bath tub, she wanted to see if there were interesting (funny) facts about any other presidents! She is dyslexic, so we've been reading it together, and I'm either learning some new things or relearning some old things I've forgotten! It is learning made fun and easy!"
1907,5,I ordered it for my daughter for Christmas as she had some old coins and was excited to go through them and find how much they were worth.
1908,5,Bought the book as a gift.  Have not had the opportunity to read it as of yet.  Hopefully the person will allow me to borrow it.
1909,5,"Agnes Sanford's how-to book is easily readable and provides guidance that is clear, understandable & enlightening, as well as timely."
1910,5,Anyone who has witnessed the influence that political agendas and power has on the reported &#34;truth&#34; that is promulgated and incorporated into religious dogma or even promoted by the media (FOX propaganda?) and has become cynical and doubtful will celebrate this story. Sadly many have thrown the baby out with the bath water and the fundamentalists have so deluded themselves and confused and wounded so many young people that it will take many more folks such as Spong and in this case Meyers to reveal the real Jesus that has been lost due to political and religious dogma. This book will be helpful for setting Jesus free and also for helping in recovering the man behind the myth and also the followers of Jesus that are not &#34;Christians.&#34;
1911,2,"I don't know why I expected this book to be good, unless it's just the questionable assumption that any book that gets made into a movie must be good. When I started reading it I hadn't even seen all the rave reviews of it here&mdash;with not a single one-star rating out of 44, which is remarkable for ANYTHING at Amazon.<br /><br />I hadn't actually planned to read the book. I borrowed the [[ASIN:B000A88EVE Criterion Collection DVD boxed set]] from the library to watch the movie (which I've never seen); a copy of the novel was in the box with the DVDs, and I started reading it first.<br /><br />Somewhere I recently read some professional critic's opinion that The Man Who Fell to Earth (I don't remember whether it was the book or the movie) is memorable mainly for its portrayal of alcoholism, and I think I agree (about the book, anyway: I still haven't and now probably won't watch the movie, since everyone says the book is much better except David Bowie fans, which I'm not). Unfortunately, I have no interest in alcoholism or empathy with alcoholics.<br /><br />To read about a vulnerable alien, entrusted with the survival of his race, who destroys himself and betrays his mission because he's a drunk does not elicit sympathy from me. To me, he's a fool&mdash;like all alcoholics&mdash;not an object of pity. I know that's an unfashionable attitude, but it fits every single alcoholic I've ever known personally; alcoholism has never looked like a disease to me, and I'm not able to absolve alcoholics of responsibility for the destruction they always cause somebody.<br /><br />As a work of science fiction, this book seems to me an almost total failure. The only things that qualify it as science fiction are its setting in the future (from the author's point of view, although it's now in our past), its alien protagonist and the moderately advanced technology he brings with him to Earth. It fails mainly because Tevis was so determined that the world be OUR world just a few years in the future&mdash;not safely thousands of years in the future or \\""in a galaxy long ago and far away\\"".<br /><br />When he proves so wrong about his own near future (our past), his credentials as a visionary (practically essential for a good writer of science fiction) are shattered. Reading that movie theatres would still show newsreels, that air conditioning would still be innovative and exceptional, that people would still be using wooden pencils, and that an annual income of $80,000 would still seem astronomical in the 1980s makes the book seem plodding and stale and its writer not only shortsighted but incompetent. His later clumsy and ludicrous attempts to cover his tracks by revising the novel to include such historical events as Watergate only further undermine its plausibility.<br /><br />As a work of social and political commentary (which is how most of its fans seem to see it) it is only slightly more successful. Maybe in 1963&mdash;when John Kennedy was still alive and America's future looked about as bright as it ever has&mdash;this novel's bleak  vision was extraordinary and its preachy cynicism relevant; but now it just seems bleak and preachy ... and old.<br /><br />Successful science fiction always seems fresh, like a unique and imaginative vision of the future; even if its predictions of the future prove off-target, its vibrant imagination keeps it emotionally if not historically relevant and rewarding. This book just seems stale, like a Billy Graham sermon from the same period, warning of the doom about to befall us at any moment. It's boring and naive, not relevant.<br /><br />Most of the characters are acceptably believable, though, which is why I give it two stars instead of one. Betty Jo and Bryce seem like real people, and even the alien Newton is believable enough as a person until we're expected to start feeling sorry for him. The notion of an alien invader who fails because he can't lay off the gin may be irritating, but it IS original. And I do feel sorry for him, to some extent, NOT because he won't stop drinking but because the task he was given of saving his dying world is just too much for any one person to bear. His using alcohol as an excuse to forsake his mission is just that: an excuse (as it is for all alcoholics), not the real cause. The real cause is that he had accepted a mission that was impossible for him to fulfill.<br /><br />So this book is a huge disappointment, but it may be worth reading for its characters, who are believable enough to make reading it fairly interesting. Great literature it definitely is not. It's not even great science fiction."
1912,5,"I now have all the Jack Reacher's in paperback. They are fabulous books, sad that the movie doesn't live up to the books. Can't have a 5 ft. 6 in. man try to play a 6ft.5in. man, just won't work."
1913,5,I can't look at time the same after reading this treasure of a book. Paraphrasing my favorite quote: Why does God limit our time? To teach us the precious value of each day.
1914,5,Excellent reference book. Well researched and complete. I'm a long time shooter but learned some things of which I was not aware. Will recommend to others.
1915,5,A beautiful book and a great addition to any Beatles or George Harrison library.  Mostly unseen photos and stories from the family make it even more special.
1916,5,"Like millions of Baby Boomers, I grew up on peanut butter. How many hundreds of Skippy (extra chunk style) peanut butter sandwiches did my mom send to school with me? I dunno, but such sandwiches still spell c-o-m-f-o-r-t to me 50 years later, although I've switched to Trader Joe's organic crunchy in the interim. Jon Krampner tells, with engaging good humor and impressively researched detail, the fascinating story of this truly all-American foodstuff. Who knew, for example, why mainstream PB became so sweet and smooth? Or how Skippy fell from its pedestal as the top seller? Or the complicated processes involved in growing, harvesting, and roasting those humble peanuts? I loved this book and didn't want it to end. Like a perfectly executed PBJ, Krampner's offering is by turns reassuring, nourishing, and delicious."
1917,4,"I thought this was a cute little story about writer's block, the revision process, and how a sweet puppy eventually befriends an owl.<br /><br />This book might be a little lengthy for the preschool set, but could be just right for those kindergartners or even 1st graders who are starting to unravel the mystery of putting words together in a written story for the first time.<br /><br />A nice follow-up to [[ASIN:0375858997 How Rocket Learned to Read]]."
1918,5,"I bought this book, it was amazing ! it contains the most needed tools to practice copy-writing. using samples and colorful pages makes reading the book fun!"
1919,5,Every chapter touches on points that make sense to me as recommended to me to help sort out issues that have stemmed from my childhood.  I recommend this as self help study to everyone. Thank You!
1920,5,"I bought this book because I saw a friend of mine lose 70 pounds and go from being sick to being healthy.  If followed, amazing results can happen."
1921,5,This was purchesed as a Christmas gift for a 9 year old boy that has reading difficulty.  He loved it.
1922,5,My daughter's teacher recommeded this practice guide. This is an excellent study tool. Using this practice guide helped raise my daughters math scores considerably. It really reinforces what shes learning in the classroom. I recommend this guide to all parents even if their child is doing great in math.
1923,5,"Awesome study guide really helps, color makes it more intersting. just needs to get update because the HESI test doesn't require chemistry or physics."
1924,4,"The book I received had the Latin text on the left side pages and a translation in English on the right. The translation is basically one from the 1500's which has been somewhat modernized. I have seen that some of the sexy bits of the book have been toned down or omitted entirely, and this may bother some readers who like a COMPLETE work w/out censorship. Other than this slight issue I was very pleased, and the anachronistic language in the English translation was not a problem at all."
1925,5,"This is a delightful story that is well told and easily read. The illistrations are lovely and enhance the tale of this tail well wgged by Kelly.  Kuddos to my siter-in-law, the author for a job well done!"
1926,5,I LOVE all the Ted Bell books about Alex Hawke.  I had already read some of his later ones and then went back to start at the beginning.  Just awesome books.  AND Alex Hawke IS better than Bond!
1927,5,"quick and painless<br />gr8 deal too, it is nice when u get a good deal and good service also thanx"
1928,5,"I bought this as part of a gift basket, and it was just what I had in mind.  It arrived when promised."
1929,4,I ENJOYED READING THIS AND SO DID MOST OF THE GALS IN THE CLUB. 6 MORE WORDS ARE RE QUIRED
1930,3,"The Twilight series seemed to me like it was just another boring sci-fi love story...however I decided to give it a read and see what all the buzz was about. It took a while for me to get into it, but once I did I was finished the whole series in no time."
1931,4,Nice book... I'm still not sure if it has the reciepe that I am looking for - an Italian butter cookie.
1932,5,Used this book as a mom's church group study. We loved the practical advice and all the wonderful ideas that it gave us
1933,3,"I've been sewing for nearly 50 years, and I've rarely been stumped on following instructions. I can usually figure them out w/o much trouble. But this book threw me for a loop!<br /><br />I really love the pretty projects in this book. But I wish the author had spent less time on general serger instructions (threading, etc.) and more time clearly illustrating the projects which required turning things inside out, like the eyeglasses case. This book would be much better with more illustrations and/or an companion DVD.<br /><br />It would have helped to use highly contrasting fabrics for better clarity. I realize that the finished product needed to look nice for the sample, but that could have been accomplished by using plain/print fabrics.<br /><br />Also, it was frustrating to think that these projects could be finished in minutes. I spent over 30 minutes trying to make something that looked like it should go together in 10 minutes. (Eyeglasses case)<br /><br />I know that when I (eventually!) work out how to get things to come out right, I'll have a blast making these pretty gifts."
1934,5,"I have never been a morning person! I'm sure you can relate in some way. Getting up at all let alone early was a struggle every single morning. Notice I said was! Hal's book has not only changed the way I start and end my days, it has changed thousands of others as well! And he's just getting started!! The Miracle Morning is a must read only and I mean ONLY if you want a change in your life. Do you want to become the best person that deep down you know you can be? Do you dream of waking every morning full of energy, spirit, and motivation? Could you just use a pick-me-up in your life? READ THIS BOOK!!"
1935,4,"That's really what &#34;Bite&#34; is. The whole vampire thing is only a narrative stepping stone to the romance between the two protagonists. Odd choice for a stepping stone, but this IS Richard Laymon.  Maybe it's because I already knew about the early plot shift, but to me the book doesn't start getting good until that shift comes. At the outset Sam gets a visit from his long-lost love Cat, who has a bizarre request. So, naturally, he agrees to help her kill an alleged vampire. These first several chapters are rather dull, because they present too much too soon and the hasty buildup to the vampire deters investment. Also, since Sam's feelings for Cat are more told than shown at this point, his actions come off as kinda stupid. But there is an apparent homage to &#34;Blue Velvet&#34;, so take that however you will.  Things pick up when the story moves on to its next phase, wherein the threat to Sam and Cat is more grounded and thus relatable. Not that I've ever gone through such an experience myself, but this new antagonist probably reflects much more of the real world than a vampire does. Which might disappoint readers who were expecting full-blown supernatural horror, but just pulled me in deeper. It also helps that some legitimate heat develops between our heroes. This doesn't necessarily make their actions any smarter—almost by definition, it makes their actions dumber—but it ratchets up the entertainment instead of hindering it. And so does Laymon's shameless use of Murphy's Law to stretch the story to its outlandish limits.  Even considering its author, &#34;Bite&#34; is an unconventional book, and going into it blind may not be a good idea. It begins as a subpar vampire tale and evolves into a romantic road thriller. The latter somehow ends up more ridiculous and audacious than the former, but hell, I believed it. What's more, I actually cared about the romance, which became the main thing that kept me reading. I'm sad like that.  8/10ke that.  8/10"
1936,3,I am very aware of Pat and her books but this one is obviously tyring to befor the US and therefore does not provide all the info I need.
1937,4,"Curchill's literary style makes the opening chapters a challenge.  A prior interest, and some knowledge of this era in history is a great help to the reader, while the author developes his material.<br />  A cohesive, well-written, story of the time is the result.  Make your way through the early pages of the book, it's worth it!"
1938,4,"The Hawk's Mountain series is one of my favorites! I read this one as soon as it came out and can't wait for the next one, Winter Magic. It's a great story about the lives of people who live on Hawk's Mountain."
1939,5,"Strip away all the myths, legends, and character enhancements, and you have an honest account of who the human beings were, that helped found the greatest nation on earth. Their qualities of sacrifice, and integrity in looking to establish something much bigger than themselves is amazing. All the warts, pimples, and egos are here to see, but then so is their love of America. I enjoyed this book immensely. It filled in a lot of the historical questions that I had. Easy to read and comprehend."
1940,5,My husband and I heard about this book from a friend. We order it read it love it and pass it on for others to read
1941,4,"Chew 's book is a very detailed histroy of the WInter War between Finland and Russia.  Though not as easy to read as other books on this subject, it provides a good understanding of the circumstances leading up to the outbreak of hostilites and the forces both political and miltary engaged in the conflict.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading it."
1942,5,"There seem to be a lot of misconceptions floating around in the negative reviews, many involving semantics.<br /><br />A straightforward distillation of Sam Harris' thesis might be:<br /><br />\\""You're free to choose what you want... but you're not free to choose what you WANT to want.\\""<br /><br />If that thought starts your mind turning then this is a book for you."
1943,5,I am from Colorado and my family is from New Mexico. I come from a long line of santeros. This book is good reading about a man that I have admired his work for years. The book was in great condition and I would definitely buy from them again.
1944,5,"The book was written for people who work in the educational field, but it is an amazingly helpful resource for anyone with an interest in educational law.  I imagine that even lawyers who are new to the field would find it very helpful."
1945,5,"This book is awesome for teaching kids how to cook, and keeping their attention while doing so.<br />This book is definitely meant for parent/child interaction in the kitchen, not intended for unsupervised kids to use.<br />Overall, a really fun, colourful, whimsical approach to cooking for kids. Love it!"
1946,5,"The book is well organized into chapters with descriptive names, so you could first read the titles that most appeal to you. There is a chapter on Reiki.  The whole book is great, but, you can pick and choose the subjects you are most curious about. Putting into practice the suggestions in the book will help you purify you body and mind."
1947,3,It wasn't anything like Knight In Shining Armor.. And it wasn't so good I just couldn't put it down. It was just ok. I feel like my time could have been better spent on some other great read.
1948,5,Great reference for anyone using university calculus<br />Anyone taking calculus should have a student solutions manual for help on problems
1949,2,"A jet airliner landing on the interstate, then taxiing across the median to take off in the opposite direction; a pathologist placed in charge of the crash investigation by the NTSB, airports capable of handling large jet liners popping up in places where no such facility exists, etc., etc., etc.<br />The book is readable, I'll say that. Mr. Dana Haynes can write well, but needs a fact checker and an editor in a bad way. It's like he rushed through this book in order to meet some kind of deadline and sacrificed accuracy and quality as a result.<br />Try again, Mr. Haynes. Maybe the next one will fly. This one doesn't"

She helps writers of all genres create their \\""platform statements\\"" and shows them how to broadcast (even in photo file names!) to attract agents, publishers, the media, and fans.

1951,4,"I enjoyed this book, and couldn't put it down. The only complaint I have is how abruptly it ended, after being so invested in the story and the characters I would have liked to have seen a few pages with what happened after the final confrontation. Other than that if you are looking for a quick read, that is somewhat suspenseful  (although you figure out who the murderer is in the first 1/3 of the book)I would pick this one up. It's free on Kindle right now, and one of the better free reads on here."
1952,5,Being a decendent of one of the families from this book I was really excited about reading it. It was a page turner for me becuase their are things about my ancestors that I did not know. This book opened my eyes to LDS history and its deep routes well before the move to utah even began.
1953,5,"I just finished this book on Pop Art (Phaidon Press) and I would like to congratulate the author for such beautiful and wonderful work! I found that the book was very objective, matter-of fact, well-documented, fun to read, informative, and the most important part: it has a very solid thesis at the start, which is demonstrated over and over throughout the book. I just love the very comprehensive nature of the work, the author's discussions on economics, politics, philosophy, anthropology, gender issues, and the readings he makes on some paintings. From a structural point of view, I like the way the author organized the subject matters, and the short bios he creates of the artists, before discussing their works. The interviews with some artists are a precious asset, as well as his knowledge on the techniques used by the artist. The multidisciplinary approach that he took (combining art, media/communications, etc.) is quite impressive and appositive to this type of work. So, I can only speak very highly of this work and of Phaidon (I have all the books on this series!!!)."
1954,5,"The title for my review would describe with brevity on what I experienced. This is an exhilarating read. It talks to about the real India, the India of the corrupt, the poor, the downtrodden. The grandma character is an instant classic. Through Balram Halwai, the author has exposed the real undercurrent of this nation which tends to believe itself to be a superpower. What country would be a superpower, unless it can provide a good standard of living for all it's people. Unfortunately India will remain so, for bribery runs in it's veins. Worth your time and money. Though I would suggest the used versions."
1955,5,"What happens to those who are in a comatose state?  Tony Spencer, a man full of anger and paranoia, discovers that life is more than the world as he once saw it when he succumbs to a brain tumor-induced coma.<br /> Tony finds himself in a strange place where he meets an interesting array of people, including C.S. Lewis, Jesus, and a mysterious Lakota woman, who lead him through the netherworld between earth and heaven in order to help him understand and overcome his pain and anger.<br /> Wm. Paul Young weaves a tale full of metaphors and allegory to show that a man, bitter because his son died at a young age, can still have a chance to encounter inner healing and demolish the walls of an inner prison that he had created out of his pain and suffering.  The protagonist, Tony, is shown several important lessons about his own life as Jesus, C.S. (Jack) Lewis, and the grandmotherly Lakota woman, who is a personification of the Holy Spirit, walk and talk with him as well as allow him to see the world through the eyes of other people, including a teen boy with Down's Syndrome, the boy's nurse, and a few others that he encounters.  Tony not only sees through the eyes of others, but he feels their emotions and interprets experiences through their perspectives.  In the midst of Young's narrative, Tony discovers that he has allowed his ego to take control of his soul and build walls inside his heart to block out the love of his ex-wife and daughter.  When he realizes what he has done, he begins to make peace with himself, which causes the walls to crumble in order to open the door to a new life.<br /> Although the concept of one God manifested in three separate and distinct persons is a mystery too complex for finite minds to grasp, Young's explanation by the character of Grandmother (the Lakota woman) is one that seems to make sense for people to understand it in human terms.  I like how Grandmother explains to Tony that a person is \\""a spirit interpenetrating a soul interpenetrating a body.  But it is not simply interpenetration.  It is dance and participation.\\""  Furthermore, she tells Tony, \\""...you `are' your body, and you `are' your soul, and you `are' your spirit.  You are an interpenetrated and interpenetrating whole, a unity of diversity but essentially a oneness.\\""<br /> Initially, I had difficulty reading Cross Roads.  It seemed to start slow, but I may have been projecting a false lack of interest due to the nature of the protagonist being in a coma and in the process of dying, which is a reminder of the recent loss of a loved one.  However, by the time I read about a third of the way through the book, I found myself not wanting to put it down.  I recommend Wm. Paul Young's Cross Roads for those who have doubted past decisions or who have dealt with bitterness and pain, loss and misery.  Not only does Young have a good story but also a strong message involving love's restoration and forgiveness.trating a body.  But it is not simply interpenetration.

1956,5,"This is a rare kind of book found in current mathematical writing - a book that motivates, seeks connections across disciplines, and attempts to paint the broader picture of how the individual concepts and results are the pieces of a much larger puzzle. It is obvious that the author is on a mission, namely to convince the reader that contemporary mathematical foundations are important, applicable and useful to formulate, investigate and answer questions in mathematics and computer science. The book does so by drawing on many examples picked from widely across those disciplines, not only in the main text but even more so in the exercises.<br /><br />Particularly in the light of more critical reviews of this text, though, I must admit that this is not the first book I have been reading on the material covered here. But it is surely one of the more enjoyable and insightful expositions in this field."
1957,4,"Sarah and her family move east to Pennsylvania for the summer in order to fix up her grandmother's house in order to sell it. Her mom isn't too thrilled about this prospect - there are a lot of painful memories tied up in such a move. While her mom's past is never fully explored, the few stories told about Sarah's grandmother make it questionable as to wither or not the lady was mentally there enough to raise a kid on her own. Matters become more strained when the family is kept up at night by mysterious knockings they can't explain and the unexpected discovery of a locked door in the basement - one Sarah's mom says she once heard led to a land where all the souls of the dead sleep for eternity. But for Sarah the summer proves to be looking up once she discovers the secret doorway behind the bookshelf in her room.<br /><br />Behind the door lays Scotopia, a land of eternal night, rivers of moonlight, fantastical monsters, and even Balthazat, the King of Cats himself. But things are not what they seem, and soon Sarah and her little brother Billy find that there is much more to the king than they previously thought, and that there is more than one door in their house that leads to a mysterious place ...<br /><br />I really enjoyed getting my hands on my copy of this ARC. It's a fun, spooky, and wildly imaginative story for younger readers (as well as older kids and adults who have not lost their sense of fun and wonder) who might be bored with the usual thoroughfare for grade schoolers who want something darker to read. While Steensland is very careful to keep things age appropriate, Sarah and her brother, quite literally, go to hell and back, make a deal with the devil, gaze upon the face of god, converse with the dead and play hooky with monsters. And yet all of it is handled in a completely charming manner, that is so easily accessible to kids, and so believable, that it's very hard not to find yourself caught up in their adventures.<br /><br />My only complaint is that things wrapped up too soon for my liking and I was left with more questions than answers at the end of this since it's obviously setting its self up for a sequel. Oh well, can't have 'em all. When October rolls around I'm going to be first in line to pick up a real copy at the store and know that I'll have just as much fun following Sarah around for a second time while I wait for more.that things wrapped up too soon for my liking and I was left with more questions than answers at the end of this since it's obviously setting its self up for a sequel.

1958,5,"I've been lucky enough to get to meet Leon and his lovely wife on several occasions and heard the magic he can still bring with his voice.  After reading this book, I can't wait to see him again as this book shows the persistence and hard work he put in to reach the point where he did as vocalist for Bob Wills and The Texas Playboys.  I also want to congratulate him for being lucky enough to get and to hold his lovely wife for all these years and all she did to support him and help him on his trail.  This book make me really understand his trail to where he reached and his ability to keep his eye on the goal !  This book proves that nice guys can finish first !!"
1959,5,"I purchased this book off recommendation from my pastor. This book is a very good way of doing devotions with my children (ages 3 and 6). The best thing I like about the book is you read the passage(s) from the Bible and then the author does a great job providing questions, discussion ideas and then towards the end of the week, ties in Jesus and how the scriptures point to Jesus. Great book and I highly recommend it."
1960,5,This book is well written and insightful and a good example of all Joan Chittister's writing.  I often give it as a gift to friends.  I highly recommend it.
1961,5,"As a kid in the early 60's I devoured all the Kjelgaard books I could get.  I must have read over 20.  They were all vivid in their mental pictures of the natural world and the special men, boys soon to be men, and animals that lived within his pages.  Always the theme was growth through love and intellect, whether it be a rough out doors man, a husky, or a silken haired Irish setter."
1962,5,"This planner had the cutest art and just the right amount of space to write down special events, not too big or bulky to carry."
1963,5,"I have seen other people use Elliot waves and make money from it, so I was interested in finding out more. The information is presented in an easy to understand format, with plenty of examples and diagrams. If you are a swing trader or want to understand more about the psychology of the market and its effects, this is a great book to read."
1964,5,"I chanced upon the 4th book of this series almost 6 years ago, and after such I long time, I finally found it on Amazon! One of the best fantasy novels available, which can even compete with Tolkein's Lord of the Rings to an extent. Amazing read: A must for all fantasy lovers!"
1965,5,"I am a mid-thirties MFA student creating a short film based on the life at the palace of Knossos.  I own many books on and related to the topic and have been researching for a few years now.  This book arrived yesterday and I am already a third of the way through it.  Very well written, organized quite well.  A nice amount of illustrations showing the design and layout of various ancient sites.  This helps a visual person like myself fully understand the descriptions.<br />If you are interested in ancient life in the Aegean world I would recommend this book."
1966,4,"A wonderfully, inspiring book. Jane Goodall communicates her fears and vision for the future in a sensitive, passionate and lively way. Although a documentary, the book reads like a good novel."
1967,4,"The previous reviews were posted prior to the copyrighted release of the 2nd edition of the book (2011). For example, the question posted by drew is corrected in the book I have. I believe the book even has a different publisher than the first."
1968,3,"I was looking forward to reading Secrets, and it ended up telling a really interesting story!    Secrets is the first book in the Hero Chronicles Series. It follows a boy, Nicholas, who had been living in hiding for multiple years, after becoming a hero. When he moves into a new town, he starts to gain newfound fame from football and meets the perfect girl. However, he may end up having to choose between them or keeping his secret.    The plot was super interesting for this book, and I was eager to find out what Nick had done in the book to make him into a hero. His aunt was so paranoid about people finding him, so I figured it must have been something big. It took about 3/4 of the book until the secret was finally revealed and from there, I loved how action-packed the plot became. Also, there were several mysterious things that happened to Nick throughout the book that kept me reading.    Nick has a love interest, Elle. I liked her, but I felt she was somewhat too perfect. I wish she had been described some more, especially her backstory- which was mentioned once to twice in Secrets. I did think Elle and Nick had an extremely cute relationship, though. Also, I usually don't like reading about male main characters, but I really enjoyed Nick's perspective.    Unfortunately, I felt the dialogue and narration fell flat. I didn't think the way some of the teenagers talked was realistic and I felt certain details were put in that weren't necessary. Certain lines didn't have anything to do with the story, and stated basic facts.    Overall, I enjoyed both the plot and Nick's perspective in Secrets. Although the dialogue wasn't the best, Secrets was still a good read. I'd give it 3 out of 5 flowers. If you're looking for a book with a great mystery in it, I'd check Secrets out! :)    *Thanks to Kenwood Publishing Group for sending me a copy of Secrets to read and review! :)    Review also posted at [...]"
1969,5,"Usually in a collection of short stories there are some that should be left out. Not true with this book. I loved every story. My favorites were, \\""Reflections on an Extraordinary Crime Stopper.\\"" They were funny and had a twist at the ending.<br /><br />Gread reads."
1970,5,"Joonie is a character you will want to root for from the beginning pages. Through his journey filled with artful imagery and touching illustrations, Joonie proves that being awakened is always worthwhile. He shows us that our own potential can be just as daunting as any monsters outside of us but if we summon our courage and use it we have the possibility of reaching that potential. We may even find out we are not alone in the process. A beautiful tribute to Colorado and the nature it has provided for so long - Joonie and the Great Harbinger Stampede by Daniel Landes is a definite read for anyone with the sense to ponder."
1971,5,"Just buy this book, it will change your life. Josh's story and way of explaining the Bible will make you really think. If your not into thinking, get the book anyway it's an easy read :). I reminded myself several times how blessed I am to know Josh because I kept thinking how bad I want to have coffee with him and hear more of his stories!"
1972,4,"Lovely story thru letters. I have always loved to read books that were composed of letters, partly or wholely. I do appreciate the author telling the rest of the story at the end. This story is heartwarming and heartbreaking. I do recommend it to everyone.<br /><br />This caveat...it would have been 5 stars and I would have been in tears if I had not had to hold a magnifying glass to read the very small print. The fact that I WOULD hold the magnifying glass attests to the power of the story."
1973,5,"Tom Friedman's \\""flat\\"" world is hyperconnected and, thanks to the internet, increasingly transparent (think Wikileaks). In HOW, Dov Seidman paints us a powerful picture of why this means we need to redefine business as usual. In a world in which your innovations can quickly be copied by global competitors at half the price, and where information about your core business flies around the world at the speed of light, it is essential that you and your company focus on the way you do business--the HOW: your culture and behavior. If you are an inspirational leader, focusing on trust and building relationships, then your competition can't touch you.<br /><br />These days, a stable company cannot focuses on long-term success without having high quality and good service; in a hyperconnected, hypercompetitive world, these are no longer optional. Those that will *ultimately* succeed, says Seidman, build their business around core values. If this is done right--and in HOW, Seidman guides us gently toward an understanding of how to get to that point--it will help employees make better decisions, ultimately reducing a company's risk, increasing innovation, and supporting a strong workforce.<br /><br />Key to this is trust and transparency: building a \\""self-governing\\"" internal culture that trusts employees to make the right decision, and doing so in a way that encourages truth and transparency within the company. Trust is currency within the marketplace, and as much as the market will reward a trustworthy company, it will destroy an untrustworthy one--and companies can't hide their bad behavior anymore. As Seidman puts it, \\""Whether it be recruiting the best talent, negotiating with a potential customer, or defending a workers' compensation claim, more than ever companies have to answer for their culture, both in the courts and in the court of public opinion.\\""<br /><br />I would say that the moral philosophy that is a foundation to this book is simple enough to grasp at its core; understanding how this philosophy can be realized in a practical way is challenging and complex. Thanks to many good examples and a clearly defined structure, Seidman has crafted a very strong argument and a readable framework that will help the business world to achieve that end. I found it to be a fairly quick read, digestible in clearly defined chunks. Personally, I felt the last section on leadership to be a bit detached from the rest of the book, unusually prescriptive after 200 pages that read more subtly."
1974,3,"This book was good enough to keep me reading, but it's not one where the characters will stick out in my mind, other than probably Max West. He's the quintessential troubled artist, and despite his level of fame, he seemed surprisingly human. Other than Max, many of the characters appeared like they were wrapped in nice packages and tied with bows, but none of them ever tried to break out of the box, fight the herd, and certainly none of them bothered to scream \\""Look at me. I'm different.\\""<br /><br />Not to say that the writing isn't done effectively, because it is. Something appeared slightly off throughout most of the novel, though, like I was peering through a distorted lens, or a pair of sunglasses that had been dropped on the asphalt, and I couldn't seem to turn either of them just enough to have them properly come into focus. What that something was revolved around words and phrases that just seemed, like the lens, or the sunglasses, distorted, both in the dialogue and with the characters' inner monologues.<br /><br />The setting was done well. The author knows Nantucket with the same conviction that a mother would know her first child, and conveyed the scenes flawlessly and with what appeared to be little effort on her part. Even though I've never been to Nantucket, I felt like I was walking the streets holding Claire's hand.<br /><br />A SUMMER AFFAIR carries the same light breeze, as if the novel had swept in from the middle of the ocean, yet I had hoped for something just a bit more. This, however, is my fault, not the author's. Like other reviewers, this novel did end a bit too abruptly for my taste. If you prefer your novels to capture the sand at your feet, holding a drink in one hand and a book in the other, you may find yourself enjoying this one.<br /><br />Robert Downs<br />Author of Falling Immortality: Casey Holden, Private Investigator"
1975,5,"Wolf Hunting and the whole series of 6 books was one of my very favorite fantasy books of all time. The author is an excellent writer and has a great imagination. If you love wolves and other animals, magic, intrigue, and adventure, you can't help but love this series."
1976,5,"this book contains a lot of very good, basic gunsmithing information for a starter.<br /> its not meant to make you a 100% performance gun smith but a lot of good info.<br />great value.."
1977,3,"This is a light chic lit novel with a likable main character and interesting story line. What is a Southern gal to do when her husband wants to move to Vermont to run an inn? Somehow I doubt a true Southern gal would sell her house leave her friends and her country club on her husband's whim...but this is an easy light novel to read for fun, you may even crave Peaches when you finish the novel."
1978,5,"Irv's Odyssey: Lost in a Looking Glass (Book One)<br /><br />Set in the early 70's this is the story of a young man Irving Podolsky, recently graduated from UCLA. He sets out to find a directors job. He finds it is not easy, having no experience, and gets one rejection after another. The only job he can seem to get is in pornography, which he reluctantly takes.<br /><br />Soon he realizes he is going now where in the business (no one reputable will hire the porn director) he decides to pack his bags and move on. Once again he find landing a job is not easy. He finds himself working at a mental hospital in a lowly position. But he needs to pay the rent and eat. So he takes the only job he can find, tending to the mentally challenged.<br /><br />Filled with sex, drugs & rock-n-roll of the 70's this is a humorous journey through one mans early years fresh out of college. I look forward to the next[[ASIN:1936780445 Irv's Odyssey: To the Light and Beyond (Book Two)]]."
1979,4,"The book started off a little slow for me.  It is VERY detailed.  As I read further, I came to really appreciate this writer's style.  The story is unique and interesting.  The best parts are in the final 50 pages."
1980,5,"Any trip downtown benefits some planning.  If you miss where you're going, it can take 5 minutes a turn to make the 3 turns (15 min)to go back around the block.<br /><br />This map was great because it had the names of buildings, showed pedways? (elevated or underground people paths between buildings, parking and more.<br /><br />Can't remember if this one also showed a 3D perspective view of the loop on the back side.<br /><br />Would be nice if they brought it back.  I prefer the American maps over the most the Rand McNally maps, although RM never had one like this.  This was the only choice.  Not the same as just a regular loop map."
1981,3,"I just received this book and find it entirely identical, apart from the cloth cover, to the paperback edition of 2000. It is a great collection of Snyder's poetry and prose, but it should be called a re-issue rather than a 2012 edition."
1982,5,"Wonderful book, it is a Christmas gift, but I had to take a peek.  I can't wait to share recipes with friends from this book, I love The Chew, and shopping at Amazon."
1983,5,This calendar shows how beautiful & athletic these dogs are. Get it if you love athletic dogs in small packages.
1984,4,"Good thing for anyone who does rpgs that need something to use either for combat, or as a map or something. I've been pretty happy with mine, the only complaint I could have is that it's quite folded up from travel, and it really needs to be held down by blocks for each corner in order to get the best use out of it that you can. But, it's exactly what's described, and I'm happy."
1985,5,"An excellent production of the masterpiece work by Handel! I listen to it throughout the year - not just during the holidays.  I especially like the choral selections!  Though the \\""lyrics\\"" are simply Scripture, the words and music together are awe-inspiring!"
1986,5,"I took up watercolor recently and ordered watercolor books from Amazon to read up on the subject, they had such good prices I ended up buying several.  The books have great pictures, instructions & tips in them that are very helpful."
1987,5,"his may not be MY mother's make ahead and freeze cookbook, but since I am buying a copy for my daughter (to keep her from stealing mine), the title isn't exactly true. :-)<br /><br />I have other cookbooks that are make ahead, and I am very impressed with this particular one. It is chock full of wonderful recipes and practical suggestions, that will help you to control the ingredients you use, and that will help you eat more healthily (if that is your goal) and more cheaply.<br /><br />In my first glance, I immediately picked up on the total ease of the make your own packages of oatmeal - where you can even include powdered milk, and the small individual sundae cups I can make ahead for my granddaughter.<br /><br />To open, it has a series of cooking plans, including vegetarian, and then it follows with creating your own cooking plan. These plans give a complete,recipe list for everything you will be cooking, then designate the order to cook things. They also include tips and tricks, like putting your chicken in the crock pot the night before, so it will be ready the day you do your mass cooking.<br /><br />Following these are the actual recipes, so you can make a single meal if you choose, rather than cooking 10-25 meals in a single day. By doubling any recipe, you have one for now and one to freeze for later, for those of us who don't have the time or budget to cook scads at once. The cooking plans do a good job of making various recipes, so you don't get stuck with too many identical meals."
1988,5,"\\""Hell Beneath Atlantis\\"" is just \\""one\\"" of many reprints of Marvel Classics from the '70s. This volume is literally \\""bloated\\"" with great \\""old stuff\\"" that occupied space in our \\""dresser drawer\\"" or beneath out \\""bunk\\"" beds. Look again, the PRAISE you had then (for this masterpiece) was deserved. Mike Ploog (Illustrator) went on to \\""storyboard\\"" a backload of popular motion pictures.

1989,5,I am thrilled to finally have this cookbook in my hands! Jenny's recipes are simple to prepare and perfect for all ages. They are suitable for kitchen pros and newbies.

Thanks Jenny for inspiring us to cook for ourselves and our families :) ~ marla
1990,3,"I have read several books on the desert Fathers and I ordered this one because I like Merton.  I wanted to see which sayings he would highlight.  I have ALWAYS found reading through the desert ascetic tradition, forgive the pun, rather dry.  You have to read through to get some gems.  I have to say that those gems are always there.  Another issue I think is that for the modern reader, it is difficult to connect with this tradition because of the writing and their approach.  They defined their faith through simplicity, poverty, humility and self-control. The tradition is venerated in Christianity but it is a couple of steps removed from the mainstream...understandably so.  Merton's choices in selecting certain sayings didn't shed any light for me on his spirituality.  Maybe I am simply not reading it as closely as I need to, but I don't see a discernible pattern apart from his own monasticism.  Another book that might be of use is Yushi Nomura's work, \\""Desert Wisdom\\"".  It still is the Desert Wisdom tradition though so you have to work a bit to enter into this way of being.  Both of these are worthwhile if you are willing to put in some time and contemplation.[[ASIN:1570753717 Desert Wisdom: Sayings from the Desert Fathers]]"
1991,5,"This is a pastiche of stories, memories and  poems about widowhood and survival.  The authors face their grief  with courage and pathos.  They emerge as strong and willful individuals.  It is a positive account of how we survive suffering. I recommend this book not only to widows and widowers but to everyone who wants to find meaning and strength in life."
1992,5,"Wolf Revenge opens with the chosen one, Ashton Chayton, ready to embark on his hunt for those who destroyed his family, his race and his planet - his world. Throughout the first book, Wolf Dawn, Ash grew into the first stages of manhood while being pursued by agents of the United Worlds government. He was a boy with a price on his head but one with much more than ordinary natural gifts and abilities.<br /> The author has created a very real and likeable character in Ash. With his newly discovered abilities, and without knowing their true extent, Ash rushes off to seek his revenge. Is his specific target truly responsible for Ash's problems? Ash, based entirely on his prejudice against the man and the reports issued by the United Worlds government, thinks so. Impetuous enough to take on the whole empire but still inclined to listen to the advice of his more mature friends, it is to his credit that he constantly strives to do the right thing. After he is forcefully hit in the head and then has everything laid out for him, like most seventeen year olds, he comes to understand the real situation.<br /> Susan Cartwright's ability to create characters that are entirely believable does not end with Ash. All of the major characters, whether they be Ash's true love - the Temple Prefect Lindah, or the villainous Neopol are at least as real as those on the six o'clock news.<br /> The reader, or at least this reader, assumes from the beginning that the villain will get what's coming to him in the end, but the characters with their differing values, motives and senses of justice, along with the captivating story line, keep the reader guessing as to who will do the dirty deed and when they will do it. During the course of the book I changed my mind about how it would end at least a dozen times but ended up being dead wrong anyway. The suspense was maintained till the very last minute.<br /> Due to some scenes that are fairly graphic I would not recommend this book to young readers but I definitely would to any adult who enjoys a good, fairly fast paced story,  story. I look forward to the next in the series and to anything else Susan Cartwright writes. With this book I think she has shown Wolf Dawn was not just a flash in the pan. She is the real thing and I am sure will be around for a long time."
1993,5,"This is great logic riddles for my elementary gifted students! They love it! Gave 4 instead of 5 stars bc it is short. But great for the price! Would buy again. If fact! I'm going to buy the \\""more stories\\"" continuation, which I believe exists!"
1994,5,"The remarkable life and legacy of \\""H.J.\\"" is so well articulated in this book. It is now a rare book, worthy of positive review. Having known him in the 1969's, I remember his humble spirit and outstanding leadership in his business and on several boards. This book presents his \\""Four Way Test\\"" first adopted as the corporate statement for Club Aluminum (when he became CEO), then adopted by Rotary International and several Chambers of Commerse. He and writer Robert Walker served on the board of Christian Service Brigade, one of six youth organizations \\""H.J.\\"" conceived.

1995,5,"I have read a lot of software design book and this is by far the clearest I have read.<br /><br />I write Ruby on Rails applications for a living and recently have been hitting the issues that large poorly designed Rails applications hit.  Find and watch Robert C. Martin's video keynote Architecture - The Lost Years, go read some of Avdi Grimm's Object On Rails book, search for Sandi's Less - The Path to Better Design.<br /><br />If you find yourself nodding as you watch and read any of these materials then come back and grab a copy of this book!  Sandi writes as clearly as she speaks.<br /><br />One of the things I used to think when developing a Rails application was that if I stuck with the \\""Rails Way\\"" I could always come back and change that decision.  I have been learning the hard way that this is not \\""The Way\\"" and that more often than not I end up with dependencies and couplings that make that later change either extremely difficult to near impossible.  I was one of those programmers that having tasted the Rails candy forgot all the good OOD techniques I used to use in Java.<br /><br />I have to thank people like Sandi for helping me to wake up :-)"
1996,5,"Some time ago I saw a small sign in a craft store that read: \\""I AM woman!  I AM tired!\\""  Well, that small sign got me to thinking...why are we women tired?  Stress?<br />So, when I had an opportunity to read Tracie's book, Stressed-Less LIVING Finding God's Peace in Your Chaotic World, I knew that Tracie \\""hit the nail on the head.\\""  In chapter eight, p. 157, Addicted to Adrenaline, was something I had, also, been thinking about.  Tracie talks about how people, mainly business people, \\""who run from task to task, thriving on their hurried pace, eating on the go, toting their laptop or iPad, and feeling as if any declaration of the speed of their lives would be seen as a negative personal attribute.\\""  She goes on to talk about how people become adrenaline junkies...a dangerous affliction.  How people actually are \\""doing themselves in.\\""  Aren't we, moms, a lot like these business people. Yes, we run from task to task and we become adrenaline junkies-creating our own stress.  And what does stressed spell backwards?  That's right!  Dessert!  We, women/moms, get tired and the first thing you know we head for the desserts thinking that our bodies will run faster and better with some sugar laden treat and, guess what?  Our bodies do get some fuel and we run for maybe an hour and boom! we are tired and feel stressed for lack of goodness!<br />I like the answer that Tracie presents...we need to delve into God's Word and take more time with our Heavenly Father.<br />This book was a great help and encouragement to my soul.  I loved the Stress Busting Scriptures at the end of the chapters and the Reflections Questions helped me to think about what I had read and how to incorporate them into my own daily schedule.<br />Yes, I can de-stress!  But it begins with me and how I incorporate God's Word into my day.<br />If you want to de-stress with God's help, then this is the book for you!<br />*This book was provided for review by Leafwood Publishers*"
1997,5,"The Amateur is well written and very easy to understand. It's so sad that all of what is in the book is true. There is no leader in the White House...no one knows what should be done...or how to get things done. It's funny in a sad way; however scarey. All Michell wants to do is spend money and take trips! The book says she takes a trip about every 9 days, taking as many as she can on the trips in Air force One on our (the taxpayer's dime).<br />The name of the book came from Bill Clinton; and when you read the book, you will find that Bill wants Hillery to run for President, because Bill wants back in the White House.<br />Everyone should read this book...we have a clown and liar for a President!<br />I bought the book at Amazon.com."
1998,4,"I had this book and it was lost in  a flood.  I was very excited to find another copy as it is now out of print.  The mother and guests went wild for items I made.  Several have asked me to keep them in mind when they need baby gifts.  I hope you all found this helpful and if you try to buy the book look under \\""31 baby shower thread gifts\\"".  You might have to try mixing the words.  Good Luck, I am sure you will enjoy."
1999,4,I purchased this book for my granddaughters for Christmas.  Although I haven't given it to them yet I think they will enjoy it because there are a couple of pages that are perfect for preschoolers - riding a trike and a big girl bike.
2000,5,"Lose Weight Without Diet or Working Out is the best book I have read in years. I started to read my book as sooon as it came in the mail, I found my self reading chapter after after, I was done in 2 days. WOW.  This book is packed with so much GREAT information what to eat to get healthy. Information regarding what foods to eat during the DETOX phase such as; fruits, veggies, beans, nuts was a lil scary at first but I did it along with adding the supplements that JJ mention and plenty of water. Lose Weight Without Diet or Working Out also told u how to get your skin looking healthy and how to reduce cellulite among other helpful ideas to get your sexy back. I started the DEM system in April and after the 21 days of detox i was down 17lbs. The Eat & Move phase was also helpful, telling you what foods to eat to continue loose weight and burn fat, also they were lots of ideas on how to keep moving doing simple things around the house and at the office or where ever you may be. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Lose Weight Without Diet or Exercise, again this is a must read.  Thank you JJ for a wonderful book!!"
2001,5,My daughter reads theses books and she loves them all. She is constantly asking me to buy her another one.
2002,5,"In a small town in the middle of Georgia, trouble is brewing for Cherry. When a family wants Cherry to sketch a picture of their dead son (in his coffin no less), Cherry doesn't realise she is heading into a mystery that could spell the end for her.<br /><br />I love finding cozy mysteries that are a little different to anything I've read so far. Of course this is hard to do since I have read quite a lot of cozies. However, I've never read one with a feisty sketch artist. That was before I picked up Portrait of a Dead Guy.<br /><br />Portrait of a Dead Guy was so enjoyable, that I challenge any reader not to fall in love with the vertically challenged, feisty sleuth, Cherry Tucker. Cherry has her hands full with a rival competing for business, an ex-flame and her family. Yet she manages this with all the southern charm, humor and finesse that is Cherry Tucker.<br /><br />The mystery definitely had me puzzled and contemplating motives even after I turned the last page. Just when I thought I knew the killer, the author added another suspect into the mix and I was stumped.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed Portrait of a Dead Guy and I absolutely can't wait to see what adventure is in store for Cherry Tucker next."
2003,5,"I agree with everything in the previous reviewers have said.  As an earth science teacher in Oregon, I have long been familiar with the broad strokes of the story of the Bretz Floods.  I led many field trips for middle school kids into the Columbia River Gorge and taught about the floods from that perspective.  Now retired, I bought the book and have made three trips through the region.  I have hiked in the sage brush to find hidden coulees.  I have driven from Portland to Missoula to trace the floods.  I have stood at the shore of what was glacial Lake Missoula, and I am a changed man as the result of what I have seen.  Read, and then go forth to visit this amazing landscape.  Don't forget to pack the book.  It will lead you mile by mile, step by step through some of the most overwhelming geology you will ever experience."

2005,3,"David Harris's Creation of the 'RESISTANCE' which played a key role in the late sixties to ralley Anti War sentiment against War in South East Asia, is reflected through a Kalidascope of impressions and symbolic critique of the source  of our overseas Imperialism during the Cold War long after he published 'Goliath.'<br /><br />His radical syntax patterned somewhat after Richard Farina's \\""Been Down so long it looks Like Up to me,\\"" and other counter culture ethos, may prove a disappointment if you want to learn of the inner workings of Movement Protest and Counter Culture Organization. But it provides a mirror that let's you inside the mind of one of the classic leaders of THE MOVEMENT.<br /><br />Entitled to his opinions, his self absorbion on the experience of leadership itself, may lead others to think this work in itself lends much insight into Harris motives or Method - but it surely provides a big clue on what it meant to a 'baby boomer' to be elevated to national prominance.

2007,1,"George seems like a kind and compassionate person with basically good intentions.  He has some genuine concerns, questions, and insights... yet I don't recommend buying this book.<br /><br />Conservative/fundamentalist Christians won't like this book because it won't be of any help to them in maintaining their carefully constructed Bible-worshiping illusions.  I guess I'm (what might be called) a liberal/progressive Christian, but I don't care for this book because it's badly written, poorly reasoned, and pretentious in tone.<br /><br />For the most part, George comes off as an ostentatious theological hipster spouting off pseudo-intellectual sludge.  If you like meandering, convoluted, self-indulgent, yet heartfelt conjectures regarding the Christian faith then this book might be just your thing.  I appreciate his emphasis on inclusion, his empathy with misfits, his disdain for rigid and institutionalized Christianity, etc... but I don't appreciate his lack of concern for critical thinking or his irresponsibility in treating theology as a plaything.<br /><br />I suspect George got a heady thrill from posing as a new and daring philosopher/theologian, but this immature attempt at profundity is mostly (though not completely) surface with very little substance.<br /><br />P.S.  The spelling and grammar in this book is atrocious.  Didn't anyone bother editing?"
2008,5,"I devoured The Disenchantments all in one afternoon.  I could not put this book down.  It was like watching a movie in my head.  Every time I had to get up to do something, or get something, all I could think about was rushing back to push play on that \\""movie\\"" that was running through my brain.  Each character was vivid and so real that I could see each thing they were doing playing out so completely.<br /><br />I am such a sucker for road trip books.  There is just something about throwing a bunch of people in a vehicle together for an extended period of time that makes the best and worst come out in them, and I just love that.  Nina LaCour did an amazing job with it.  I loved experiencing all the different places that the band visited, and meeting all the quirky and unique people they encountered along the way.<br /><br />Books with a male narrator can be really hit or miss with me, but I love them when they are done well, and Nina LaCour knocked this one out of the ball park with Colby.  I loved him in so many ways.  I adored that he wasn't your typical swoon-worthy perfect male lead.  He was funny, quirky, and the great guy best friend.  I absolutely love that in a guy main character.<br /><br />The Disenchantments was a fantastic coming of age story filled with heart-ache, loss, art, music, friendship, and ultimately - redemption.  This is the perfect book to pick up for a lazy day, or any day!  If you like contemporary go grab this one right now!  If you like music go grab it now!  If you like art go grab it now!  Just go grab it now!!! :)"

2011,5,"The DVD and book are fantastic and full of information that is essential for all of us stressed out women. Nicole has a way with words and is able to bring faith into the book in a way that is not pushy and she made me think about my life. Chapter 7 \\""The Comparison Game\\"" is an excellent chapter and discusses how we are constantly comparing ourselves to other people. She includes a assessment to find out where we fit in and how we can change our lives. According to the scores Nicole is able to provide us with insight and wisdom on how we can change the way we look at our selves and others.<br />All of the sessions on the DVD are short, easy to follow and just makes sense. The DVD discusses six major topics that include: Control, Insecurity, Comparisons, Fear, Anger and Unforgiveness. The DVD complements the book and I utilized the book when watching the DVD. I recommend that you obtain both the book and the DVD so you can get more information on the topic she is discussing."

You will learn tips and secrets that few others have ever discovered...or taken the time to share. Thanks for the awesome information!"
2018,5,"It wasn't until the late 1990s that I finally caught \\""Clerks\\"" on cable after hearing about it for years.  I remember being amazed at how it nailed my Gen-X angst at being an underachiever while wanting more out of life.  From that point on I followed Kevin Smith's work and have enjoyed most of his subsequent outings.  The man himself is also quite interesting, so I grabbed \\""An Askew View 2: The Films of Kevin Smith\\"", a revised and updated version of a previous book by John Kenneth Muir, for an entertaining in-depth view of Mr. Smith and his career.<br /><br />The first section (The Good Old Days: 1970-2002) begins with a brief biographical sketch of Kevin Smith's formative years, including his brief tenure as a film school student, and goes from 1994's \\""Clerks\\"" to the \\""Clerks Animated Series\\"" in 2000.  Part II (State of Red: 2003-2011) kicks off with 2004's \\""Jersey Girl\\"" and takes us through \\""Red State\\"" in 2011, concluding with some scoop on Kevin Smith's future plans (as of the book's writing) and the doings of some of his regular collaborators.  Each of Mr. Smith's projects receives an analysis by Mr. Muir that's filled out by cast and crew recollections, and there are three sections with photographs of the usual View Askew suspects in their natural habitat.<br /><br />Despite the author's somewhat fawning approach to all things Kevin Smith, I enjoyed Mr. Muir's take on the director and his body of work, although some of Mr. Smith's creations get deeper coverage than others (I was left wanting more in the \\""Clerks II\\"" chapter, for example).  He's obviously a huge fan of the View Askew universe, and from time to time he manages to escape his starry-eyed adoration long enough to admit that not everything Kevin Smith produces is criticism-proof.  But on the whole this is a fan's tribute to the object of his affection, and that isn't a bad thing.  Mr. Smith and his crew seem like a cool bunch of folks that deserve positive treatment, especially after being raked over the coals by some mean-spirited detractors.<br /><br />\\""An Askew View 2\\"" is great reading for admirers of Kevin Smith, especially those in the Generation-X category that his films so ably portray (and good-naturedly skewer).  Perhaps down the line there will be a third edition of this book that covers the further adventures of Kevin Smith in other media, such as television's \\""Comic Book Men\\"" and the online Smodcasts?

2027,3,"I think John Green is a great person. He's funny and so thoughtful. But I get so frustrated by his book reviews! Before TFIOS even came out, the review page was injected with 5 stars and squeals of delight in the comments. It's just so disingenuous and frankly disrespectful to the integrity of the reviewing process. Even now that the book has come out, there's an intense inflation of 5 star reviews. I am glad John Green is so loved. I am glad John Green is getting people to read and think thoughtfully about literature. Nevertheless, I can not contain my annoyance: this book is over-rated.<br /><br />I remember hearing John Green mention that one criticism he gets a lot is that he's derivative of himself, and he didn't really think that was much of an insult. I thought, good, because that's exactly how I feel. Supposing John Green would wade through the 109384204 reviews on this site I wouldn't want to offend the guy.<br /><br />Really, man: awkward teen boy with odd quirk (featured alongside wacky best friend) falls for interesting yet elusive or otherwise unavailable girl. I honestly don't remember anything about An Abundance of Katherines except the main character's name was Colin and he was a prodigy. The only thing that distinguishes any of his main characters is their \\""quirk\\"": quotes of dead people, etc.<br /><br />So needless to say, I was excited for the different-ness of the TFIOS premise. For that, it is my favorite of the John Green books. Still, as you can see from my rating, it was not perfect:<br /><br />1. Extremely flat characters. This was almost underlined in TFIOS, because in his previous books, the love interest was purposefully 2D, and of course many main characters feel flat. In TFIOS, the excuses ran out and it was just a series of characters distinguishable only in name.<br /><br />2. The over-injection of \\""like\\"" into teen dialogue. Sure, a lot of what the kids say is unrealistic, but that is furthered by the saturation of the word \\""like.\\"" NowI use like more than your average person, but this is borderline ridiculous. I understand maybe in the 90s or whenever John Green was a teenager maybe this is how kids talked. I don't think this holds true today.<br /><br />3. Storyline painfully predictable.<br /><br />4. Being repeatedly smacked over the head with the deeper meaning and take away messages. First it's hinted at and you get it, and you're like hey that's cool. Then it just keeps being shoved at you until you're told point-blank. Can we tone that down a few notches? I wanna read and find the symbolism and feel kinda smart for catching on, you know? It feels preachy. John Green is incredibly thoughtful and has some interesting perspectives that come off great in a 3 and a half minute video, but it's a bit much for a novel. If my memory serves me right, he may be getting better at this though.<br /><br />I think that's the crux of it really. John Green has an idea and he wants to give it to you and that's what his books are about. His characters are simply vessels to convey the message. To his credit, I think he tries to make his characters distinguishable (as seen by their interesting quirks), but it just doesn't make them feel real. We as readers want them to feel real. We want a story with an exciting plot. John Green wants to convey his thoughts on a certain idea through the medium of novel.<br /><br />John Green's characters do not inspire feelings or emotional connection; at best it is intellectual connection, but too obvious. You don't feel a fondness for them as you would the brazen Scout of To Kill a Mockingbird. Your heart does not rend in pity for them like poor Holden Caufield. Slaughterhouse Five for me was intellectually stimulating more than anything else, but since it was so intriguing and subtle I think that's what distinguishes it positively from John Green who has a very straight-forward and underlined POINT. I don't mean to sound pretentious with my references, but to me John Greenis much more comparable with those than Harry Potter or Hunger Games, you know? His inspiration and drive is idea rather than epic story.<br /><br />I don't know. I do know I can't really critique helpfully or intelligently. What I know is my gut reactions as a reader, how I feel. And I felt ok. Ok, it was kinda fun. It passed the time.<br /><br />What did I like about John Green's book? John Green does a fantastic job naming. Interesting-but-normal-but-have-purpose names. Also, I did like the thoughtful bits in his book, I just didn't like when it became way too apparent what he was trying to say.<br /><br />tl;dr: I recommend this book for a Saturday afternoon."
2028,5,"I haven't read the book yet, and I may not be able to for a variety of reasons. I don't feel rage about anything in American public policy. The disparity between American prosperity and relative poverty of the rest of the world makes effective formation of a planetary government impossible. President Obama's sin, in my view, is that he doesn't have the plain courage to say that closing this gap is needed for a planetary government to be established. He uses misdirection and deceit. He may be enraged, but he can't claim honesty."

2030,5,This book is short and to the point. It covers four version control systems with detailed examples. It contains enough to get a good sense of each system.

2035,5,"I had the pleasure of meeting Melanie several times over the past few years. What drew me to her initially was her work, so detailed, so personal, so unique. In this book, she shares many of her techniques in ways that invites the reader to use them as a launch pad for their own work. Unlike most how to beading books, this one offers projects that when made will be extremely personal, as the main components will be of one's own choosing. I read through it in one sitting and then searched out small pieces of loved but no longer used jewelry, old watches, and things that could be used to create my first mixed media pieces. Melanie gave very clear instructions along with easy to understand pictures. This is a book I will cherish above all others for the beautiful photography, and as a connection to a much loved and innovative beader, whom l miss very much"

2039,3,"The case of Thomas Jeremiah, from what little is known of it, sounds fascinating. He lived in South Carolina in the 1770s, one of only about 500 or so free blacks in the entire state. Somehow he was able to claw his way upward, profiting from his skill as a ship's pilot, and by the time of his death he was one of the richest black men in the North American colonies, worth the equivalent of $200,000 in modern money. As the epilogue notes, he \\""did not need to gather arms or preach revolution to undermine slavery, because his whole life was a refutation of whites' basic justification for slavery.\\"" Then he was accused of trying to incite a slave insurrection, duly framed in a slave court in spite of his status as a free man, and executed in short order.<br /><br />It's a great, multilayered and tragic story, and it would make a great novel or movie. The problem is, the life and death of Thomas Jeremiah is simply not well-documented enough to make a full-length nonfiction book out of. Most of the records of his trial have been lost. We don't know anything about his personal life, who his wife was, whether she was born free or not, or if they had kids. There are no records about his property, either, though it is known that he was himself a slaveowner. (I wonder how he justified that to himself?)<br /><br />That doesn't matter much to Dr. Harris, though, who uses the case as a jumping-off point to discuss larger issues. The Hanging of Thomas Jeremiah might best be summarized like this: \\""This is how the sociopolitical climate was in Charleston, South Carolina just before the American Revolution broke out. Oh, and a guy named Thomas Jeremiah was hanged.\\"" The book isn't about the hanged man at all; he isn't even discussed in detail until over 90 pages in. I feel deceived.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong -- this is a good history book about South Carolina around the time of the Revolution, and in particular about the slavery issue. But I didn't want to read about that. I wanted to read about a particular historical criminal case and miscarriage of justice, which is what the title and jacket flap promised and didn't deliver.to read about a particular historical criminal case and miscarriage of justice, which is what the title and jacket flap promised and didn't deliver."

2043,5,"Written in 1894 and published as part of \\""Plays Pleasant\\"" in 1898, \\""Candida\\"" is one of Shaw's earliest plays, although it wasn't performed until a decade after he wrote it. It is a comedy involving that oldest of dramas: a love triangle. Morell and his wife, Candida, are a seemingly contented married couple unsettled by the arrival of Morrell's prot&eacute;g&eacute;, who becomes a competitor for Candida's affections. Although Shaw skirts the issue of actual adultery, the unconcealed duel between Morrell and the young Eugene Marchbanks over the trophy of Candida is, well, awkward. And adding to the discomfort is the manner in which Candida serves as a mother-figure to both Morrell and Marchbanks, each of whom is described as \\""a great baby\\"" during the course of the play. \\""You are my wife, my mother, my sisters: you are the sum of all loving care to me,\\"" exclaims Morell. (Paging Dr. Freud!)<br /><br />It is instructive to read \\""Candida\\"" and Ibsen's \\""A Doll's House\\"" back to back. Both are attacks on Victorian-era morality, but Shaw inverts Ibsen's household drama into a comedy; in fact, \\""A Domestic Comedy\\"" was the original subtitle before he changed it to \\""A Mystery\\"" to underscore the ambiguity of the play's ending. Shaw himself later stated, on several occasions, that \\""Candida\\"" was written as \\""a counter blast to Ibsen's `Doll House,' showing that in the real typical doll's house it is the man who is the doll.\\"" (Some critics think \\""Candida\\"" borders on parody.) And in a 1937 theater program, he wrote, \\""the cards are not packed against the husband as in Ibsen's play [and] it is his wife who runs the establishment.\\"" Shaw does not see women as \\""the weaker sex\\""; in fact, it is her husband who is quite explicitly the \\""weaker\\"" of the pair, while Eugene is the \\""strange, shy youth of eighteen, slight, effeminate, with a delicate childish voice, and a hunted and tormented expression and shrinking manner.\\""<br /><br />Although indisputably a classic of the theater, \\""Candida\\"" doesn't read quite as fluidly on the page as do some of Shaw's later plays; the clash between the two men is faintly ludicrous; their dialogue too mannered. It has survived more as a vehicle for (excellent) actors rather than as a book to be read. Don't get me wrong: it is still a great play, the character of Candida makes up for the shortcomings of her baby-men, and the ending is perfectly and appropriately ambiguous. And there's enough barbed social commentary and trademark Shavian wit to keep most readers happy, including this exchange:  \\""Oh, well, if you want original conversations, you'd better go and talk to yourself.\\"" \\""That is what all poets do: they talk to themselves out loud; and the world overhears them.\\"" That might as well be Shaw describing his own work.as fluidly on the page as do some of Shaw's later plays; the clash between the two men is faintly ludicrous; their dialogue too mannered.

2044,5,I bought this book based on the reviews on Amazon and was not disappointed!!  I read it in one day and was enthralled the entire time!  This is the first book I've read by Jio and it won't be the last.  The story just captivated me from the beginning to the end and through all the twists and turns.

2045,5,"Laurie King has done it again - another exceptional novel in the Holmes-Russell series. Although not absolutely necessary, I do recommend that one reads the fifth book in the series, \\""O Jerusalem,\\"" before reading \\""Justice Hall.\\""  The major characters in \\""O Jerusalem\\"" - Holmes, Russell, Mahmoud, and Ali - are again the central characters in \\""Justice Hall;\\"" consequently, a better understanding of their background and their relationship from the prior book will lead to a greater understanding of the revelations of these characters of Justice Hall.<br /><br />Holmes and Russell have just returned home from a long adventure in Dartmoor. They had been summoned to solve a mystery regarding strange sightings of a mysterious coach of glowing bones and, of course, a large, monstrous dog (from \\""The Moor\\"").  Their homecoming relaxation is shattered when an injured Ali, one of the two Arab guides from \\""O Jerusalem,\\"" unexpectedly appears at the home of Holmes and Russell. \\""You must help me,\\"" Ali says, as his collapses.  Later, they are both surprised to discover that their former \\""Arab\\"" companions were really a Duke and his cousin, Ali - or should we say, Alistair.  Alistair is concerned about Marsh - Mahmoud - and wants Mary and Holmes to help him save Marsh: from what is the question? What we have is a great story where all is not as it appears to be, which is very ironic as our four main characters fit that very statement.  An entangled mystery of \\""false faces\\"" abound which deal with British aristocracy, execution, rightful heirs, and murder. A web is spun that extends from the English countryside to London, Paris, WWI, and a sea journey to the New World.<br /><br />Laurie King, one of my favorite contemporary authors, has an uncanny ability to simply paint with words; her descriptions are marvelous and realistic, her diction fits the time period, and therefore the reader can \\""see\\"" the characters, their actions, and feel the cramped stairs in the old passages.  King's descriptive powers portray an amazingly realistic portrayal of the old English manor house - Justice Hall. Her description of the house and its old rooms and secret passages - cobwebs and old candle stubs - keeps the reader involved. King has developed in this series, two characters that you actually care about and that you are interested in what happens to them. If you are a Sherlockian or if you simply enjoy a good mystery, I strongly recommend you read this writer and this series about Sherlock Holmes and Mary Russell."
2046,5,"Douglas Wood has his own Walden-like retreat.  It's a cabin on an island in Rainy Lake, at the edge of the Minnesota-Ontario border, \\""Deep in the heart of the North Woods.\\""  This remote site offers not only personal sanctuary, but also a variety of natural scenery to explore, both on land and by water.  It seems like a perfect, idyllic place.<br /><br />In this collection of short essays, Wood invites us to visit the area for a while.  We walk alongside him, and we help to paddle his canoe.  We listen as he shares interesting past encounters with the land or with its inhabitants.  Fairly soon we realize that the man's got a subtle sense of humor.  The sign on his outhouse even reads \\""The Church of Peace.\\""  He also has an easy-going, casual style of storytelling.  His quick monologues cover such topics as fishing, boating, camping, splitting wood, and even feeding cat food to a wild fox.  He pokes fun at himself, thinking of tours he once conducted as a paid wilderness guide, when he would point out to unsuspecting tourists features like the \\""Glacial Eroticas.\\""  These are fun stories to hear.<br /><br />He can also be uniquely spiritual on occasion.  Some of his experiences lead him to call upon the wisdom of the Native Americans or the Zen Buddhists.  And above all else, Douglas Wood is an optimistic man.  It's refreshing to meet one.<br /><br />Author Wood provides for us a delightful read on these pages.  He warns us in the preface that \\""Rusticating on an island roost can sometimes lead to Serious Thoughts.  And sometimes not.\\""  We find both here in \\""Fawn Island,\\"" the book.  It's an exploration of both place and self."
2047,3,"Dr. Drew is right.  The current level of narcissism isn't natural and there are consequences to ignoring narcissism - it spreads.  The Mirror Effect arms you with an understanding of the narcissistic behavior so you can attempt to keep yourself and loved ones from getting affected.  Narcissism is devastating because the consequences of extreme behavior.<br /><br />The narcissism of celebrity culture has reached critical mass.  Narcissists are drawn towards fame.  Earlier celebrities were regulated to a certain extend by major studios that demanded celebrities follow the rules and confirm to some behavior standards (almost like a normal job).  Modern celebrities aren't controlled (protected) by the studio, to maintain their fame they need attention.  Acting out gets our attention.<br /><br />Dr. Drew's explanation of narcissism is useful.  The narcissist creates a pseudo-self, a perfect version.  What the narcissist fears most is that others will see through their pseudo-self and discover their flaws.  As a result, narcissists refuse accept reality and susceptible to addictions that offers an escape.<br /><br />Social mimicry means celebrity behavior spreads.  In order to gain social acceptance, we mimic the behavior of the most powerful in the group.  Mimicking celebrity behavior seems reasonable - it worked for them, it should work for us.  How damaged celebrities are is hidden.<br /><br />The correlation between talent and fame is weakening.  Celebrities have become famous just for their behavior, acting famous.  Now everyone has a chance to become famous, reality television and the web give us all that opportunity. For readers interested in reading more about how our behavior on the web lacks empathy, I recommend Virtually You.  Even submitting this review, believing my opinion is important enough for others to read, is a narcissistic act.<br /><br />Dr. Drew's discussion of how prone teens are to narcissistic behavior highlights research done in the childhood development. We are all born narcissists, it is important to help kids mature out of it.  As teens we are particularly susceptible to short-term thinking and risk taking.  This may have served to spur our ancestors to leave their original tribe or compete for status within the tribe.  The characteristics leave teens vulnerable to social influence - marketers know this and target teens.  Is the emphasis of achievement at the detriment of what children really need - emotional development?<br /><br />I only gave three stars because of the documentation of celebrity narcissism is excessive.  I didn't feel each example had unique benefit - near the end they blended together.  I started skipping sections, looking for the stuff that applied to me, the average Joe copy cat."
2048,5,"I read over a hundred books annually for my NPR affiliated radio show, and \\""Going to Solace\\"" is one of the best novels I have read this year.<br /><br />In the rural Carolinas of 1989, things move at a different pace and folks either know each other--or know of each other. In just five days (including Thanksgiving) first-time novelist Amanda McTigue lets us get to know and care about the people who work, visit and reside in a Blue Ridge Mountain hospice home known simply as Solace. The residents are mostly old and worn out, the visitors are on edge from the uncertain finality of what will come soon, and the dedicated caregivers may have seen it all before, but are still deeply involved. I know you will get involved as well.<br /><br />I read it on my computer, and although that works, it would be much cozier reading \\""Going to Solace\\"" as a \\""real\\"" book. It just fits better with the story, characters, time and place."
2049,4,"The first half of this book is a textbook on how intelligence services operate.  Written by a former CIA member it's quite an interesting read - if of course you are interested in the subject.  It does read like a textbook in many places, as a warning to those looking for a spy novel.  Having said that the second half of the book is the author recounting his experience running CIA ops in Hungary post WW II.  This makes up for the dryness of the earlier chapters as well as providing practical examples as to what the author has been talking about.  The second half id the desert after dinner."
2050,4,"This is the first Sax Rohmer Fu Manchu mystery and Titan Books promises to release them all. Everyone has heard of Fu but few have read of his crimes, This book was originally a few short stories strung together but it does not read that way. Though the mysteries are sometimes easy to solve, the action moves at such a pace that what you figured out no longer matters. Fu Manchu is smart, deadly, and a threat to Western Society. Nayland Smith is nearly as smart, and is dedicated to saving civilization from a new Ghengis Khan. Naturally they clash, and when they do, many die--police, civilians, scientists, and archeologists are particularly vulnerable to what amounts to terrorist attacks.<br /><br />Like all novels written a century ago, knowledge of history is helpful, but not necessary. Like Sherlock Holmes, Fu Manchu has become a pop culture icon--but on the bad guy side. Good, stiff-upper-lip fun."
2051,5,"It's the best of the Walking Dead paperbacks so far, which is great because the last few volumes were boring me.<br />As I'm sure the other reviewers have indicated, it has the best action sequence in a Walking Dead book/comic to date."
2052,5,"If you love Southern cooking, especially dessert, you need to read this book!<br /><br />Each section starts out with a short story by Amy Wilson. The stories give a little background and create a setting in which one might serve the recipes that follow. The stories told are entertaining and help take this cook book to another level; a step above your standard cookbook with just recipes and pictures. I really wish there was more to read about the characters introduced, but since this is a cookbook and not a novel I guess I'll just take what I can get.<br /><br />When I opened the book to the table of contents, I was shocked at the amount of recipes this book contains. There are ten chapters and each one of the contains 15-20 recipes. I'll let you do the math, but trust me...that's a lot of recipes!!!  Patsy Caldwell must have given away every secret family recipe in this book. There were only a handful of recipes that didn't appeal to me and that's just because of my taste preferences; there wasn't anything that seemed downright nasty. Here are a few of the recipes that stood out to me: Sara's Peanut Brittle, Lemon-Raspeberry Cupcakes with Lemon Icing, Homemade Caramel Candy and Old Fashioned Southern Chess Pie. One of my favorite things about this cook book is that most everything is made from scratch, there aren't too many pre-made ingredients.<br /><br />I can't wait to try some of these recipes. If I get a chance, I'll make sure to post some reviews about them here.<br /><br />Disclaimer: A complimentary copy of this book was provided for review by Thomas Nelson Publishers. All thoughts are my own and I was not required to post a positive review."
2053,5,"In The Mystery of the Missing Mustangs the girls are taken to a Dude Ranch.  They learn all about taking care of horses.  They learn from the bottom up.  They must learn to muck out stalls, feed and care for their horses, then learn to ride.  It is while they are there they meet Devyn the Ranch owner's niece. She is adopting a wild mustang.  There is a problem, Silver Star the horse she is adopting has gone missing along with several other mustangs.  The girls must do their best to help solve this mystery.<br /><br />If you are looking for clean, fun, reads then this is an author you need to check out.  The mysteries are fulfilling, not too hard.  I liked learning about mining and wild mustangs and how they are protected.  These are books that will definitely find a place on my shelves at school."
2054,5,"I could not put this book down and finished it in four hours.  Lance LaCoax's first novel is fast-paced, creepy and an assault on all of the senses - from a ghostly touch on my skin to hearing whispers just outside of reality.  I was seeing moving shadows out of my line of sight for days.  The characters were real.  The dialog was crisp.  And just enough questions went unanswered to leave me clamoring for the sequel (A sneak peek is available at the end of the book).<br /><br />What else do you need?  Just buy the book."
2055,5,"Simply put, Otto Carius is NOT a writer. I've seen more than a few complaints about the writing style, Otto Carius is NOT a writer. Tigers In The Mud was written originally for former soldiers of the 502ND as well as other German tankers. Taking this into account, it's a fantastic book. Carius does an amazing job of telling how he, and fellow members of the 502ND felt. He includes a few maps that go along with his story as well as a few photos of him, his crew and their surroundings; plus the addition of more than a few documents from Carius' time on the front (they're translated on the next page with a near identical document)."
2056,5,"Here is a book that is clearly written, easy to understand and<br />irrefutable to the rational mind.  It covers a broad canvas from<br />the problems with economic theories all the way to an examination<br />of what we can expect in the future, which is now, though most<br />people refuse to realize it, or simply try to ignore it.  Three<br />centuries of industrial \\""improvements\\"", using fossil fuels have produced a \\""religious\\"" belief in the undying continuation of \\""progress.\\""<br />But the earth is now reacting to the human treatment of limited resources<br />as though they were eternal and unlimited. This is a fine complement to the works of Wendell Berry. There is also a most interesting discussion<br />of the law of entropy, with which we should all acquaint ourselves<br />as it pertains to matter and enegry. A most important and persuasive book.<br />A final most important insight lies in this book: the reader will realize<br />the impass in our politcs today can only be met by a COMPROMISE in which<br />both \\""sides\\"" admit to begin immediately the painful and most difficult<br />changes in our way of living by weaning ourselves from fossil fuels and<br />starting to use sustainability and renewal enegry at whatever the costs to our vaunted devotion to technological progress while ignoring  the human and natural costs."
2057,3,"Stuck in the life and style section of the New Orleans Times-Picayune, Nola Cespedes dreams of becoming a real report covering crime stories. Her break comes when the editor assigns her an investigative story about how sex offenders cope with reintegration into society and having to register. Taking the story plunges Nola into an underworld that becomes increasingly dark and threatening.<br /><br />On the positive side, the scenes of New Orleans are vivid, full of the life of that city in the post Katrina world. The book is worth reading for a glimpse of the recovering city. Nola is an interesting character. She takes us into her life and makes it come alive. I wish the other characters were a bit more well drawn. They were more like a background for Nola's ruminations.<br /><br />One of the major negatives was Nola's reporting skills. Her interviews read like an information dump with little interaction between her and the subject. They just didn't feel real. In fact, much of the book felt as if Castro had started out to write an article about sex offenders and turned it into a novel.<br /><br />I found the ending not quite in line with the opening. When we spend as much time in a character's head as we do with Nola it seems a bit like cheating to have a whole set of motives come out at the end. However, it did wrap the story up in a satisfactory finale.<br /><br />The book was an interesting read, particularly the glimpses New Orleans life and the way the Latinos see the city. It's worth reading for that aspect. Shifting tenses back and forth to try to give an illusion of immediacy is a bit disconcerting. However, there are many good parts to the book, particularly if you're interested in New Orleans."
2058,5,"My copy of this book is now dogeared and tattered. I didn't write in it and I cannot tell you why. I guess I didn't want my words cluttering his. I know the book was a popular success spending some time on the New York Times Bestseller List. Typically I eschew anything on that list (It's a psychic echo of my Gen-X 1990's. I apologize for it regularly.). Not this time.<br /><br />There are many reasons I've enjoyed this book. I'll be candid. That I am from Richmond, VA, lived in Chicago, IL, and presently reside in Berkeley, CA made reading this book a special experience. Crawford lives in Richmond, lived in Chicago and was raised in Berkeley. I knew every corner and streetscape. I knew where he wrote about. I knew those places and I guess that's the point. Knowing.<br /><br />Shop Class as Soulcraft by Matthew B. Crawford is a book (originally an essay) about work. Sure. \\""An inquiry into the value of work\\"" says the subtitle. Yep. It is. It's more profoundly about how we know what we know and the ethics of the same. Ethics are Crawford's soulcraft. Who we are, how we come to know our world, and how we value such knowing is a measure of soulfulness (the ethics of metacognition, he calls it).<br /><br />He critiques the American educational system as well as our incessant need to turn every kind of work into an assembly line. Whether it is Ford or Apple, innovation comes from craftwork but industry demands cogs and wheels and knowledgework turns human minds into cogs. No one needs to be a craftsperson any longer. We don't value it. One merely needs to know one's place in the assembly line. Our schools train us to value this \\""non-thinking.\\"" Our schools systems, the administrators and politicians who run them have eliminated shop class right along side art and music. We don't value these kinds of thinking. They are slow and cumbersome. And yet, to paraphrase Crawford, they are perhaps the deepest expressions of our souls.<br /><br />So, here's another confession of sorts. This is the book I want to write about liturgy. This. This is it. Liturgy is a soulcraft. It's a way of thinking, of problem solving. Individual craftwork in the midst of a community of craftworkers taking as long as it takes to work their way through to the stated goal. It's slow and cumbersome. It takes time to learn and master. It takes time to practice. One reason we struggle with liturgy is because we have not been taught to value it. In fact, we have been taught to value it's opposite which in turn compells us to fashion liturgies that are more like concerts or spiritual assembly lines. Plug us in and crank us out. \\""Just add water.\\"" What kind of Baptismal ecclesiology is that? What are the ethics motivating how we think about liturgy? What are our actual values? Alacrity? Entertainment? Salvation? We need to ask ourselves these questions.<br /><br />Crawford is more interested in problem solving than I might be, but I understand where he's coming from and it's not too strange to think of liturgy as a problem of sorts. It may not be troublesome, but there are pieces that go together and no matter how concretized our liturgy may be (See: a Catholic missal or the Episcopal Book of Common Prayer), our communities, their abilities, and the spaces in which they worship demand a certain improvisation, a certain problem solving and thinking.<br /><br />I could write a book about the book and I guess that's the highest compliment I could pay.<br /><br />Soulcraft.

2059,3,"First off, Elton John is my favorite musical artist. It took me only a couple of hours to read this book (wide margins!). I admire Elton greatly for his work through the Elton John AIDS Foundation. Elton certainly proves he knows his facts and figures when it comes to AIDS throughout the world. His positive spirit and energy are to be commended. However, after a while the statitics become numbing. I would have preferred more personal stories, both of Elton's life and those he has encountered through his work with EJAF. So I rate this as only a mediocre book. However, proceeds from this book go to EJAF which does much good in the fight to eradicate AIDS."
2060,5,"I admit. My knowledge of the early 20th century Red Sox is limited. Some of it's not my fault. There's not a lot of information that has survived. And, what little is available has been shoved down my throat continuously. (If I hear one more time why Nuf Ced McGreevy was called Nuf Ced, I may choke on my Red Sox Nation membership card.) But, this book escapes that trap. It was a thrilling read. It followed the 1912 series so it felt like I was there. I was anxious when the games were close, and pleased when the Red Sox came out on top. It was fascinating to see how all the players interacted with each other. Vaccaro didn't hold anything back. Gamblers were mentioned as willingly as Gamers. It really felt like I was in a time machine transported back almost 100 years to one of the most exciting events I could see. I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't read this book. Do yourself a favor and pick it up."
2061,2,"The other reviewers do a good job of summarizing the plot of this novel, so I will not go into those details.  My one compliment to this book is that the truths of the Catholic faith are presented honestly as the young man struggles to defend his beliefs against many common misconceptions and accusations.<br /><br />As a story itself, however, the novel is trite and irritating.  I really wanted to connect to this young man who lost his father, but the characters of the young man, his dead father, his mother and siblings were too idyllically drawn to be real.  While I know many good Catholics and happy families, I could not relate to the O'Sheas of this book as they seemed so cloyingly perfect.  I couldn't finish this book and I wouldn't even consider handing it to one of my teenagers.  Perhaps those who live in a Catholic \\""bubble\\"" might find this novel interesting.  I, for one, would rather study the catechism with my children to deepen our faith and then, when reading time comes, encourage my children to crack open novels with well-developed, complex and compelling characters, settings and plots. This novel is not one of those."
2062,5,"Buy this book! You will not be disappointed! Derek Ciccone is a talented author. I love his books - interesting plot, extensive character development - it was difficult for me to put this book down once I started to read it!"
2063,5,"The text is an easy read and contains many interesting stories in the mass media world, a must read for journalists."
2064,5,I was looking for a book to read on my Kindle and I found Demon Kiss. I started to read it and I couldn't put it down. H.M. Ward makes a story about a girl who's life changes one night from a kiss and turns it into an epic story. I enjoyed that the reader doesn't see what is going to happen next because a lot of book have become predictable. After reading this book you can't wait to jump into the next one of the series.
2065,4,"Zach Wahls skyrocketed to fame in 2011 when, at the age of 19, he testified before the Iowa House Judiciary Committee regarding a proposed constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. He stood up in defence of his family, of his two lesbian moms, and of himself as a child of gay parents who turned out just fine after all. \\""If I was your son, Mr. Chairman,\\"" he said. \\""I believe I'd make you very proud.\\"" His testimony was uploaded to YouTube and went viral almost instantly.<br /><br />My Two Moms is about Zach Wahls' family. It's about what led up to his testimony in Iowa. But mostly it's about Zach Wahls, a twenty-year-old who has had, for the most part, an incredibly easy life. Yes, he's had some instances of embarrassment over having gay parents (my mom's not gay and I spent half my childhood being embarrassed by her for one reason or another--that's what kids do) and he's experienced the incredible pain of seeing one of his parents battle a serious illness (his mom Terri has MS, which is definitely painful for the whole family, but this kind of hardship is certainly not exclusive to gay parents). In fact, if you were to describe Zach Wahls based on the characteristics that are most important to who he is, you'd probably say he's a twenty-year-old student, an Eagle Scout (he mentions that on nearly every page of the book), a giant nerd (he comes by it honestly--his parents walked down the aisle to the theme from Star Trek Voyager), a child of loving parents, a debate champion, a minor internet celebrity and budding entrepreneur, and oh yeah, his moms are gay.<br /><br />The result of writing an autobiography when you're twenty years old and have had such perfectly pleasant life so far is that you quickly run out of things to say. Wahls often waxes poetic on the great questions of life--love, dating, politics, religion, human nature--and the result is about what you would expect from somebody who was still a teenager a month or so ago. It's optimistic and overly confident, the writing of someone certain he has it all figured out because he's, well, twenty frigging years old. At other times he tries to fill out the book with tales of childhood trauma. There's nearly an entire chapter devoted to a bad dream he used to have about a velociraptor. It's a pretty charmed life you've led if when pressed for tales of woe you start with, \\""There was this bad dream I used to have...\\""<br /><br />But I guess that's sort of the point. Zach Wahls hasn't had a hard life. He hasn't even had a particularly interesting life (sorry Zach, I don't mean you're boring, nor is your book boring). He's just really, really normal. He's a straight guy raised by two gay moms and he's absolutely normal. He's definitely better adjusted than I was at twenty (or thirty). The fact that he was raised by loving parents has everything to do with who he is. The fact that those parents are two lesbians seems a LOT more important to everyone else than it is to him.<br /><br />For more reviews, visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received a digital galley of this book free from Edelweiss (Above the Tree Line).

2066,5,"Richard Montanari is one of my favorite serial killer authors, and this book Play Dead is one of his better entries.  A \\""Byrne-Balzano\\"" mystery (two Philadelphia, PA detective partners that reappear in other novels), the story hops around between them, the killer and various other characters such as the teenage runaways who become the killer magician's prey.  Montanari is a terrific storyteller, and you find yourself wanting to keep reading the book by the midnight oil because it is so engrossing and hard to put down.  I would also recommend Merciless/Broken Angels (same book, one title released in U.S.A, one in U.K.) which has a similar fascinating deranged killer who is acting out fairytales.  A word of caution - most of Montanari's books are now published in England, so you will notice many sellers of this book are from the U.K., which may delay shipping time unless you find one from the U.S., or if Amazon fulfils the order."
2067,4,"I'm a fan of Nancy Kress's how-to books for Writer's Digest Press. Some of these books are better than others. I particularly like \\""Beginnings, Middles, and Ends.\\"" This book, \\""Dynamic Characters,\\"" is excellent for beginning writers, who might be overwhelmed with more complex books. Step by step, Kress introduces firsts the externals of creating believable characters, then the internals, and, finally, the connections between plot and character. All in all, worth reading and consulting."
2068,5,This book has ton's of information for the lay person regarding medications/dosing instructions and things to be aware of. I bought an older edition of this book back when I was in school and then again several years later after my sister had major surgery and was on several different medications for her to understand the medications she was taking.
2069,5,"This is an amazing book about an amazing place. Not only does it give a short history and background of the area, it lists and shows drawings or photos of many of the flora and fauna of the region. Everything is covered, with only a few exceptions. No one who travels to this unique shoreline should be with out this book."
2070,5,"The book was incredible!  Very hard to put down once I started reading and look forward to other installments!  The writing was amazing, and explains in great detail everything that goes on."
2071,5,"If I was writing a television commercial for men, I would probably place the setting on a football field with two teams facing one another on the 50-yard line and men jumping and screaming cheers for their team. \\""10 Life-Charged Words: Real Faith for Men\\"" is a book that will inspire men to \\""jump and scream cheers\\"" for thier Christian faith. Derek's words give men permission to be excited about the Jesus we claim and how the Gospel of Jesus Christ is relevant in the 21st Century. This is a book for every man who is \\""timid\\"" about their faith and wondering how to be a man of faith in an ever-changing world. Once again, Derek has written a \\""road map\\"" for men to follow and share with a confident and authentic Christian understanding. Men ... it is time for Extreme Faith and Bold Action in our Christian walk with one another and the world. This is the book that will unite generations of brothers, fathers, and sons, with Jesus and the future of our faith."
2072,5,"I almost laughed when I was handed the massive book and was told I have to read this. I sucked it up and sat down to what I thought was going to be 2+ months of of a novel that would just help me fall asleep. I then burned threw the first 300 in less than a week the whole thing in 2. Then I read a small teaser of The Twelve and picked up The Passage and read it again. The first part of the book is better than the last but the characters Cronin created kept me glued to the pages, and the more I read the more I wanted to know more about them. I highly recommend this book anyone into viral/vampire/post apocalyptic or just into reading. Just read the first few chapters, you'll be glad you did."
2073,4,"This book is destined to be a classic.  And it will be talked about for decades, if only because so many people have read it, or at least have it on their shelves.<br /><br />This Time is Different is frighteningly ambitious, and it mostly does a good job synthesizing 800 years of economic data.<br /><br />I feel that the book my be overly classical in its approach.  It lumps in data from the modern, post-Bretton Woods era (1971-) with pre-Bretton Woods data, implicitly suggesting that nothing fundamental changed between these two eras.  My belief is that the post-Bretton Woods era is a starkly different era:  when major countries can print in unlimited quantity and successfully issue debt in their own currency, the old rules really don't apply.  Rogoff and Reinhart rely on classical arguments which suggest that nothing too fundamental changed during the post Bretton Woods era; money creation by central authorities has always been present, they suggest, and a change in the potential degree of money creation doesn't really alter the economics fundamentally.  Money creation by central authorities was going on in medieval times and before.<br />I can't help but feel, however, that if you're writing a book on the macroeconomic implications of debt and money creation, you have to be leading readers astray by lumping all your data together and treating all different types of regimes as essentially similar.  A more nuanced view would show that the macroeconomic implications of debt differ substantially depending on the type of economy and the time period (pre-1971 economies that issue debt in foreign currency look different than pre-1971 economies that issue debt in home currency, and both look far different than post-1971 economies that issue debt in home currency)."
2074,3,"I remember getting horned up looking at the VERY explicit comics of Tom of Finland back in the '80s. I loved those over sized magazine type comics. They were more fun than Playgirl ever could be. The hot and very overly endowed men that graced the pages of Tom of Finland were my dream/fantasy men. The comics were very explicit in nature where as the ones in this book are not as hardcore. It is still a good book, but would have liked to have seen his \\""harder\\"" drawings.

It is hard to read becuase a 5 year old is telling the story and cannot speak in complete sentences.  ALso, it is a disturbing story that doesnt make me want to read more.  Dont read unless you want a depressing, sad, hard book to read."

What was originally intended to be a humanitarian mission by the Bush administration became a disastrous attempt at \\""nation building\\"" during the early years of the Clinton presidency.<br /><br />Author Mark Bowden exhaustively researched the actions of Task Force Ranger and their opponents in the Habr Gibr clan in Mogadishu, Somalia utilizing FOIA to obtain DOD documents, video and audio records as well as interviews with participants on both sides. He paints a bloody picture of political wrangling, African clan warfare, face-to-face combat as well as professionalism and courage. We read of a US military that made a terrible mistake - underestimating one's opponent and paying the price.<br /><br />The author recounts the actions of many men on both sides in an almost minute-by-minute fashion as the operation proceeds over a period of only a few days. This is eyeball-level combat where the author writes in a no-holds-barred fashion. He gives the reader an excellent sense of the intense and bloody nature of combat at street level.<br /><br />This is an excellent history book that reads like a novel! Mark Bowden is a brilliant author that will leave the reader turning pages to the exclusion of everything else around them! Impossible to put down!<br /><br />The military reader will be able to clearly draw conclusions even though the author maintains a neutral tone and writing style. Clearly, the US military underestimated and misunderstood their opponents. The reader will cringe while reading how the US military did things which made the local population look upon them as an oppressive invader. What the Somalis lacked in skill and weaponry they more than made up for in numbers and determination. At the same time, the reader will marvel at the professional skill of the men of Delta Force and the Rangers fighting overwhelming numbers of angry, highly-motivated opponents. Additionally, we see the overdependence of the US military on high-tech equipment (like the helicopters that were more vulnerable than the US military thought) instead of tactics and devolving problem solving to the men on the spot.<br /><br />This is an excellent book that looks at the battle in Mogadishu from many different and opposing points of view. I recommend this book with five stars.nally, we see the overdependence of the US military on high-tech equipment (like the helicopters that were more vulnerable than the US military thought) instead of tactics and devolving problem solving to the men on the spot.<br /><br />This is an excellent book that looks at the battle in Mogadishu from many different and opposing points of view.

2079,2,"This is my first review but I was compelled to write because I felt mislead by the book jacket which compares Camilla Lackberg to Stieg Larsson and Henning Mankell. My real beaf is not so much with her as with those who compare her to Larsson and Mankell. She is very simply not in their league and to suggest otherwise does her an injustice. She is a beginning writer and this is her first novel. It really should be read as such. The novel lacks depth and complexity and is not particularly well written. I applaud her effort to take on some difficult subjects - child sexual abuse, family secrets, and domestic abuse. She has some promise but a long way to go."
2080,5,Great story that will appeal to all ages! The writer uses a lot of music references which I found to make it very easy to relate to the characters. Plenty of twists to keep in interesting! This is not your typical good vs evil story! I can definitely close my eyes and picture a movie coming from this one!!  Pick up this book today!!!
2081,5,"I've only read the Bible more than this book. Searching for questions, a friend offered this book to me. I must admit, hesitation was my best friend at the time. I immediately thought of the movie \\""she's out of control\\"" staring Tony Danza. He had a teenage daughter who was starting to grow out of control, so Tony character turned to a radio psychologist, whom offered him sound advice about parenting. How funny the dialogued played out, but the more advice tony received the worse is relationship with is daughter developed, until finally tony asked the doctor, do these methods work with your own daughter? The doctor replied, \\""I don't even have children\\"". That's where my dilemma began, i wanted advice and knowledge, but i was careful from where. Then i realized that anything better than what i knew couldn't be bad. So i read Emotionally healthy children. This book will not only make you a better parent, but a person in whole. We could easily call this book raising an emotionally healthy world. Who doesn't want to feel respected or included? i recommend this book to anyone whether you have children or not. Rarely do we make conscious decision, for we live by programmed memory, this book however forces your mind to think and create new strategies to interact with your children. you may not believe this book is perfect for parenting, however, i trust each page will have you challenging the idea of perfecting your parenting. Parents are children first teachers, why shouldn't we have the right curriculum to teach from. Thank you Dr. Gerald Newmark, your book has help me immensely."
2082,3,"With the unwavering praise this book gets, I expected it to be awesome. I love some of Plato's other works - Philebus, Apology, etc. This just didn't do much for me. There are definitely some great points in the book, and it is written pretty well, but at the beginning of book 9 it started to get a little boring, and more than anything I just really couldn't take Plato's philosophical babble anymore. He is in another world in this book (La-La Land). I agree with Aristotle that it is a joke in that it was meant by Plato to be taken seriously (at least politically). I liked it for its writing style as well as individual philosophy. My advice is to read it simply for enjoyment and to pick out the useful philosophical points."
2083,4,"This is a simple, entertaining mystery about Bill Reyner, a young man whose parents were deceased and he quit college after two years, went to work for a gas station fifty hours a week working like a slave.  He didn't know what to do with his life.  His Granny Hubert sought him out and took him home with her.  Bill's Uncle Edgar Reyner, who made fortunes and spent them just as fast, had died in what appeared to be an accidental explosion on his boat.  A law firm in Canada notified Granny and Bill to appear in their offices for the reading of Edgar's Will.  Besides other minor beneficiaries, Uncle Edgar bequeathed Granny Hubert $50,000 plus an interest in Saucer's Island on Lake Huron and William $3.5 million dollars plus the balance of the interest in the island and its contents.<br /><br />Granny and William learned that a rumor lasting two hundred years said that Jeremiah Fiend and his seven sons had raided an American boat and stolen ten tons of gold.  Thereafter, the seven sons died and Jeremiah hid the gold somewhere on the island.  Several different owners had owned the island during those two hundred years and several of them died mysteriously as if Jeremiah haunted the island, protecting his gold.  Bill talked his young friends, Pete, Dee, Henny and Alic, a girl, to join him at his expense on the island while they searched for the gold, as every owner before them had done.<br /><br />On the island stood a large house, four cottages, a boathouse with boat, a nice beach and a beacon on the end of the island.  While Granny, Bill and his friends took charge of the island and its contents, they were joined by a woman named Addy who claimed to be Edgar's old girlfriend.  The mystery ensued as people died seemingly accidental deaths, boats disappeared and Granny and Bill, who wanted to be a P.I. attempted to solve the crimes and locate the gold, if there actually was such.<br /><br />The novel is well written, laid out in such a manner that the reader can remember all of the loose ends, which finishes in naturally a surprise twist.  I recommend it to readers of mystery thrillers.all of the loose ends, which finishes in naturally a surprise twist.  I recommend it to readers of mystery thrillers."
2084,4,"I couldn't decide between 3 or 4 stars.  As usual, Tom weaves a reasonably believable story with a good mix of action and suspense.  However, Tom is evidently a devout Catholic, and this book contains a lot of superfluous detail about the process of selecting a pope and other aspects of the religion.  I found it a good read in spite of that.  If you too are a devout Catholic these parts may be of interest to you, whereas if you have problems with Catholicism or religion in general this may not be a good book for you."
2085,4,"This was a Father's Day gift for my dad. He is enjoying it, especially the fact that it contains short stories of his experiences. Dad is a big reader and if something doesn't resonate with him, he stops reading it. He is still working on it, so it's safe to say he is enjoying it."
2086,4,"Page-turning, at times chilling, dystopian YA fiction. The earth's climate warmed generations ago, melting the polar ice caps and resulting in widespread destruction and depopulation. A remnant of the human race has come under the protection of the Earth Mother and her Corporation, who Enclose portions of the remaining islands under domes reminiscent of The Truman Show. While ten-year-old Honor tries to adjust to a new school and life, her parents persist in behaving unconventionally, making her life difficult, a nice twist on the more usual unconventional child complicating the lives of humdrum, conformist parents.<br /><br />I also appreciated that, while Goodman didn't tidy everything up at the end, nor does she seem about to embark on a ten-book YA series. In recent YA, the ability to tell a good story and wind it up in ONE DISCRETE BOOK seems to be a dying art..."
2087,5,"Anna Burroughs Cook, author of Tarot Dynamics, has taken her innovative concept forward and super charged it in her latest offering, Tarot Dynamics Unleashed, published by Kima Global Publishing, 2011.<br /><br />Anna offers a system of learning that can firmly root your readings in the cards, giving your intuition room to work within the system, for readings and timings that are eerily accurate.  While I am aware that some people can do free form tarot readings with great success, my observation of many students and fellow readers has led me to believe most people read and learn most effectively within a system, and the Tarot Dynamics one is great!<br /><br />It seems to be en vogue today to use tarot as only a psychological tool, for insight, to talk about our feelings, but I firmly believe it is also useful as a tool for divination, which simply put, means to tell the future.  Anna makes no apologies for her willingness to predict events, and her system allows for both psychologically based readings as well as fortune telling ones (and it is my belief that a good reading addresses both things, is the Seeker desires).<br /><br />In the Tarot Dynamics system, you will learn a specific number, from 1-78, for each card, and using numerology you will be able to break each card down into a core meaning.  Each card is illustrated with a large black and white image from the Waite Smith deck, and Anna encourages you to place your own card over the image as you study, so that any deck you prefer to use is relate-able to her system.  Anna does something not enough teachers do, in my opinion, which is offer a range of meaning to each card, so there are no \\""good\\"" nor \\""bad\\"" cards.  There are simply cards, and how you string them together depends on their relationship to the other cards in the spread (don't worry; you learn how to do this in the book, too!).<br /><br />There are several spreads in the book, and the best chapter, in my opinion, is Tarot Dynamics & The Moon in Astrology.  There are plenty of books that link tarot and astrology, but few that deal with The Moon, which is the seat of our emotional life, astrologically speaking.  Her view on the Court Cards will help you get a handle on these most slippery of cards, as well, and that is invaluable.<br /><br />If you are like me, with many, many books about tarot, or have been reading for a while, you will want to know why this is a good book for you.  Simply put, one can never have too many tools in the box for reading and interpreting cards, and this book gives a thoughtful, well rounded tool that you can reach for at any time.  A friend and teacher once likened reading tarot to playing a game of 3D chess, and the more techniques you know for interpreting cards the more levels you can play on.<br /><br />If you are new to tarot, this book will give you a firm foundation as to meanings of the cards, and it will help you expand your intuition.  You will be able to relate what you learn in this book to the cards for as long as you are a reader, and it is a good investment in your education.  You don't have to do anything in tarot by anyone elses'  rules but knowledge always equals power, so it is good to learn as much as possible, regardless of your reading level.<br /><br />I recommend this book for tarotistas of any level, and using its' techniques will help you spot patterns and themes in your readings to take them to a new level.  Anna writes in a clear, concise manner that is easy to read, and once you put her words into practice you will understand her concepts.<br /><br />Anna has a great website you can visit, Tarot Dynamics, and runs a group for it on Facebook, if you are so inclined to visit.trology.

2088,5,"The first few chapters of Indigo Springs by A. M. Dellamonica was a little confusing but by the third chapter I was totally hooked. After Astrid's father dies, he leaves her a house that is full of enchanted objects. Astrid begins to uncover the mysteries behind her father as well as unlock memories that have been buried for years. With the help of her brother by marriage, Jacks, and her friend, Sahara, the three embark to uncover the mystery behind the dangerous,blue, magical substance called vitagua.<br />The story is told from two points-of-view from two different people. The first is told from an investigator named Will. The magic that Astrid unlocks wreaks havoc on their community. It's like a whole epidemic has taken over the town and beyond. Astrid is held in a bunker below ground. Will has come to interview her to find out any information on the fugitive, Sahara. The second point-of-view is told from Astrid. She reflects and tells Will the events that has led up to the present day circumstances.<br />Indigo Springs is a well-written novel, full of imagination and complex characters. It is a thoroughly fascinating look into the temptation of power and the consequences of using it for one's own advantage. I was completely caught up in the world that Dellamonica created. This is a book that I would definitely recommend. You won't want to put it down until you reach the end."
2089,5,"On the planet of Cybertron exists life, but not life as we know it, intelligent robots capable of transforming have waged a civil war for millions of years, the Heroic Autobots and the Evil Decepticons struggle-<br /><br />Wait. What? It's over?<br /><br />War is over!<br /><br />...And now it only gets even more intense.<br /><br />In the beginning of 2012, IDW announced Transformers would have not one, but TWO ongoing series, and so, fans didn't know quite what to expect, until it was announced that the talent behind both would reflect the works to follow onward. James Roberts, co-writer of Last Stand of the Wreckers and author of the lauded two parter Chaos Theory story now stands head writer alongside some familiar faces, with fellow Wrecker artist Nick Roche helping in, and IDW regular Alex Milne standing as the mainstay artist!<br /><br />While in Sister series Robots in Disguise, the story is of political intrigue and slow burning thriller, More Than Meets the Eye is a riproaring adventure into space, think Star Trek, but everyone can turn into a car, or a memory stick if you want to stay non-shapist!<br /><br />The reading is light on pages, but each crammed with more depth and entertainment than any ongoing transformers story in possibly 20 years, and from the blast off, the gathering of a crew and the reveal of a terrifying secret aboard the ship, this issue covers the debut of the team, and shapes up well for IDW's future.<br /><br />While 'RiD' boasts a familiar line up, 'MTMTE' is full of new and unexplored characters, ripe for introduction and quick to warm to, and best of all?<br /><br />You don't even have to have read a comic before this to enjoy it.<br /><br />It certainly HELPS, and to assist, also within is penned by Roberts and Co. the one-shot comic 'The Death of Optimus Prime', detailing the wedge driven into the Autobots that has created such a split.<br /><br />The Lost Light is lost, and there's a wide, wide galaxy out there between the crew and their goals.<br /><br />But luckily for us, the adventure is so much more than the destination...<br /><br />Buy it now, and see for yourself if you're willing to join the crew."
2090,5,"All Pro Dad is a terrific choice for Moms and Dads alike. I would encourage both parties to read it. It offers great insights and deep wisdom into the inner working dynamics of family. This book was a key piece to some major changes in our household. I am so glad we got it! Encouraging, directive and resourceful. A fabulous find!!"
2091,3,"I definitely enjoyed the information provided in this book.  It definitely sheds light on aspects of politics I knew were there, but didn't necessarily know to what degree.  When I saw the title of the book, I was definitely intrigued by it considering that I do not like anything that has to do with the federal government, and haven't for the better part of 10 years (basically since I started paying attention to it).  However, after reading this book, I am mildly disapointed because it had nothing to do with the title, as Mr. Schweizer does not say, at any point, to throw everyone out of office.<br /><br />I will definitely credit the author for providing his readers with an extremely informative book, and I enjoyed seeing a great number of politicians being placed in the spotlight.  It is also good to know how lenient regulations are on them with regards to trading stocks.  We sit here and blame one political party or another for taking advantage of us when, in reality, both sides are robbing us blind with their own special interest.  The unfortunate fact is - while the solution to the problem is quite clear - the proposals the author makes about how to solve the issues will never come to fruition if we continue to vote for the same pedigree of politicians come election time.<br /><br />Again, I found this book to be a good read, but I was disappointed because I felt a bit undersold because of the lack of correlation between the title of the book and what was actually presented in the book.  However, for those who are interested in greed as it relates to politics, I would definitely recommend this book for sure."
2092,5,"Great book, plot, nice action. Didn't like Peta too much. The main character made it all worth it for me. Especially liked the intricacy of the \\""games.\\"""
2093,5,Read this book in a day. I could not put down. I love all the characters. I cared about them. There were times I was mad and frustrated and yelling at the characters and other times laughing out loud and times just smiling because I was happy for the characters. This is an easy read and a great one.
2094,2,I got this book because everyone was talking about it and it didn't live up to the hype. It's incohesive and simply written. It almost comes off as if it were written by a child. If you need a quick cheesy read then this is the book for you. But if you are looking for substance stay clear of this one.
2095,5,"Sculptors working from digital clay to create models or monuments should purchase the book just to read the chapters on Digital 3-D Printing and adding color and texture with Photoshop.  The book contains excellent information on Rapid Prototyping, 3-D Printers, 3-D Milling, applications for 3-D printing and milling, preparing ZBrush models for printing and milling, and exporting geometry for printing and milling applications.  The project based learning approach is written for the serious intermediate ZBrush artists.  Scott Spencer demonstrates his creative expertise in the book and on videos in the accompanying DVD.  It is valuable to ZBrush artists who may be focusing on broad market segments in addition to those creating dynamic imagery for film and games.  The book is about creative applications of ZBrush and assumes the reader has a basic knowledge of the software.  The author recommends Eric Keller's book entitled Introducing ZBush, third edition, for a more foundational introduction to the tools."
2096,1,"It goes without saying that the writings of a \\""maverick\\"" mathematician trumpeting a new value for pi should be met with the utmost skepticism.  Carrying out such skepticism is easier said than done, as this book is chaotic and convoluted - a difficult read not on the basis of its sophistication, but lack thereof.  It starts with a factual though irrelevant observation of the unitless relationship between circumference and area.  Without warning or any level of scientific basis, it jumps to a series of logarithmic formulae that are poorly defined, not derived in the text, and flat-out incorrect.<br /><br />The rest of the book is filled with arithmetic implementations of this incorrect formula.  (One consequence of this formula is that the ratio of the area of a circle and its outer square depends on the size of the square.  This is simply not true, as the ratio is always pi/4.)  Through this serpentine filler, the author ultimately concludes that pi equals 3.125.<br /><br />A 48-line piece of C++ code using integer arithmetic dividing a quarter circle can constrain the value of pi above 3.125 in fewer than 300 iterations.  It took me less than 35 minutes to write and test this code, not 35 years.<br /><br />This book could be an interesting study in mathematical fallacies if it were possible to follow its labyrinth of steps.  This book's creation, publication and reading were a complete waste of time."
2097,5,"I loved it! I had been following the blog of author and was so excited when the book became available.  The author shares her journey as she navigates through the grief of losses - of people, of hopes - by visiting different worship communities.  The book is written in an easily accessible format covering each visit to a worship house in a chapter.  I loved the breath of religious experience spanned and the authors respectful approach to each worship community.  I loved that she stepped out of her comfort zone and took risks.  I loved that she could see the value of a religious tradition for the participants and apply the \\""lesson\\"" to her journey.  I felt encouraged to think broadly about different worship traditions and to perhaps embark on one of my own. I highly recommend the book."
2098,4,"HAVE READ MANY OF THE JOSHUA BOOKS. THEY ARE A BIT PREDICTABLE, BUT I ALWAYS FEEL SO GOOD AFTER READING THEM.I WILL READ ALL OF THE SERIES AT SOME POINT. HAVE LENT OUT ALL OF THE BOOKS I HAVE PURCHASED AND EVERYONE LIKES THEM ALSO."
2099,5,The book is just enough of inspiration and ideas to make you want to keep it nearby for a reference. The color pictures add to the enjoyment of the book!
2100,5,"Belles just flows; it is heart warming and promising - Jen Calonita just kept on giving me more and more, charming me with wonderful memorable characters and amazing scenes!<br /><br />Isabelle Scott, aka Izzie, is trying to keep her little family together ever since her mother passed away when she was ten. She goes to school, teaches swim classes, takes care of her sick grandmother and all the household chores. She does everything and anything in order to keep her social worker happy so she doesn't have to be placed into foster care... but when Izzie's grandmother's Alzheimer's gets worse, the social worker has no choice but to do what is right and place grandma in a home and reveals that Izzie is going to go live with her long lost Uncle at a nearby town, Emerald Cove.<br />In one night, Izzie's life is turned upside down. She is taken away from her homely town on the boardwalk and thrust into a gated community, private school, thousand dollar dresses and 'mean girls'.<br />But Izzie is so well grounded, she knows how to handle herself and does it so well.<br /><br />Izzie's cousin, Mirabelle, was a bit hard to like in the beginning. As a true southern belle, Mira put on her smile and did her best to just go through the niceties in welcoming Izzie. And of course, we all saw through that. But as the story went along, we see changes in Mira, and hope for the best.<br /><br />More drama and secrets unfold - you couldn't ask for more!<br /><br />I really enjoyed how Calonita would smoothly alternate between Izzie and Mira's thoughts. I got to see and hear both sides of their stories. I also love and appreciate how Calonita ended the book. Pure perfection and I cannot wait to read Belles sequel, Winter White, being released on October 9th, 2012.<br /><br />*I recieved a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review."
2101,2,"The book is too tighted up with the TV show from BBC. So if you haven't seen the tv show, or don't know what I'm talking about, this book is a waste of time. It won't go deep dive into spy craft. There are other books that excel at that."

2105,3,"I love Nora Roberts and am always thrilled to see a new paperback appear for sale.  That said, this book (much like The Search) just doesn't reach the level of her earlier books.  Despite being longer than many previous offerings, the story here seems to take a backseat to the technical details of firefighting- interesting in small doses, it became a bit overwhelming as presented.  I love Roberts for her characters and the relationships she crafts for them, not for their careers or how well researched her books undoubtedly are, so this book for me was a bit of a bust.  Truthfully, even a bad Nora Roberts is better than the best some romance writers have to offer but I hold Roberts to a higher standard based on the quality of the body of work.<br /><br />If you do have an interest in firefighting, I suspect this book will be a 4 or even 5 star read, but if you are looking for a deeply satisfying relationship story, then this books sadly isn't it."

2107,5,"Like many of you here today, I had to buy this book for a college psychology class, introductory level.  It served its purpose well by covering a wide variety of topics.  The brain, human development, learning, memory, personality, motivation, emotions, psychological disorders, therapy, social psychology...  The book gives an overview of just about everything a newbie needs to know.<br /><br />I wouldn't go so far as to call it a fun read--it is a textbook after all--but never did it feel painful.  The text has pinches of humor in it, pictures to illustrate the main points, and some comics to go along with the reading.  Not to mention a lot of it is pretty interesting, applicable to everyday life.  It makes its points clearly, not relying on heavy jargon, yet doesn't talk down to readers either.<br /><br />At times, it gives so many examples of research to back up its point that it's easy to get lost in very specific statistics.  Just focus on the main point the statistics and findings are supporting.  Also, sections discussing the biology of the brain can get very confusing--something relatively unavoidable.  As a whole, though, the text is a relatively smooth read.  Plus, the margins are nice and large, allowing students to take plenty of notes.<br /><br />However, I don't think you have to be in school to get something out of this textbook.  I, for one, am a writer and editor who does not specialize in psychology at all, but I've already consulted this book on a few occasions.  It provides solid research to back up claims that are relevant to our lives.  For instance, is violent media linked to actual violent behavior?  Is \\""letting your anger out\\"" better than holding it in?  How does war affect our soldiers?  Are job interviews accurate?  What logical fallacies do you often find lurking in the news and everyday conversation?  How effective is therapy?  This text addresses these issues and many, many more.  In many cases, it refutes common assumptions people make.  It also acknowledges situations in which there is disagreement over a certain point, but without forcing anything on the reader.<br /><br />If you need a broad overview of psychology for any reason, I can recommend this book.  And even if you think you only need it for school, I'd recommend keeping it afterwards.  Besides, if you like wowing people with random knowledge, there's all sorts of interesting trivia in here.  Overall, this is one of the best textbooks I got during my undergraduate years, and I'm sure it can be of use in many different situations.It also acknowledges situations in which there is disagreement over a certain point, but without forcing anything on the reader.<br /><br />If you need a broad overview of psychology for any reason, I can recommend this book.

2109,4,"In this book, Randi explains how easy it is to make people believe things they should know better than to believe; how easy it is to dupe people.  And leave them wanting more!  Knowing that these varied kinds of Faith Healers have endangered and at times cost lives, he is attempting to give a \\""wake-up call\\"" to those who are in the throes of such people, and to public officials whose job it is to be aware of fraud.

2111,4,This is what I hoped it would be from reading his other books.  You have to like the subject matter.  The history. The Cold War. McCarthyism.  It's the character development and interaction that kept me reading.  The dialog goes on and on but I didn't get tired of it because it made the characters real. Kanon has a unique style that really grew on me. It helped that I liked the characters too.  I even became sympathetic to the supposed traitor.  I look forward to his next book.

I wasn't sure I wanted to read it because it was supposed to involve a correspondence between the hero & heroine for much of the story, which meant they'd be apart a good while (a no-no in a romance). But the author made up for this by having such a good development to their friendship/relationship in the first third of the book. One of Sundin's strengths is excellent dialogue between the hero and heroine. Their wit was so catching, you could just feel the growing chemistry between two shy people. When they were apart, there was such interesting stuff going on and good interactions among the secondary characters, which made up for the separation of the two main characters. The World War II details, especially about flying, were so well done and authentic-sounding. There were quite a few laugh-out-loud moments for me, and one tear jerking one (reading Walt's grandfather's letter to him). I look forward to reading the other two books in this series."
2114,5,"Douglas has a gift, or genius of communication.  He can relay information to horse and human with explicitly and simplicity.<br /><br />In his book, \\""The Seven Deadly Sins of Dressage\\"", he explains in detail human nature through their sins, the nature of a horse and how man must understand his sins in order communicate with the horse and to effectively train him. With Douglas's experience of over 20 years in the training of dressage, his explanation of the \\""Sins of Man\\"" are what interfere with the training of the horse, or man learning how to ride well.  Riding dressage is the highest expression of horse training, so the faults of man must be overcome to master both the concept of riding dressage and with the training of the horse.<br /><br />I consider, \\""The Seven Deadly Sins of Dressage\\"", a horsemanship Bible of sorts or a \\""Good Book\\"".  Because dressage demands so much of horse and rider, the book is a guide to how to achieve this level of riding and training.<br /><br />\\""The Seven Deadly Sins of Dressage\\"", also carries the signature of a musician in Douglas's style of writing.  I see lyrics and prose evident in this book's content reflecting Douglas's musical nature and love of music.<br /><br />All who are interested in the study of dressage or any other discipline of riding should read this book. No matter what your age, anyone interested in riding or training will glean much knowledge from this master dressage instructor, Douglas Puterbaugh."
2115,5,"I found valley fever epidemic to be very well written and presented. It is the only book of it's type. The book gives an indepth explanation of the disease, it's history as it's known, symptoms, treatments, what to expect and what questions to ask a medical Dr if you or someone in your family has it.<br />Includes all medical citations & references. It is well researched and documented for layman and medical profession.<br />This book has been a lifesaver for me. I have purchased copies for my family and drs."
2116,4,"In the novel, Star Wars: The Old Republic - Revan, there are three points of views. The first point of view is from Revan;  Revan is a Jedi that disobeyed the Jedi council, and fought the Mandalorians to the unknown regions with his apprentice,  Malak, and followers. When they returned they fell to the dark side and started a war with the Republic. A Jedi strike crew attacked Revan's ship at which point Malak turned on Revan and fired on his ship to take the title of Dark Lord.  Bastila, who was part of the strike crew, brought Revan to the Jedi Counsel where they saved him from dying and he turned back to the light and helped them stop Malak. After Malak attacked him, he lost his memory. Now he's starting to gain it back and  he remembers that there was something dark in the unknown regions that threatened to destroy the Republic. The second point of view is from Lord Scourge who is a pure-blood Sith Warrior who is asked by the emperor to investigate assassination attempts on Nyriss. The last point of view is from Meetra who is a Jedi that followed Revan in the Mandalorian war. After the war she disappeared and returns to stop the fallen Jedi who were killing other Jedi. After she defeats the fallen Jedi, she goes in search of Revan. The book takes place on 4 different planets;  Corascant, Rekkiad, Nathema and Dromund Kaas. The protangonist in this book is the Sith Emperor.<br /><br /> Revan thinks the darkness that he remembers may have something to do with the Mandalorians declaring war on the Republic. In order to find out more, he must help his friend, Canderos , and Clan Ordo find Mandalor's mask so they can declare a new Mandalor. He finds the mask along with a datacron which holds coordinates to a Sith Planet and he leaves for the planet with T3-M4.  Lord Scourge starts to investigate local human separatist groups to find Nyriss's assailant. He finds and kills the assailant but realizes Nyriss is hiding something. She reveals  that she and dark counsel members are plotting to kill the Emperor. To get Lord Scourge to join her and the dark counsel members, Nyriss takes him to the Emperor's home planet where the Emperor has consumed all life on the planet to fuel his power. After seeing the atrocity that was committed, Lord Scourge joins forces with her. As they are leaving, Revan arrives on this planet and they capture him. Revan tries to convince Lord Scourge to join with him. Meetra returns to the Republic's base. After defeating the fallen Jedi there, T3-M4  reveal to her what happened to Revan. She then sets out for Natema where she finds coordinates to Dromund Kaas. She leaves for Dromund Kaas. She meets with Lord Scourge.  After talking to her, he decides to team up with her and Revan. They devise a plan to free Revan with a distraction using the Emperor and his fear.  After they free Revan, they attack the Emperor.<br /><br /> This book is geared toward the fans of the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic video games. It is a good book for this particular group of fans. The book interlocks the two series of games by combining the characters of both video games. It reveals the Sith Emperor's life. If you are not a fan of  the video games or if you have never played these games, you may not like this book as much. This book is full of action and suspense.  The ending leaves you wanting another book in the series. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read and likes Star Wars: The Old Republic games."
2117,5,"this book is amazing easy read, I related to the locations, the family issues, and restaurant aspect,<br />This is a restaurant 101 of how a restaurant is run, 98% was concise and to the point the other 2% of the travels through the vineyards seemed a little blow hard and wasn't nescessary to respect his view on wine but when your writing a book this was ego a boost chapter.<br />better than every other restaurant book that I have read, and I have read numerous books, I own and run 2 restaurants. I appreciate after 25 years in the business if I can learn one thing, in this book I learned numerous Items some as simple a reminder for the table tap to make a customer feel good, and also a reminder if its not successful sell move on and be more successful in another concept or location."
2118,2,"In an era when the scientific evidence shows all traits arise as a combination of nature and nurture, Jesse Prinz sees a need for a thorough and rather one-eyed defence of nurture's primacy over nature. He introduces ideas well and discusses a heap of fascinating studies, but this book is a missed opportunity to take us beyond hoary old dichotomies."
2119,2,"This could have been a great book due to the strong subject matter but the author never captured the essence of a true love story or a true tragedy.  I never felt the compelling head over heels in love, found my soul mate, eternal type of love that epitomizes that one great love in the Kathy and Richard characters.  The author penned a tale of more rebellious rejects than love struck misfits.<br /><br />The story felt forced and the attempt to build great supporting characters fell short. The tragedies failed to captured the depth of emotion and anguish that one would expect and left me feeling cheated as a reader.  The ending of the book was as big of a disappointment as the rest of the book.  Save your reading hours for something else from a different author.<br /><br />This is the second book by Anne L Watson that has left me feeling this way so I now know not to read anything else written by her."
2120,5,What a touching and inspiring book for young and old alike!  Every house needs this book in their home library.  The illustrations are lovely and the message is affective and meaningful.
2121,5,"Susan does it again for her readers,,,she keeps us up all night this book Summer Days takes us back to Fools Gold, Calif for more romance. This book is one that once you read it you will not stop talking about it to others especially if you are a Californian or former Californian like myself. You feel so good after you have read it and can't wait till the next ones Summer Nights and All Summer Long come out.So have a good summer and remember to throw a Susan Mallery book in your purse."
2122,5,"I had the beautiful opportunity to read this work of art while vacationing in Barcelona - I don't know which I loved more, the city or the book. Together they will forever be intertwined and cherished in my memory. I'm very thankful for the experience - althought to clarify, I'd recommend this invigorating,ferocious read to anyone - anytime and any place!"
2123,5,"Wow! A Giant Is Born is very informative in teaching us about the Giant Saguaro and other cacti in the Arizona desert. The photos are very vibrant. I love how the author tells the story as if she were the Giant Saguaro, keeping the attention of young readers."
2124,5,"I'm about halfway through the book and I really like it, and not all the stories are a million pages long so I can easily read a story in one sitting in bed before my eyelids get too heavy. The stories are pretty diverse too. Not every single story makes me feel hot and bothered, but at least there's a little something for everyone in this collection."
2125,5,A great book that is for newly weds and couples who have been married for a long time.  It is hard for marriages to last a lifetime without including the Lord in your marriage.
2126,5,"Excellent resource. Better to purchase this from Fabricators & Manufacturers Association, International. Just google the site. Price is $62 for non-members."
2127,1,"I recently took the Praxis 2 5015 and I left the test ready to bang my head into a wall. This was the only guide I used to prepare for the test and I feel that it was not helpful at all. The study guide practice questions and the content related to each section seem to focus on specific questions about content - but the test itself had ZERO questions about content. The test was more about applications and teaching methodology - none of which was put into the study guide. Also, there were sections that I wasted time on such as physical education, that weren't even in the exam. The majority of the test (approx 35%) is language arts, about 25% is math, and the rest was a mix of social studies and who-knows-what. Do not waste your money on this study guide."
2128,5,"The late Steven Bach, whose own life is worthy of a biography, offers here a scintillating and thoroughly engrossing account of the career of Moss Hart, playwright, director, producer, screenwriter, play doctor, and actor. Hart's wife, the late Kitty Carlisle, did not cooperate in its writing, possibly because she was reluctant to discuss Hart's sexual ambiguity, although the subject is treated with sensitivity by an author who was himself gay. I haven't read Jared Brown's more recent bio of Hart (for which Carlisle did cooperate), so I can't compare the books as other reviewers have done, but I can definitely note that this book is worth reading for those fascinated by Broadway theatre of the mid-century, as well as by the Hollywood of those days. As others have noted, the account of the making of My Fair Lady is outstanding, but I can't understand why Bach makes no reference, in his text or bibliography, to Keith Garebian's book, \\""The Making of My Fair Lady,\\"" which sometimes differs from Bach's account. Nevertheless, Moss Hart's remarkable career is wonderfully recounted by Bach, from his poverty-stricken childhood as the son of poor Jewish immigrants from England (who had rather distinguished relatives) growing up mainly in the shabbier part of New York's Upper East Side, to his dropping out of school at 14 and his slowly building a life in the theatre that included the co-creation of two of the era's most popular plays (You Can't Take it with You and The Man Who Came to Dinner) and the scripts for movie classics like Gentlemen's Agreement and the Judy Garland version of A Star Is Born, not to mention the direction of My Fair Lady and Camelot."
2129,5,"I am going to raise $5,000,000 dollars for a business I'm building. I am specifically using the Napoleon Hill plan to get it.<br />I highly recommend this particular book. This is the Rolls Royce of the Rolls Royce of success books. I own this version. I have given several as gifts.<br />\\""The Secret\\"", \\""Neuro-Linguistic Programming\\"" etc... were all stolen from this book. Why? because they work! I have seen enough evidence to know that there is literally gold in these pages! (you have to be willing to do EXACTLY as it says).<br />Napoleon Hill didn't make up these ideas- he got them from interviewing many very successful men. He just distilled the basics of what got them to their lofty heights. I have seen people use this plan. I have seen them do extremely well. I know it works, and I know it will work for me.<br />Think and Grow Rich is a very meaty book. Every single page contains vital information. This book IS a workbook in it's entirety. I use the original book as a workbook. I use red and blue pens to underline important information. I put stars next to particularly vital information. I put circles next to passages that contain specific actions. I use my computer to customize his program into mine, and to print out things that need to be. I re-read the book regularly. I am putting this book into ACTION.<br />Do yourself a favor and get this particular version book (not an amended or updated version either!) Get the leather bound deluxe version... and PUT IT TO WORK! MAKE YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE!"
2130,1,"I received this as a gift. Full of dumb hocus-pocus, no real substance, and no index. Not that the ideas are bad, but the executions are overly dramatic. And remember, the only spells that work are those you write yourself."
2131,4,This is the first book I've read that placed such an emphasis on music keeping the world going. It's well written and is peopled with interesting characters. I had a hard time putting it down each night and eagerly await its sequel.
2132,5,"My Attorney husband bugged me about buying this book for weeks. I finally did, for a really great price, and he literally didn't put it down until he was through. Of course, now we have regular political conversations about it. I would say it isn't for everyone, but if you have political interests you will find it an easy read and a real eye opener."
2133,5,"I won this book through goodread's giveaway and so thankful that I did. This little novel surprised me; Jason Warne did a fantastic job. The story was interesting and kept me turning the pages. Fix by Force is a story we can all relate to in one way or the other. Kids are cruel, life is cruel for that matter. Jason tells a sad, and very realistic story of a boy bullied at school and at home. The plot of the book is how the boy deals and copes with life as a teenager where the cards are stacked against him. Unfortunately, he turns to steroids to try and \\""fix\\"" himself. I felt for the characters, and found myself emotionally investing in them. There are important messages in the pages of Fix by Force and every teenager boy should read this.<br /><br />I will be waiting to see what is next from Jason Warne."
2134,5,I am not a big reader but I very much enjoyed this book.  It has great infomration on marketting and the new age of marketing with social media and other technology.  I have a hard time staying interested in books but I was able to stay interested.  I sometimes found myself not wanting to put the book down.  You will definitly enjoy this boook if you are a marketing professional or a marketing student.
2135,5,"From the vein of such stories as The Freedom Writers Story comes a compelling novel that documents the struggles of a teacher and her class as they transformed from a dysfunctional bunch that failed to get along at every turn to a unified group focused on putting on a successful and original production of a class play. As cruel and misguided as disaffected children can be, all it takes is a dedicated mentor to let them know that they are able to function on a level that has somewhere along the lines been abandoned. Considering all of the violence in schools that we're always hearing about, this teacher's approach to nurturing a safe, healthy setting for students is a great guide to faculty that don't know how to fix such problems as bullying and exclusion that students sometimes participate in. While the story only offers the teacher's perspective, it is great in that it is very intuitive of all of the aspects of the journey. She talks about taking time from her lesson plans to conduct her moral instruction, and she explains many incidents from a class that everyone anticipated trouble from. But she couldn't do it on her own, which shows that if children are nurtured properly, there are many problems that schools can more adequately take on.<br /><br />This book also shows how important it is for schools to pay attention to more than academics. Children need many levels of structure and guidance before they are all able to function fairly and efficiently. Of course, the importance of these lessons are subjective, and will vary by region, and may even establish inconsistent notions of morality and uniformity because they vary... In short, teaching and implementing manners is hard, but Greeley's book is an example of the great things that can happen when it is done well."
2136,4,"Put a group of characters together who absolutely hate each other and then tell them to go get something; You end up with a hilarious comedy of characters who want to kill each other but know that they need each other to succeed. Especially when they know failure means angering their benevolent dark lord.<br />The humor is sarcastic, dark and surprisingly witty, an excellent read for those with a pragmatic outlook and a desire to see how the other side of fantasy lives."
2137,3,"I couldn't figure out what nagged at me about this book, but then it hit me: it's the Serengeti. Of course, we have \\""Curious George\\"", the George and Martha hippo series of books by James Marshall, and a plethora of other fine books peopled with anthropomorphic, wild animals (not to mention Aesop's Fables); yet with these books it is fairly easy to suspend disbelief.<br /><br />Not so much with \\""Jungle Bullies\\"". Not for me, at least, and I am a librarian, special ed teacher, and father to a one-and-a-half-year old baby girl. First of all, these animals' characters are neither well-defined nor well-developed, the animals refrain -- with the exception of the monkey and his mother at the end (though if a smaller, weaker animal was available, I am confident the monkey would've aped the bullying behavior of the animals that preceded him and kicked it in the teeth as well) -- similar bullying mantra in the beginning and enlightened mantra at the end, and the story is essentially a parable and a lesson unsubtly disguised as a children's book. Besides, these animals are prey and predators in the wild, so the (thin) narrative loses credence against the backdrop of all the National Geographic and Discovery Channel media that emphasizes that distinction.<br /><br />Now, I don't think there's anything wrong with lessons and parables. Who couldn't use an interesting, entertaining, and illustrative lesson to edify the struggles we daily face in the living of our lives? Including children? Still, I think you lose the audience when you start out with a lesson you want to preach and then hammer out a book around it sans an artistic impulse. That is never a good formula, in my opinion. The Berenstain Bears, every children's book by Wayne Dyer, most of Deepak Choprah's drivel directed at the younger audiences, as well the whole gaggle of celebrity-authored cockamamie effluvium are all prime examples of that insipid instinct to create sermonizing pseudo-literature.<br /><br />While \\""Jungle Bullies\\"" is not so egregious an offender, it does follow down that slippery slope.<br /><br />Clearly, I am not so crazy about the book, although I am not as deeply offended as I am by the other books I mentioned above. Nice illustrations, though."
2138,5,"I purchased this book in San Antonio directly from the author, and I found it to be an excellent read.  This book kept my attention and made me not want to put it down.  I liked how it demonstrated what living within the will of God will do for your life. I can't wait to go back and purchase the author's previous two books."
2139,5,"I always recommend this book to people who want a survey of everything Jewish - the Torah, religious practice post-Biblical era, holidays, history, people.. you name it, it's in here. The book is well organized and has hundreds of short, to the point chapters that keep you engaged and interested despite the length of the book itself.<br /><br />A great guide for anyone interested in Judaism 101."
2140,3,"The plot grips at the start, but it is so preposterous and transparent that it palls at least 100 pages before the end.  I agree with those who say it would be better at half the length; I think the others are pleased with the Victorian period detail, but I found it tedious and sometimes inaccurate both in the matter and the manner.  I think men did not commonly go bearded before the Crimean War, while no Etonian would be seen dead uttering a solecism like 'it was him'; my dictionary gives 1895 for the first use of 'intrigue' meaning 'interest' a similar date for 'paternalistic', and its own date, 1975, has nothing for 'relationship' meaning friendship or love affair.<br /><br />I also found it hard to feel either sympathy or empathy for Glyver: murdering an innocent stranger cuts off the former, and his own stupidity removes the latter.  In this democratic age, who cases who is the heir to Lord Tansor?<br /><br />I suspect it is true of Michael Cox as of Stephen Hawking and Alexander Solzhenitsyn: their works have acquired extra value from the difficult circumstances in which they were produced."
2141,5,very informative and easy to read....great book to have for any dog lover.From all aspects of raising a puppy this book covers indepth topics and areas that I would not have thought of prior to reading.
2142,5,Everyone who loves flowers should have one of these as a reference.  It has every flower imaginable.  A really great book.
2143,5,"I hadn't heard of this author, but was looking for something new to hold my interest on a long flight.  The price was right (kindle version) so I said what the heck. I was pleasantly surprised with this great read.  You feel the emotions experienced by Frank, the main character, throughout the story.  It holds your attention from the first paragraph to the last.  Anyone who was raised in a traditional Italian family will immediately relate to the honor, loyalty and intrigue imbedded in the storyline. Makes me wonder how much of the suppposedly fictitious tale really is founded in fact...<br /><br />One question: Will there be a sequel? If so, when?"
