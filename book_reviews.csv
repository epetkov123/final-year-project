0,5,This became one of my grandson's favorite books.
1,5,Good thought provoking piece!!
2,5,"This is the &#34;everything you ever wanted to know about Sean Connery&#34; book! Wow! It was full of all the tiny details about his life that true fans and admirers itch to know, in getting to understand the man behind the James Bond magic. I really loved learning about how he remains so true to his original artistic convictions and strong in the face of ever-more meddlesome papparazi and press wanting to impose on his personal space. He is really a model for up and comers in show biz looking to make their artistic mark and unique vision in an often all-too noisy industry."
3,5,"Nice book, I gave it to my son and loved it."
4,5,"This was my favorite Toothfairy book as a child. I bought it for my son just before he lost his first tooth. He made me read it twice a day for more than a week, so it's 5yr old boy approved!"
5,4,Bainton not discusses not only Luther himself but also the conditions and beliefs of the times.
6,5,"I love all of Nicole Wilde's books.  Very informative, well written, easy to understand, great addition to any dog trainer's collection."
7,5,Excellent reading for everyone especially Filipinos all over the world.  Lots of the book contents are unknown to most.  A very educational and informative documentary in the history of the Philippines.
8,5,Until now there has not been a book to cross my desk that I could recommend to a woman who wanted to understand why her man is the way he is when it comes to wiring. We men have a problem talking about it and this book will be a great help in this area.<br />Men want to be understood just as much as women. But since men seem to have bought the John Wayne silent persona we find it difficult.<br />Along with Craig Gross to provide the male grounding Feldhahn explains for the woman the wiring that makes the male different. This is meant to be used as a discussion guide.
9,5,"Enjoyed, great pictures"
10,5,cat is all good
11,5,"Excellent item, thanks."
12,5,Could not put this book down! Loved the cast of characters. An imaginative collection of short stories and something for everyone.
13,5,"This is a well written and entertaining novel about Li Du, an exiled scholar in 18th c. China. Traveling in the Yunnan Province, regarded as the wild borderland of the empire at that time, he learns that the Emperor is soon paying a visit to impress the people by &#34;commanding the heavens&#34; -- bringing about a solar eclipse. When a visiting scholar is murdered, Li Du is assigned to find the killer before the Emperor arrives.<br /><br />A decent mystery serves as the backdrop for a narrative that gives a lot of information about China of that time, when Jesuits served as advisors to the Emperor, and the Dutch East India Company was struggling to develop markets and trade in the empire.<br /><br />The characters are interesting and the dialogue is natural, but the best aspect of this novel is the elegant descriptions that convey a kingdom far away in place and time."
14,5,"If you enjoy retro cartoon design and color, this book is a jewel you have to discover!  I have apreciated derek yaniger's art, what little I had seen, and I saw this book and the few pics on amazon intrigued me, and the reasonable price didn't hurt either.  WOW! I was in heaven, drinking-in the illustrations and colors. I am an artist and I enjoy and find inspiration in this book, and although I was not looking for a book on drinks, I found that I did enjoy finding out about them aswell.  Now I'm thirsty"
15,5,Erotica with real character development - seriously. This naughty little gem is half erotic romance and half chicklit or women's fiction. The absolute perfect indulgence for any woman. I snuggled up with this one and read it through the night.
16,3,"6 yr old not overly interested - she loves to read, loved &#34;The Eights&#34; series, looking for something comparable, something with action and humor while maintaining enough suspense to carry over to the next evening.  We have been reading via telephone at bedtime as sher lives in MA and I live in MD"
17,5,Great book!
18,5,Well written and narrated. Amazing story. Highly recommend.
19,5,"The artistry of these cards is impeccable. I have never purchased Tarot cards before but am so happy I chose these. There is definitely more of a feminine quality to them but that is probably clear from the cover. The companion booklet is well written, thought provoking and mindful.  Quite delighted."
20,5,Very good.  Allot of information and opinions.  Must read for the person interested in a new beginning.
21,2,Same story over and over again and not as funny anymore.
22,5,Clear and concise with strategies easy to implement.
23,1,Stories boring and I could not get into any of them.  Never finished any.
24,5,"Best diabetes book I have read in 15 years as a diabetic!  I have read all the popular books, and all of the highly rated books here, as well as others. Like many diabetics, I never stop searching for the best approach to this disease. What I like most about this book is that it prescribes an exercise program, step by step, and gives you all of the details that you need to follow through. No other diabetes book that I have read so far does that. As a see a dietitian for my diet, I passed on the diet portion of the book, but began the exercise program. It has been extremely helpful!  I have already broken through a weight plateau that I was stuck at for months!  I enjoy other benefits of the exercise besides weight loss - ability to lower my insulin dose, a feeling of invigoration, better body tone, and better sleep. Exercise is good for everyone, but for us diabetics it is essential."
25,5,Excellent job! Exactly as described. Nicely packaged!
26,5,"This well written novel introduces several female characters, and the author does a great job of helping readers keep them straight!  (no pun intended!)  Maggie Rae-McInnis and her partner of twelve years, Addison, own a large, beautiful home in the Hollywood Hills.  With three stories, the home is large enough to rent out rooms to other women.  Tess, who's partner died in a car crash, Dusty, who enjoys playing the field, and Eve, who is trying to figure out her own identity are the current three renters.  Tess and Dusty are long-term tenants, and are close friends of Addison and Maggie.  Also playing an important role in this plot is Rebecca, who is a wise woman/seer and gives the different characters insight into what is going on in their lives.<br />With a length of over three hundred pages, there is plenty of time to enjoy these well developed characters, and to enjoy the author's warm humor."
27,5,Thanks
28,1,Was bought for a coworker who likes it.
29,2,This book is not very good. Most people have the basic knowledge about coconut oil that is covered in this book. You can get the information on the internet for free - just google benefits of coconut oil.
30,5,Love this book! So informative and covers a lot of Celtic history. Very well written. One of the best books I've ever read!
31,4,good
32,5,who thought all this would happen to the Rabbit's??  I love Roddy Doyle!
33,5,Very funny
34,4,"Got it for college. I wouldn't read it if it was for a class, but it isn't terrible."
35,5,"A delightful book, filled with historical detail and wonderful characters. Samantha's writing was both beautiful and poetic. I particularly liked the way she unravelled the story of the characters leading up to the hurricane. A real page-turner."
36,5,I love this book!!!! It was just what I needed! It helped both calm and inspire me through difficult times.
37,5,"What a wonderful story! As owners of a Wire Fox Terrier and parents of twin boys, we just adored this story. Our kids laugh each time we read it as they love to hear about all of the mischief and fun that Rumplepimple gets into. As a parent, I love the entire concept of the book and how it is written. It is a family favorite! Keep up the great work - we can't wait to see whats next!"
38,4,"This novel tells an interesting story of love, destiny, and strength.  I really enjoyed the multiple characters of different species and how they interacted throughout the novel.  The descriptions of each scene and character were vivid and helped the reader get into the story.  Definitely a quick, fun read....  I am ready for Volume 2."
39,5,This is a great book for young patriots!  The binding was stated as &#34;unknown&#34;; it was a soft-cover.  I bought a hard-cover when my children were small.  I wanted an extra copy for my classroom.  This will be perfect.
40,4,"Vanessa Munroe's lover has been sent to Japan to infiltrate a company that has gotten wind of some industrial espionage.  She comes to visit him while healing from wounds from a prior escapade.  He gets hauled off by the authorities and she spends the remainder of the novel investigating the situation and trying to spring him out. The action is on speed dial warp 10 and the pages turn themselves.  You quickly learn to trust no one.  She does without sleep or food to accomplish her mission.  If someone is looking for a strong female heroine, try this one.  My thanks to the author and the Penguin First to Read program for a complimentary copy."
41,5,My son is entering second grade and loves these books. Great series with a bit of history in each book. You do not need to read I survived books in order. All are  wonderful.
42,5,"A fantastic atlas. Plenty of detail for planning trips and Sunday drives. I purchased this size after looking at all of them in a bookstore, and it certainly has everything I need."
43,5,Good read
44,5,Bought this as a gift for my husband. He loved it!!! Fast shipping too and in perfect condition :)
45,3,Buyer beware: condensed and simplified versions of each tune
46,5,I enjoy all of this author's books.
47,5,"Overall, I've had good luck with the recipes in this book. They are pretty simple, plain, down-to-earth recipes that, as the title indicates, don't need a lot of ingredients and taste like the stuff Mom and Grandma make. Good country cooking, just as you can expect from Taste of Home.<br /><br />This would be a good book for a beginner cook. It has nice full color pictures and easy to follow instructions. It contains everything from breakfast recipes, to main courses, to side dishes to desserts. My only quibble is that it can be hard to make the book lay flat when you are following a recipe, but that's often the problem with perfect-bound cookbooks.<br /><br />So far, favorite recipe is the &#34;brownies&#34; made with graham cracker crumbs.  So easy and so yummy.  Kids just mowed right through em."
48,5,A wonderful book written by  an exceptional woman. A must read.
49,5,Reading this as it is a classic i have never read. its a great story and the characters are so rich
50,5,I really love the story about the fish. When Maxx is worried about the worm ... we cracked up!
51,5,"Great book and gift, my dad was stationed there in WWII!"
52,4,"I wanted to read a famous writer's enduring classic, but I must admit the movie with Spencer Tracy and Freddie Bartholomew spoiled me for the reading.;  Sometimes it's better not to see the movie first."
53,5,Awesome! The ideas presented in this book are amazing! If we could all begin to think about &#34;waste&#34; in this way it would be great.  There was  just the right amount of science and art.
54,5,excellent
55,5,"I bought this book thinking it would be a good way to explain to my kids what I do at the office all day while they're at school - perhaps a light-hearted, feel-good tale with cute pictures that would make my kids happy.<br /><br />Instead, I got a book about a mean drunk whose so-called &#34;friends&#34; stage an unwelcome intervention, who then sees fit to drag his kids to AA meetings (which he attends only reluctantly) where he tells them to be quiet and color on the floor! What kind of reprobate forces his kids to go to AA meetings with them? Well, as my friend says, &#34;alcoholics go to meetings, drunks go to bars.&#34;"
56,5,This book is such a good idea and fills such an important need and it is very well done.  I wish a new writer could be authorized to update it.
57,5,Lots of very good pictures and information.
58,2,"This story has an interesting plot and it plays out differently than your run of the mill &#34;only person alive here&#34; story, but as many other reviewers have mentioned it is overly technical and not well written. You don't have to read deeply to follow the plot, you can skim through the boring log entries. That helped me to get through it. But, you might want to skip the book and watch the movie instead. Just don't expect the movie to be great either or you will probably be disappointed. I don't think that Matt Damon will make a good Mark Watney. Mike Birbiglia would have been a better choice. I'm not a Birbiglia fan girl, but I think he and Mark have a similar sense of humor."
59,5,This book is wonderful will definetly make u think!!! Excellent read
60,5,I love this bible. The look and feel and the size of the writing. I was excited when I got it.
61,5,Perfect summer read with solid character development. Lots of laughs!
62,5,LOVE IT
63,5,Meets expectations
64,5,"there are still a few i need, but i am almost there. i have seen every show more thean once. i am a hardcore fan, lol. of hers and the show!<br /><br />doc and sheriff. more of amis than tupper."
65,5,"so much information, easy to follow"
66,2,Come on-who wants a story where everything and everybody is perfect. Stale characters and predictable outcome. This was the first book by Rosenfelt that I read and I'm not that impressed. Too much telling and not enough showing-this is taught in writing 101. Who cares that Andy watches football all day-does he ignore his dog while he sits on a couch. I will go back and read his first book. BUT-when you scream at a book as you are reading about how lame the prose is-that's not a good sign.
67,4,"for older version, good reference manual with screen captures."
68,5,"The Lord's Mercy is real, and this book is an incredible documentation of that. It spoke to me at several cross-roads in my life and has always reminded me of God's immense love for us. Deep and true, this book is for everyone!"
69,1,"The characters were flat and uninteresting even though Flanagan writes about the horrors of war, particular the brutality of the Japanese during the building of the Thai-Burma railroad. Perhaps it is the author's bleak outlook on life, or that the story is told primarily through the eyes of the shallow Dr. Dorrigo Evans who seems to sleepwalk through life without feelings for anyone, even his beloved Amy, but I never related to this book on an emotional level. If you want to read about the cruelty of war and the triumph of the human spirit, read Lauren Hillenbrand's &#34;Unbroken&#34; instead."
70,5,The best book I have ever read...
71,1,"It was okay.  It was more about her and Joe Espisito's relationship.  I did not care about her relationship, I wanted to read more about Elvis, but it wasn't about that.  I would not purchase it."
72,5,"By Lashawn Koko<br />Dont take my advice, read it for yourself. This book is awesome on so many levels. Its inspiring, entertaining, intriguing and most of all interesting. It'll surely have you eager to get to the next chapter...<br /><br />Excellent job Mr. Richardson"
73,1,"A real disappointment.  Having been a big fan of Tom Clancy since the beginning, I should have reminded myself that this is really a book by someone else (Grant Blackwood), so it wasn't going to be Tom Clancy.  It is an ok book and if published directly by Blackwood with different characters, may have passed as a book.  Nonetheless, the hallmark of Clancy's books were the host of characters that Tom went out of the way to make them three dimensional, and wanting for more as the novels came down the road.  I don't think I have ever read a more one dimensional book as &#34;Under Fire&#34;.  One main character (Jack Ryan Jr), and a few forgettable, misc, characters.  It seemed like one long chapter rather than an engaging novel.  Jack seeming to orchestrate an entire coop in Dagestan, mostly by himself, with little support until near the end seemed rather implausible.  In summary, other than Jack Ryan Jr's character, there was little about the book that would make you think it had anything to do with Tom Clancy's previous books.  Second to that is the almost nonexistent fleshing out of the characters.  Just my two cents, I'm sure everyone will see it shaded by their own experience.  I just couldn't recommend this book to anyone."
74,5,I buy it again surely
75,5,"Cute little book, bought this for my son for Valentine's Day"
76,5,My 6yo loved it!! Read the entire book in one day and restarted from beginning the next day!!
77,5,"excellent, thank you."
78,3,I like the first book of the series.  The second is not that much of a mystery as it is a set up for future books.  Both Ryder and his dogs are back along with Maggie O'Dell.  They are sent to a mudslide that hides many many secrets.  The set up is good but at the end we are left hanging.  There is a lot of back and forth in the book as scenes switch from one character and one location to another.  That allowed the author a lot of hooks for the future books in the series.  If you liked Breaking Creed then you need to continue the series with Silent Creed.  Just don't expect that much from the story line.
79,4,Libro muy divertido y entrenido para niños chicos.
80,5,good instructions and they taste wonderful
81,5,Be sure to read all 3 books
82,5,5 Stars....do I need to say anything else??
83,5,Very quick delivery. Love the book!
84,5,One of the best &#34;children's&#34; stories of all time.  A classic for all ages.
85,1,"I bought this book after reading the back, and without looking for any reviews about it.  Bad choice.  First of all, this author has no command of grammar or punctuation.  I've read third-graders' papers that were better than this, and I'm not exaggerating.  From there it's all downhill.  She uses up quite a lot  of the book tooting her own horn about her abilities, and in fact most of one chapter, which she said contained only client's accounts of angel visitations, has I think 2 angel stories that I think she made up because they are in Her writing style, and the rest of the letters - and there are many- are (supposedly) clients' glowing praise of Ms. Kennerley.  (Again, they sound suspiciously like her own voice).  Her information is contradictory.  For  instance, on one page she says that our spirit guides can be deceased loved ones. Just a few pages later she states that deceased loved ones are Never our spirit guides.  She's got facts about  the hierarchy of angels turned around in a few places, or just plain incorrect.  This book often wanders off the subject of angels, to first rays, crystal skulls and some weird jargon I have never heard of. Shall I go on?  I think you have the idea.  It's like she scratched out a very rough draft and decided that was good enough to publish. If you are interested in reading this book, for heaven's sake (pun intended) buy it used like I did, or just save your money.  I don't know anything about this lady, but if her readings are as scattered, egocentric  and contradictory as this book, I won't be booking an appointment anytime soon."
86,5,GREAT INFOMATION
87,5,"Very Cute Easter Book, Nice and small for Easter basket too."
88,5,"Thank you so much for these great &#34;kid friendly&#34; healthy recipes!  Easy to make and good to eat!  My youngest son loves to help me in the kitchen and he has picked out a few of the recipes to help me prepare!  It is nice for something different...that is easy to make!  We can only eat spinach, kale & fruit smoothies so many days in a row!  Brilliant!!"
89,5,Useful resource. Great service
90,4,excellent projects
91,5,I read the whole thing in one evening and cried at the end. What a lovely story.
92,5,The Secret Six always end up working for most despicable villians and I wouldn't have it any other way.
93,5,"Introducing children to words and engaging them at a very young age creates a solid foundation for reading, writing, and the appreciation to become lifelong learners. Children’s book author, John Priest, has shaped another fabulous reading tool for youngsters.<br /><br />Animal Alphabet Search is a fun, entertaining, and unique piece of literature that allows children the opportunity to associate all the letters of the alphabet with their favourite animals. It is very simple to follow while engaging the visionary sense with exceptional pictures. Readers are also given the chance to sharpen their counting skills by locating the specific letter linked to the animal as they are scattered throughout the colourful illustrations.<br /><br />If you are a parent of a young son or daughter, I highly recommend the hard copy purchase of this book as it will be one they remember for many years."
94,5,Good book
95,2,"I bought this book following a recommendation but I should have listened to my internal voice saying loud at me: &#34;With such a title, it can't be good...&#34;. Should I have listened to it, I would have avoided to spend my money on it and the tedious, unpleasant experience of reading it. It says in the intro that &#34;tantra is [...] not a journey for the faint-hearted, the weak-minded or the emotionally troubled. It presents serious difficulties even to the heroic&#34;. I thought that was a good start but I soon realized that there's little challenge in what is presented here, if there's any content at all, because out of a few questionable hints for thoughts, the book appears without a direction and leads nowhere. It's a collection of modestly written writings, partly fictional and partly in the form of an essay, badly organized and introduced to the reader without a clear logic. I found it non compelling at all and really had the impression that the author had no respect for my time. It actually made me lose interest in tantra. I had to go through all that self-referring new-age stuff that I've already read a million times from other questionable self-help manuals in an Eastern spiritualistic vein: chakras, meditation, PC muscle exercises, eating only brown rice for 10 days consecutively... obviously you are supposed to believe what the author says without any proof or evidence whatsoever - at page 250, for example, he lets the reader know that &#34;some tantrikas can taste with their fingertips. Some can taste with their lingams (penis). [...] Some have developed sensitivity inside their veins and arteries and can detect increasing levels of salts, sugars and oils in their blood when digesting food&#34;. And at page 208 you'll find out about an amazing technique that consists in observing each others' genitals for at least half an hour, and &#34;go deeply into the feelings evoked in the meditation&#34;. Yes, sure, go on, and a big thank you for wasting my time like that... On a final note, typography does matter when it comes to books, and this book is ugly to look at, as if it was edited in Power Point. Looks like it's self published - nothing against it, quite the contrary -, but they could at least make it presentable. The typography reveals a bad taste that pairs well with the vacuity of the content, and does nothing to make it more reader-friendly. Each chapter is structured in a triad, narrative-essay-narrative, sort of, but it took me a while to find this out. The feeling was just that I was going through a tedious disjointed writing."
96,5,"Dr Dunn writes in an academic yet approachable manner, building upon the basics to a successful end. Making soap is not hard, but if you are the sort who wants to know WHY, this will get you there."
97,5,A collection of charming stories which will appeal to  foodies and non-foodies.
98,5,A good book./
99,5,Can I just say AMAZING?!?!  The story was engaging and the artwork flawless!!  HIGHLY recommend to any avid comic book reader.  Valiant is quickly becoming my new go-to company for new comics!
100,4,wish johnny & mat would get together
101,5,Great book. I did the exercises in the book and found them really powerful and I could actually see and feel things in my life getting better. Recommended.
102,5,"Love this book! Beautiful illustrations, and is enjoyable for children and parents to find hidden pictures corresponding with the letter on the page"
103,5,"Sometime in 1892, Edward C. Randall, a prominent Buffalo, New York trial lawyer and businessman, was asked by a friend to accompany him on a visit to Emily S. French, a Rochester woman who, Randall was told, had strange powers and received messages from spirits.  “This was an unexplored world to me,” Randall wrote.  I went, and found there two others, both men of national reputation.  We sat in a dark room for two hours, and heard what purported to be voices, though they were only faint whispers.  We were not at all satisfied, but could not condemn, because we did not understand…We did not then believe that the whispers came from the great beyond, but, mystified, we determined to know what they were.”<br /><br />Over the next 20 years, until Mrs. French’s death in 1912, at age 80, Randall would sit with her more than 700 times. “In my investigations, covering many years, in the room in my own home devoted to such work, thousands of men whom I have known personally have talked with me, using their own tongues,” he wrote. “I have recognized their voices; they have recalled and related countless facts and incidents of their daily life and have proved beyond question their identity.”<br /><br />Randall explained that each voice had individuality. “When new spirits come for the first time and take on the condition of vocalization, there is often a similarity in tone quality, but this soon passes away, as they grow accustomed to using their voices in this way,” he explained. “The voices of those accustomed to speak never change, and are easily recognized.  There is no similarity of thought or words.”  Randall further mentioned that the strength of the voices varies greatly, much as they do in earth life.<br /><br />After satisfying himself that Mrs. French was a genuine medium and that he was hearing from “spirit people,” including his mother and father, Randall turned to asking the spirit people questions about the afterlife.  And that is what this book is mostly about. The reader looking for the evidential type of communication coming through mediums will not find much in this book, unless he or she considers the unlikelihood that such wisdom as set forth in the book did not likely come from this very average woman with no special education or exposure to higher philosophies.  That should serve as evidence of something very strange and mystical.<br /><br />In one communication, the communicating spirit likened the difference between his plane and the earth plane as much like the difference between living on land and living in the sea, pointing out that people on land could move with greater freedom than life that exists in the oceans because the material conditions become higher in vibration as we ascend the scales of motion, or, to look at it from the other end, there is more resistance the lower we descend.  But Randall asked for further clarification and was told: “It is difficult to explain to you who know little of matter, the locations and boundaries of the various planes where we live.  First let me impress upon you the fact that energy, that is, life, cannot express itself except in substance.  The idea that spirit people function without substance and that they and the plane in which they live are unsubstantial, is preposterous and illogical.  The gases that compose water, taken separately, are as substantial as when united.  Why should it be thought impossible, since matter was created, for Nature to create other material than physical, to create spirit material?  There are millions of worlds inhabited by human beings in that space you call the sky.  Don’t for a moment think that yours is the only world, and that God made the universe for you alone.”<br /><br />The spirit went on to say that around and about the globe we call earth are separate, material, concentric belts, zones, or planes,  varying in width and vibratory action, as well as in density, and it is to these zones or planes that planetary life passes at the event we call death.  He added that he knew only the boundaries of the plane in which he existed and did not know any more about the boundaries of the planes beyond him than Randall knew about the spirit planes.  Numerous other spirits referred to the planes or spheres in the afterlife and said that there were seven of them.<br /><br />Another spirit communicated she was on the third sphere and only knew of higher spheres from what teachers from those spheres have told her.  “In the lower sphere, one sees such suffering among those still earth-bound,” she said. “They, too, are busy working out past faults and they are often heavy-hearted.  Generally speaking, the first sphere is the one where restitution must be made, and where the final wrenching away from earth conditions takes place.  The second is one of instruction, a period of study, during which the spirit gains knowledge of self and natural laws.  The third is one of teaching those in the lower spheres, as I have said.  The fourth sphere is one of trial and temptation.  The fifth is truth, where error and falsehood are unknown.  In the sixth, all is harmony.  In the seventh, the spirits reach the plane of exaltations and become one with the great spirit that rules the universe.”<br /><br />The wisdom set forth in this book seems very consistent with other communication purportedly coming from the afterlife and offers much to think about.  It certainly offers much more than that provided by orthodox religion.  The book occupies a special place in my library.s that planetary life passes at the event we call death.

106,4,"At times it seemed this book was more about Ronnie Hawkins and Bob Dylan than it was about the musicians in The Band. Both Hawkins and Dylan were important factors in the group’s formation and popularity, but I finished wanting to know more about the individual Band members.<br />*<br />I guess this can be justified by the actual length of time The Band was together. The classic line-up responsible for the hit songs, albums and film The Last Waltz, was short-lived. Their groupings and re-groupings as The Hawks (backing Hawkins), hooking up with Dylan, retreat from New York City to Woodstock, and developing their Americana back-to-the-roots music is the heart of the story. It was also about their musicianship. It’s made very clear that while other artists in the late 60’s and early 70’s were wind milling, posing and jiving onstage, The Band was more interested in keeping their showmanship on low voltage to concentrate on playing good music.<br />*<br />There were insights on each member, though as mentioned I would’ve liked more. Of particular interest was Levon Helm’s anger toward Robbie Robertson for being cut out of songwriting credits and having the rug pulled out from under The Band’s career when Robertson and film director Martin Scorsese staged The Last Waltz. The all-star concert and hit film marked the end of The Band. According to Helm, the concept was Robertson’s idea as a way to leave the group, even though the other members weren’t ready or agreeable to it.<br />*<br />The remainder of the book concentrated on the members’ solo careers and various attempts at reforming without Robertson, their chief songwriter. Richard Manuel, Rick Danko and Garth Hudson are each  worthy of his own book, or at least an individual chapter in this one. Every song ever recorded by the members seemed to be listed, along with many musicians in The Band’s circle that were major, minor, or unknown except to die-hard fans. Even with some musical knowledge, I found many of the players and circumstances to be somewhat confusing and skimmed over these segments.<br />*<br />In all, this is a decent overview of The Band and their music. It’s not a definitive biography, but worth reading if you’re already a fan.I found many of the players and circumstances to be somewhat confusing and skimmed over these segments.<br />*<br />In all, this is a decent overview of The Band and their music.

107,5,Great read along with the way the book's choose your own style should some great passages along with something a bit more uplifting that made me feel better about having neil as my favorite actor
108,1,"God Help the Child by Toni Morrison is the repetitious story of my skin is too dark, my man left me, and my momma did me wrong (that's why I am so messed up as an adult) story line that has been beat to death and needs to die. The story nor its characters were fully developed.  I had no reason to care for the main character, her mother, or her boyfriend. I didn't learn anything from the story. It left me quite...well void.  The book wasn't even 200 pages so I'm not sure if the story ended or if a part 2 is coming.  This will probably be the shortest book review I have ever written because the book just didn't give me anything to write about.  The story was stereotypical and arid.  Definitely, not one of my favorites."
109,5,"Last year, Tracy Groot gave us a snapshot of life in Civil War Andersonville, Georgia in The Sentinels of Andersonville. Her latest release moves us forward to another conflict, World War II, and one of the bleakest times for the English forces during the war. Maggie Bright starts with a scene in Belgium involving a soldier with shellshock. The injured man is unable to utter anything except quotes by the poet Milton, specifically from Paradise Lost. This becomes a running theme throughout the book as he is escorted to Dunkirk to be evacuated.<br /><br />On the other side of the English Channel is Clare, experiencing independence for the first time as the new owner of a yacht. She lets out rooms on it, and has a very small group of acquaintances. She’s been alone for most of her life, but her circle is expanded after her boat is burgled. Thanks to Maggie Bright, her life will be changed forever.<br /><br />Tracy Groot writes in a certain style that’s difficult to describe. Her characters belong to real life and speak appropriately. Descriptions aren’t that detailed but still pulled me into the story. The evacuation took place before the Battle of Britain, so there’s nothing about the Germans bombing London or the south coast. But there are scenes from history, such as the Westminster Abbey prayer service which was attended by the King and Queen of England. It’s written with a touch of humor that offsets the start horror of war. After all, humor is often what kept the British people going.<br /><br />Although the publisher bills Clare as the main character, this is not just Clare’s story. Nor is it that of the American illustrator, the retired school teacher, the English policeman, or the soldiers trying to escape the oncoming Nazi forces in France. This is the story of Maggie Bright, who did what men demanded of her during a time of great danger. I don’t want to give anything away, but I had a tear in my eye when I read the final few pages and I wouldn’t be surprised if you do too.<br /><br />Thank you to Tyndale House Publishers for my complimentary copy of Maggie Bright, which I received in exchange for my honest review.t be surprised if you do too.<br /><br />Thank you to Tyndale House Publishers for my complimentary copy of Maggie Bright, which I received in exchange for my honest review."
110,5,"This book has been amazing. There is a ton of information in it to help parents that may be having a difficult time with their child. I love that this is a Christ-centered book. It really helps you get right to the root of why your child may be acting the way they are, and steps on how to solve those problems with a plan suited for your family.<br /><br />The book teaches you so much about your child, how you can see change in 40 days and how you can grow together as a family. I highly recommend this book to ALL parents. If you are a parent, I am sure at some point this book will come in handy for you. You will learn a lot from it.  ;)<br /><br />I received this book in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
111,5,Thank you!
112,5,"Think you know the Lionel Atwill story? Think you are familiar with the key performances of this<br /><br />unique actor? Think again! Neil Pettigrew has uncovered a wealth of previously unpublished<br /><br />material detailing Atwill’s life, films and theatrical career which adds immeasurably to the sterling<br /><br />research already published by Greg Mank and others. “The Exquisite Villain” covers Atwill’s early life<br /><br />and stage career in greater detail than ever before, and if you want to know the truth behind those<br /><br />infamous court cases, it is all laid out here. On the other hand, if you’re looking for a straightforward<br /><br />“Films of...” style book, this volume is equally indispensible. Each film has its own chapter covering<br /><br />plot points, cast and production detail, and presents many new nuggets of information. Mr<br /><br />Pettigrew scores highly when noting the finer points of Atwill’s performances, where the actor<br /><br />apparently drew upon his own character and experiences. The book is illustrated throughout with<br /><br />numerous rare stills, stage photos and early advertising material which has not seen the light of day<br /><br />since its original publication. I have no hesitation in recommending “The Exquisite Villain” to every<br /><br />fan of Lionel Atwill and classic horror, anyone interested in Hollywood’s golden era, or any student<br /><br />of 20th Century theatre."
113,5,Great book if you want to learn more about this author and the impact his writing had on our lives.
114,2,This was not for WiiU. only xbox and PS.
115,5,I read this book to my 4 year old daughter and 1 year old son every night. They absolutely love it! This book is wonderfully written and the illustrations are beautiful. I definitely recommend this book!
116,5,"The double authors of Rude Awakenings, a British Theravada Buddhist monk Ajahn Sucitto,  and his samanera assistant, Nick Scott, got to the heights and depths of real pilgrimage--the kind done on foot. Bare feet got them a start, but soon the bad roads, travel through farmed fields, small accidents, and blisters, soon returned them to footwear. Bravo for them. Hence the title. With more reviews on this page, I'll finish by urging people to read their story and enjoy their honesty--not to leave out the warm hospitality of villagers who offered them food and rest."
117,5,I loved this book!  It really teaches every reader on how to change relationships by changing the only thing you have control of ... yourself!  This book should be handed out in college so every student can go out in the world and have all the building blocks to build healthy & fulfilling relationships.
118,5,great book * will probably need more for our Bible Study group
119,4,Order revived earlier than expected. Being using it so far with my son. Pretty straight forward.
120,3,Purchased book for a study group on C.S. Lewis.
121,5,We used this book as curriculum for my son when he was 7 and in first grade. I would read to him and he would draw what I read. Two years later and he is still referencing this book!! It was that great and the information that absorbable.
122,1,So someone writes a book and then says that there is no evidence to collaborate anything he says.  So how can you believe any of it?
123,5,love the book
124,5,"Contains your next puzzle piece in understanding this quantum world we live in. Morphic Resonance is not exactly a fireside book, but necessary reading to understand how we are influenced by our connection to the Field. It was an eye-opener for me and helped me understand how our thoughts come together with other thoughts in the existing fields that are already established, ready for us to connect. Is it in the DNA of the Salmon to swim upstream to spawn or do the Salmon connect with a morphic field for the information? How about the Monarch Butterfly migration or the Swallows returning to Capistrano every year and birds flying south for the winter. Expand your knowledge by reading Sheldrakes book."
125,5,John Gotti Jr beat the corrupt system that we have. Read the online book in one night. Go read the book. You will have a new perspective and reality hit about what code and honor is. Good luck to you JR in your redemption. R.I.P to the King of New York.
126,5,"Amazing boo, love the renting part"
127,5,Very nice book!
128,5,Great book for researching glass. Highly recommend it.
129,4,"Tomorrowland is an entertaining review of things we used to think would never happen.<br />I have to say I really wanted to love this book. It seemed it would mix a bit of philosophy into the science. And it does that. But what it doesn’t do is make good on its promises.<br /><br />For example, the chapter called The Science of Mind Uploading. Sounds great, right? But when I read it, I’m baffled about what we would do with that information we garnered from someone’s brain. They call the method Dream Catchers--to preserve wisdom of the most fantastic brains we have. I don’t believe wisdom is a summary of all we know. It’s a summary of how we use what we know.<br /><br />Interesting book, lots of ideas, but read it for the pleasure of it and not for the concrete outcomes that the chapter titles seem to imply."
130,5,Brilliant.
131,1,"&#34;Dead Book Talking?&#34; That's what this book should be titled.  Full of anecdotes, long stories, clever quotes and references to market gurus, companies going belly up, without much on data analysis, as to on how to find & target these collapsing/rebounding company trends, fundamental, technical or anything else.  Only thing worth mention in the book is the use of GARP analysis investing, which is at best wishy-washy.  If it wasn't in Kindle format, it'd be perfect for a fireplace on a cold night or a doorstop.  If you're looking for entertainment and drawn out stories, then this is for you.  Fund manager?  Really? Only positive aspect about the book is that the proceeds go to charity.  A waste of time, effort & money.  Guess the charities have to suffer.  Read Market Wizards instead."
132,5,Good information is found in this colorful children's book.
133,5,"Arrived quickly, just as described, a great book!"
134,5,"I have been in the financial industry for almost 4 years. I am blessed to have learned about this concept/product just after a year of being in the industry. I have read many books on the concept. I have to say that Alberto has done amazing job writing The private banking system!! Very precise, simple, to the point and most importantly UNDERSTANDABLE. I have started giving this to people who want to learn how banks work and are serious about their financial future. If i could give 10 stars i would!!!!"

136,5,Answered my questions
137,5,Great.
138,5,"Kelly Corde's book was not only entertaining to read but also thoroughly researched. His tone and style of writing captivated me from the first minute. I also appreciated the heavy use of pictures both current and historical. I can fully recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in climbing, mountaineering, adventure or history."
139,3,Gave to husband.

142,4,This  is an easy to follow cookbook with tasty yet healthful ingredients ---
143,5,"&#34;The Feeling of Closing Your Eyes&#34; is a poignant collection of poetry that takes you inside the mind of a person battling with depression. Through the raw and beautifully written poems, I was able to better understand the emotional exhaustion and isolation experienced by those suffering with severe depression. The author is a gifted poet, and her vulnerability is felt throughout the collection. This is a quick read, yet filed with well written, revealing poetry. If you or someone you love is suffering, or if you are professional seeking to gain a deeper understanding of the human condition, please get this book!"
144,5,"I was just reading the other Amazon reviews of this book and I see that I will be in the minority. In general I would normally agree with them on &#34;please leave Austen's work alone.&#34; However, it is rare toa have a writer of this caliber do a remake of someone else's work. Make no mistake, McCall Smith is not a small talent. His 44 Scotland Street books I absolutely devour they are so good. This reminds me also of Tom Holt who did an admirable job of tackling E.F. Benson's Mapp & Lucia, while a student at Oxford no less. He too did a great job. So yes I agree that most &#34;fan fiction&#34; is bad but I am absolutely delighted to discover excellent modern, present day writers reinventing these classics.<br /><br />As to the book itself. There is one character with whom I believe McCall Smith outdoes Austen. This is Emma's father. I cannot think of another author who has so well depicted a hypochondriac and worry wart. As one example: he hires a photographer to put his other daughter in &#34;Country Living Magazine&#34; for the country horsey set to attract a squire like husband. He watches in absolute horror as she takes off on the tattooed photographer's motorcycle, immediately taken with him.<br /><br />This is set present day but still in an English country village. Emma drives a Mini-Cooper. She likes going into the village coffee house to read her email and sip coffee and eat scones. She went to university in Bath to learn design and ultimately wants to design her own textiles for production. But Emma still has the same flaws as in the original. The minute she catches sight of Harriet Smith, she wants to control her destiny and find the ultimate man for her. This is because she thinks she was totally responsible for marrying off Miss Taylor to James Weston. She is increasingly aware of Mr. Knightley but calls him George as people do nowadays.<br /><br />I had to jolt myself now and then to realize the characters were not wearing clothes from the early 1800s but other than that type of thing the transformation was totally convincing.<br /><br />There are five other authors who are doing these reinventions via &#34;The Austen Project.&#34; I was able to find Joanna  Trollope's version of &#34;Sense & Sensibility&#34;. I have not been able to find yet Val McDermid's &#34;Northanger Abbey&#34; or Curtis Sittenfeld's &#34;Pride & Prejudice.&#34; Val McDermid is as much a favorite of mine as McCall Smith so I am eager to read her new take on it.thing the transformation was totally convincing.

146,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed this romance, which had other elements as well, including a possibly psycho ex-boyfriend, some purloined silver and skeletons in just about everybody's closet!  There were some laugh-out-loud moments, too, as once again, &#34;the course of true love never [does] run smooth.&#34;  An all-round delight - now I have to look for the others in Lynn's Mardi Gras series."
147,5,"Makes you stop and think, can't wait for the sequel"
148,4,My kids love this book!
149,5,great book!!
150,5,Bought to share with others. very good book.
151,5,Exactly as described. Thanks!!
152,5,"One of the most delightful reads I have had in a long time. Treats life in a retirement community with truth, humor, compassion, sadness, and hope. Shows how old age - and death - is the great equalizer. It makes me look at folks my age with greater understanding: how we are all in the same boat and just working real hard to keep going trying to grab joy and contentment wherever we can find them."
153,5,"I'm new to tarot and this is one of four decks i purchased. The card stock is nice and the size of the cards is easy to handle. I've been shuffling and they're breaking in well. The graphics is pleasant tad easy to read. I'm not a mystical person so these cards are for guided meditation. I like that the artwork can hold so meaning different meanings and be read differently depending upon placement in the spread and where my mind is at the time. The art is nicely done, the colors and the line art are pleasing to me. I'm happy with this purchase and recommend this deck to all."
154,5,A MUST READ! Highly recommend.
155,5,godly
156,4,This books spans 40 years of policing in a rural Georgia town beginning in the early 1920s. I was concerned that the book would not be engaging since I knew the outcome from having seen the mini-series years ago. I was pleasantly surprised and was invested to the last page. The book deals in depth with the discrimination of that time and the author's writing style made me feel that I really knew the characters.
157,5,I collect books and my wife likes to bake. A Win-Win for us. The book was printed in 1963 and is out of print. I was lucky to find this new one (but with a worn dust cover) through an Amazon retailer.  It has her personal collection of recipes plus older ones she collected. Each section starts with a personal story by her.  It is enjoyable to read the older recipes and the type of foods eaten in the past. I found out about it through the Pepperidge Farm website.
158,5,Fast shipping and great read. This is my sons favorite author
159,5,Great book for Filipinos and non-Filipino's. We should teach our children our native tongue even if it's going to be their second language.
160,5,This book arrived in excellent condition.
161,5,"Strega is classic Andrew Vachss. His detailed character development paints an intimate and personal view into Burke's world where he & his colorful 'family' provide justice to victims of some of society's worst predators.  Set within the fringe elements of society, although Vachss' Burke frequently violates the statutory criminal codes, Burke always remains true to his personal code and unquestionably loyal to his family.  -- Although the subject of this story is somewhat unsettling, as are the villians in many of Vachss' novels, this book is a must read for any Burke follower or fan of noir type fiction."
162,5,Great book! One of my all-time favorites. It is a required reading for an English class but personally I treat it as a recreational read. Would recommend to anyone
163,5,Very thoughtful and clever book about triumphing and overcoming the unfairness in life. A lesson for both young and old... I read it with my 10-year-old and it was enjoyable to us at different levels. It's such an intricate yet simple story. Ms. Ritter created a magnificently intelligent book. I can't wait to read more from her!
164,5,It was very helpful for details on portraits
165,5,Pocket ready and sound counsel on the Scriptures.

169,4,"Alexander McCall Smith transports me to gentle refined place.  The mystery is not epic it is everyday life, solved in an everyday way.  There is tradition, charector, ethics and just plain old good sense.  I love the strength of the charectors always holding true to their quirkiness yet strong enough that I care for them.  Hope this serious continues for many years !"
170,5,"I must tell you first, I am not a fan of star trek, but I found this book to be very interesting. Nimoy gives the listener a very different take on an autobiography. I really enjoyed listening to him explain what it was like to develop, and bring life to a character that has come to define a television program. Withouht star trek, star wars would of course not exist."
171,5,"These girls are the BEST!!!  I have all of there cookbooks and their recipes never disappoint!  Every single thing looks delicious in this cookbook and I love that they are all healthy recipes.  I have already made a few things from the book, some of them several times.  The taco chicken is a staple in our house it is so easy and delicious and my whole family LOVES it!  We also love the healthy whole grain waffles."
172,5,"Very cool informational cards that should be helpful during our family hikes this summer.  The pictures are clear and the breakdown of which part of the plant is useful is... well, useful!"
173,5,"Once again was very happy good shipping, a good book to learn more about the bible and r past. Would buy from again."
174,4,Great book. Started off slow but keep at it. Well worth the reading.

179,5,"this is really awesome comic, thank you my friends :)"
180,5,Awesome book! I love it. I even bought some to give to my friends. This is a book to read if you want help in any type of relationship.
181,3,The Amazing Slow Downer software that came with the book did not work. It said that it was not a Hal Leonard cd. I hope to be able to use the book after I am more advanced in playing my bass guitar.
182,2,"I genuinely like David Weber's work as a rule, so it deeply pains me to write this review, but sometimes you have to tell the emperor he has no clothes.  Setting aside the much-discussed ending, as a piece of alien invasion military fiction, &#34;Out of the Dark&#34; actually had quite a lot of potential. It's silly to imagine that every alien species would evolve in precisely the same way with the same strengths, and indeed, the story explores how the conditions and history of an evolutionary track will largely define the final result. The aliens unified relatively early in their own planetary history, never faced any serious military conflict later, so never bothered to refine their military technology, conveniently making for a feasible conflict when they invade Earth.  Similarly, it's interesting how the alien assumptions of technological development fall apart due to the distances of space and the lengths of voyages. The challenges of resupply are evident, as are the opportunism evident in distant authority in the face of local fait accompli.  The first major problem is the consistently cloying strain of human exceptionalism.  Humans are special snowflakes.  They're awesome.  They're psychology is inscrutable. They &#34;don't have a [societal] submission mechanic,&#34; (Huh?)  By and large, no human goes quisling.  Every human fights to the death with courage.  By the end of the book, it feels like one has been subjected to a public relations campaign for the human species.  This leads immediately to the second problem: characterization. If you were to black out the names and locations, it would be almost impossible to tell which character was which. They're all noble, heroic, prizing individualism, love their family, are willing to fight to the death, think the aliens are idiotic, know the calibre of every firearm in existence and imagine that listing this off will somehow add to a sense of authenticity.  This problem with characterization extends to the aliens, as well. They truly ARE idiotic, and while somehow the human psychology is perfectly equipped to adapt and triumph, the aliens simply can't pull their acts together. This presents the fundamental problem that the aliens just don't feel like a challenge; much like Weber's &#34;In Death Ground&#34; where there's no tension because you already know the war's in clean-up mode, in &#34;Out of the Dark&#34; even when the aliens do well, it's simply due to luck, numbers, or technology, and never because they present an interesting or intelligent challenge.  The aliens as a whole are painful to read. To a one they thrash about with no real idea what to do, befuddled, adrift, unable to understand or adapt to humanity's tactics. Instead of making aliens who are genuine characters with different attitudes, goals, allegiances, preferences, tactics, their differences exist only in the ruminations in their heads rather than in their actual actions - take out the interior monologues, and as with removing names and locations from the human characters, I would challenge anyone to tell the difference between any of the alien characters.  Give me C.J. Cherryh or LeGuin or Niven or Pournelle who made their aliens not buffoons and punching bags for their human characters, but different...alien.  These guys are caricatures and jokes. Bad jokes. Make us, if not sympathize with the aliens, understand their motivations, their dilemmas.  The story meanders.  As other reviews have noted, it lurches into Deus Ex Machina.  Characters are introduced who don't do much.  The characters who are introduced do pretty much exactly the same thing, just in different locations.  There's certainly no sense of character arc, of development - nobody really changes.  Finally - and here I'll speak obscurely to avoid spoilers - the twist at the end of the novel could have been interesting and clever, but its telegraphing was woefully inadequate and the delivery unimaginably cliched.  I mean, you're going toset part of this in the country of [REDACTED] and the leader of the [REDACTED] is [REDACTED]?  Seriously?  You couldn't do better than that?  In summary, the idea behind the book was interesting.  This story could have been awesome, even a classic.  As a fan of Weber's other work, I found the implementation deeply disappointing and far below his normal level of storytelling."
183,5,"Have you ever had a book completely surprise you? This one certainly did!<br /><br />A perfect mixture of romance and mystery, Johnson produced a story that sucked me in right away.<br /><br />First off, it is set in New York City. WINNING! Secondly, the main character reminded me of actress Kate Hudson in the movie &#34;How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days&#34; - she's a gutsy investigative journalist stuck in a job at a glamorous magazine, but dying to write about something more meaningful than juice diets or sex positions. MORE POINTS! Add in the backstory of first love, and the courage of a twin battling fatal cancer, and I was SWOONING! Not to mention the whole attempt at bringing down a shady sex trafficking organization? HOOKED!<br /><br />Was the writing perfect? No. There were plenty of cliches. Plenty of overused metaphors. Plenty of over the top, dramatic inner dialogue.<br /><br />But you know what? I DIDN'T CARE.<br /><br />The plotline and the story was so good, all of the things that normally irritate me didn't seem to matter so much.<br /><br />Looking for a great weekend read? Look no further. Say the Word is the one."
184,4,"This is a great photo book! I give it 4 instead of 5 stars, only because some of the photos are printed in reverse. Most of the photos are from Eva Braun's original photo albums in the US National Archives (some of these albums actually belonged to Eva's friend Herta Schneider). Eva and her sister Gretl and friends were avid photographers, and this book is full of Eva's snapshots taken in and around Hitler's home the palatial Berghof in the Bavarian Alps above the town of Berchtesgaden (on the Obersalzberg mountain). The photos show Hitler in candid views at home, Martin Bormann, and Hitler's adjutants, secretaries, and support staff, not to mention Eva and Gretl Braun and their friends. Also photos taken at the famed Eagle's Nest (Kehlsteinhaus)."
185,5,All went as expected and hoped! :)
186,1,"The protag Detective Gavin, D is a despicable, idiotic coward with a side of cry baby. He decided to stay in the closet in college before he met his wife. He lied to her about wanting to buy  house, kids, promo ladder. Five year later, bill comes due, drags his feet. By now he's more about his job than about her. He meets Ben in his current case. Can't get him out of his mind. Wife and father gangs up on him at Sunday brunch with family about moving up the ladder and having kids. Argue with wife and decides to cool down by going to a coffee shop and happens to meet Ben again. They connected. On his way back home driving, you would think by now he would have man up and tell his wife the truth, but no. He's driving back trying to keep the status quo with his wife. What a dirt bag. All because he didn't have the guts to come clean. So he catches his wife cheating on him with his detective partner. How cliche. He get on his high horse because his wife cheated on him. What a douche especially when he didn't even have a high horse to sit on to begin with. He was acting all self righteous. This is only just the first few chapters of the story and it just goes downhill from there. So he tells the captain and he gets a new partner who is a beautiful woman name Hayes. OMG, Hayes made a better man than Gavin, seriously. Except for the female body, she's what I wish Gavin was like, not just the look, but the smarts, the professionalism, etc. The writer already tells you who the killer is in the first third of the book. The whole time I'm reading the story is like WTF! How does Gavin not see the clues that the writer literally litter all throughout the story? Cause he's stupid. His partner figures it out before he did.  I can't believe that he is consider one of the best detective in the department. There are alot of cheesey moments in dialogue and scenes. I hope never to read skate and bloom in a story ever again because it was mind numbingly repetitive as were the sex scenes.There are some good thing about the story the secondary character were way more interesting so that's everyone except the main protag Gavin. He got humiliated when his fellow officers came to rescue him after being tied up, plug at both ends, and caned by the killer Lane. He deserved the humiliation for what he did to his wife, but not the rest of what happened. Ben should get rid of Gavin, he could do so much better.  All in all this writer is writing a het romance in an m/m setting. She need to take some writing and grammar  classes, use a thesaurus, find a good m/m writer as a mentor, as well as a good editor and proofreader. This story is a bit of a hot mess. If you would like to read similar stories done by some awesome and  consistent writers try Josh Lanyon and he does it with humor, Kaje Harper, James Buchanan, and my all time favorite Brit J L Merrow, with great British humor to boot. They write men like men and not wussy girl."
187,4,"After Robert Bly wrote his book Iron John, there were several books written in its wake about masculine spirituality and this is one of them. Robert Bly’s discussion of Grimm's fairy story &#34;Iron John,&#34; relates how a young boy discovers a rusty, hairy, and seemingly dangerous wild man in the dregs of an old pond, a modern man has to dive &#34;down&#34; into the pool of his unconscious in order to rediscover this wild part of himself. Iron John, the scary figure he encounters there, only seems dangerous because he is so fierce and hairy. Actually, as the smooth and fearful &#34;momma's boy&#34; Jacob discovered when he finally worked up the courage to meet his wild and hairy brother Esau, the Wildman can prove a loyal, generous, and powerful ally.<br /><br />Jesuit theologian Patrick Arnold believes that the male spiritual journey has four &#34;moments&#34; in cyclical progression. The first stage is the &#34;static feminine&#34; which is marked by a lack of individuality. It is the womb, the home, and Mother Earth, but also the tomb.<br />Then comes separation, in which the male abruptly leaves home. This is the &#34;dynamic masculine.&#34;<br /><br />Following this solo adventure comes the &#34;static masculine,&#34; in which the results of the quest are consolidated in &#34;civilization&#34; and institutions, i.e., patriarchy.<br /><br />The fourth &#34;moment&#34; is the &#34;dynamic feminine,&#34; in which the individual breaks away from the crowd by spontaneity. When the results of this stage are in their turn consolidated--for example, if one has become proficient in a hobby--one has once again entered the &#34;static feminine&#34;.<br /><br />But men are under attack and masculinity is breaking down. Misandry pervades Church and society.<br />I greatly warm to this: For many years liturgists felt that highly formalized worship services bored people and turned them off; &#34;creative&#34; liturgies were proposed as the solution. Unfortunately, the resulting Butterfly, Banner, and Balloon Extravaganzas severely alienated many men……. ceremonies that are entirely nice, sweet, and happy usually strike men as phoney and completely unconnected with the harsh world they experience every day<br /><br />I also like his comments on weddings: One of the most alienating worship services that most men ever encounter is their own wedding ceremony. The blunt truth is that Christian nuptials are rarely celebrated anymore as a rite truly sensitive to the spiritual needs of both husband and wife. On the contrary, the typical wedding is often a once-in-a-lifetime chance for the bride and her mother to fulfil their childhood fantasies.<br /><br />Abraham’s archetypes are Patriarch and Pilgrim because he shows a pilgrim's faith and a patriarch's love.<br /><br />He may never actually have lived other than in campfire stories told to people about their wandering origins and taught values such as hospitality and virtues such as fidelity to God<br /><br />Abraham left the sunny land of his golden retirement years to set off in search of a promised land, unlike the sick Patriarch who hates change.<br /><br />He dubs Moses ‘Warrior and Magician’ and says that it’s quite likely that he existed, given the large amount of references to him as a pivotal figure in the Bible.’<br /><br />Most of us tend to think of the Old Testament as a violent book, but in the Priestly writings (Genesis-Numbers), military violence is rare. Moses' &#34;arsenal&#34; does not include a single bona fide &#34;weapon&#34;.<br /><br />Next, the author turns to Moses as Magician: The only &#34;weapon&#34; Moses used in his battle with Pharaoh was his staff, symbol of the archetype of Magician. Moses warred against Pharaoh, his evil magicians, and the entire Egyptian army with a mere staff — a magic wand -- by which he invoked Yahweh's Deep Magic (Ex 7-11).<br /><br />Solomon’s archetype is that of King. Men still attain to positions of power over others, as political leaders, religious superiors or bosses of business and need to avoid becoming a Tyrant.<br /><br />Kingship was controversial any in ancient Israel. When anyone mentioned “king,” many Hebrews could only hear the word “Pharaoh”.<br /><br />However, isolated tribes led by old sheiks were threatened by the Philistines threat so Saul had the opportunity of uniting the scattered clans into a Hebrew kingdom under his leadership.<br /><br />Solomon was  legendary for his power, abundant wealth and wisdom<br /><br />Solomon knew that sacred kingship is not just a political position, but a spiritual vocation; not just a role of power, but a service of responsibility. For the Sacral King thinks of himself as an intermediary, both accountable to a High King above and responsible to his lowliest subjects beneath. He knows that, as king, he rules in the place of God himself. That is why such a great part of the Solomon literature pictures the king at prayer.<br /><br />Elijah’s archetype is the Wildman. It might conjure up an image of religious fundamentalists dreaming of the &#34;old time religion&#34; and preaching stark morality and wishing to trans¬form their nation into a perfect theocracy. Elijah and his disciple Elisha eventually succeeded in anointing as king the military strongman Jehu in a fundamentalist coup d'etat that toppled and massacred the entire ruling dynasty. He and Elisha are heroes of the resistance.<br /><br />Our literature and films are filled with Wildman fantasies: Tarzan, Robinson Crusoe, The Rainmaker, Crocodile Dundee and Dances with Wolves.<br /><br />Jeremiah is the archetypal Prophet.  A prophet is a &#34;channeller&#34; who confronts society with supernatural realities otherwise unavailable. Walter Brueggemann speaks of a &#34;prophetic imagination&#34; by which an individual is gifted with the ability to perceive and articulate boldly an alternative consciousness, to present God's way of thinking, feeling, valuing, and acting as a contrast to whichever particular dreary worldview is presently in vogue. The prophet is a kind of spiritual Pilgrim, ecstatically seeking new and deeper truths about the human experience than are available in our familiar domestic ruts. But it is what the prophet does with his visions and messages that reveals the spiritual virility of the figure.<br /><br />Jonah’s archetype is the Trickster. Antiquity valued the Trickster figure as an important part of religion. Its absence today suggests why modern religion is so devoid of humor and lacking in fun, and why men are often so bored by church.<br /><br />As might be expected, Jesus, as perfect man, has all the archetypes but the fool/trickster is especially notable."
188,4,"I loved this book and I think it is very detailed, helpful and to the point in each and everything she says. I can say this with confidence since I work for a well known lingerie brand selling nationally & internationally.<br /><br />My suggestion for the author is to try and give the book a more uplifting voice. That fashion industry is tough as it is and a some words of encouragement would not hurt.<br /><br />Still THE BEST & MOST COMPLETE GUIDE BOOK I have read about becoming a fashion designer."
189,4,Although I haven't had the time to read much of this book. I like the fact that I can go to the chapter that I need the most help with at the time. It is also a good review on things that I already know.
190,4,decent reference but quickly becomes outdated. as former emergency  management coordinater for a large city it is a opening preamble to bigger show
191,5,"This book was brought to my attention by a sister (family). Have now read the book 3 times and after some time to think on it, will read it again. This was a true Christian; a very courageous, decent, wholesome person. Have often wondered what it would have been like to have known him personally. Strongly recommend the book. Metaxas did a splendid job in writing it."
192,5,I loved it from the first to the last page and it is a great way to read abet the Earth-Romulan war at starts near the end
193,3,Good text. But this decades old 2nd edition (with the cover matching the one posted by Amazon) did not match up chapter by chapter with the 7th edition (with a different cover) that my fellow classmates had.
194,5,"Chase is really hot.  He is a rough biker guy, but also a caring sweet guy.  One look at Allie and he is very protective of her.  So sweet!  This is a really great book.  I can't wait to read the next one."
195,5,Hilarious!
196,1,"A mayor, but the book seems inconclusive to the understanding of management as to the chain of command."
197,5,great book received it in great time
198,5,great book!
199,1,"The author claims that this way of eating is a cure for many diseases.  However, if you have hypothyroidism or calcium oxalate kidney stones, this way of eating could be very detrimental to your health, a fact which the author does not address or even make mention of.  People who are hypo should not eat dark green leafy veggies or cruciferous vegetables in such huge quantities raw or cooked.  People with calcium kidney stones should also not eat all of the veggies and berries in such huge amounts as the author suggests.  I am all for healthy eating, but as with everything in life, moderation is key and do your research before blindly following the advice of someone simply because they wrote a book."
200,5,Good quality
201,4,Great cookbook but very few pictures.
202,1,"I have used spreadsheets since they first existed.  I'm dealing with Excel for the MAC, but some omissions are just terrible.  As an example, try to find the explanation for the Fill function under the Edit pull down doesn't exist.  You won't find it in the index.  I found numerous other examples when the text did not match the release and the Index failed. Copying cells with other cell references, do not adjust properly.  I attribute this to poor programming."
203,3,Some good design.
204,5,Awesome
205,5,excelent
206,5,Quality paper. Beautiful cover.
207,5,"Ostensibly,  this first of Grossinger's three volume exploration of &#34;conscioiusness-as-existence&#34; gives a full view (if not a reverent one)  to what scientists think they know about consciousness,  utilizing the full powers of the scientific method.  Though this depiction will please few such scientists,  I find in it a fair depiction of the scientific,  materialistic viewpoint.  And/but from the beginning,  however,  Grossinger is weaving in the seeds of his more transcendent viewpoint --  drawing from all range of personal and so-called &#34;esoteric&#34; experiences --  nothing held back.  If you,  like me,  can't put this book down,  set aside a week or two for an astonishing ride,  from quarks through galaxies."
208,1,Has very good information. Trying the diet.
209,1,"This calendar is ridiculous! There aren't 365 cupcake recipes in it, some days there are muffins, which are not cupcakes!! Other days they just change one ingredient from the recipe from the day before. As if you aren't smart enough to figure out if you want blueberries instead of strawberries yourself then just add blueberries instead of strawberries!"
210,5,Great book with lots of super information.
211,5,Very nice!
212,5,Greatttt
213,5,"It's a calendar.  It has the day's of the year on it, it does what it's supposed to do.  I only bought it for the images to put googly eyes and give my office cubicle a little bit of happiness each month when I reveal the next googly-eyed horse page."
214,2,The book was recommended to me by my doctor who knew Donovan in Asia<br />It was not as dispositive as I expected -- having been told how badly the Japanese<br />solders treated the Filipinos -- Donovan's made it sound like it was &#34;a walk in the<br />park&#34;
215,5,A timeless classic!
216,4,"The Scarlet Gospels by Clive Barker is long awaited for any Barker fan. It doesn't disappoint; a page turner. It will put to rest the Pinhead saga, but following the book not the movie (for those who only know the movie). He interweaves some Biblical references, but artistically, not factually.<br />My only issue is my own conscience in reading books based on hell and such. Where one time horror or sci-fi didn't bother me, now I don't want to read about evil and more evil.<br />If this is a genre you are okay with, Barker comes through with imagery that you won't need a movie to illustrate for you in your mind. It may even frighten you."
217,5,My girlfriend really enjoyed this Valentine's Day gift. Especially all the funny stories and quotes I wrote in the book.
218,5,Perfect for toddlers.  The stories are short and pictures are colorful.  My great-grandchildren love carrying it by the little handle.
219,3,Okay
220,5,Thank you very much.
221,5,My Star Wars Fan loved this gift!
222,4,Very informative.
223,5,What a wonderful book!  You really do want to read this one!  So much insight!  I read the whole thing and didn't put it down. You will too!
224,5,Great gift
225,5,"Thanks for the quick delivery. I was accepted late into this class, and needed it ASAP. You delivered quick. The book itself is a text book for my Medical Terminology class. Very clear and easy to understand."
226,4,This text works well as a supplement to an audio course.
227,5,Awesome and informative
228,5,"As always, I'm a continuing fan of Bill Geist.  His humor is down to earth, and satisfying.  Especially to those of us living in the real world.  I've been actively involved in the Little League scene, and while it truly is no picnic, it does have its moments.  And Bill Geist zeroes in on them perfectly.  To anyone who's been there and done that, and to everyone who enjoys the humor that life offers, this is a great book to read."
229,1,"Rev. Groeschel died real recently and at  his Funeral I watched on channel EWTN,  he had such specially marvelous words said about him in Obituary.  His books are clear, easy to understand.  He has our salvation in mind.  So.  I wanted those books.  Got 'em in good time."
230,5,This is a good read that has much down to earth advice
231,5,"I've followed Vani for a couple of years now. She's the REAL deal. She's recently rubbed some multi-national corporations up the wrong way, causing them to change their method of production at great cost too. It's really not so surprising that they are trying to blacken her name.<br />She's fighting for us all AND for our kids. God Bless you Vani!"
232,5,Item looks amazing as described by seller.
233,5,"Fantastic look at God's design with beautiful illustrations. A great book to have for your kids, grandkids, or friends kids when they visit. Really special book. 5 stars"
234,3,I Had a different endurance suit that was too big so I went a size smaller on this one but it is too small. So the suits are all different. Like most lap swimming suits this runs small at least for a tall person. Very nice suit though!
235,5,just started using it....great book....took lessons for 3 years...50 or so years ago....this book is great with the alfreds book one...they compliament each other...
236,4,Its very beautiful ..Only it had scriptures on each page. Which is not my preference. But that might have been my mistake...it might have been in the description
237,5,"As an acupuncture physician I've always looked for more concise (simple) ways to treat and I was introduced to Master Tung's Acupuncture.  All the seminars, etc are too far so I have read both major books on it but there is too much info.  I have watched webinars from two prominent practitioners and afterwords, I'm still confused. I have had the pleasure and honor to communicate with Brad personally and he has been so open to sharing his knowledge and information but still the imaging aspect has been a bit foggy.  I recently watched Brad's recent webinar on elotus and then followed it with his book and for the first time, this totally makes sense.  Brad has presented Tung's acupuncture in an easy, concise, organized fashion with examples, points, and fantastic diagrams. As he says, it's not about the points themselves but understanding the why they go where they do. I now feel so much better prepared to utilize the techniques. Thank you Brad for your sharing and so much caring for the profession and each one of us."
238,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed it!  FUN!  It aint War and Peace, but it sure is a great read!  If you ever dipped your toe in this line of work or were any where near these kind of men, you will bust a gut laughing.  These kind of men don't exist in the civilian world, but you can find them in Navy squadrons.  Enjoy!"
239,5,Amazing book!!!
240,5,"I'm going to have a hard time telling you how much I loved this book, but I'll try. I was mentally composing this review last week and thinking &#34;It's unputdownable&#34; and then it turns out I got really sick and I had no choice but to put it down. Which was okay because I just got to enjoy the book longer. Just don't borrow my copy of the book because of the germs I breathed into it -- although the odds are really slim I'd have let this book out of my house anyhow. Just saying.<br /><br />Ian Hodder is writing about an early human settlement in Anatolia, kind of like a beehive in the way the houses are constructed (entrance at the top, everything identical, ritual cleaning, etc) and this settlement went on to become huge, for thousands of people, and it lasted for a thousand years. The people themselves seem fascinating, burying their dead right in the house and every so often going back to retrieve some ancestor's skull or burying someone with someone else's skull. There's a fascination with wild animals and a disdain for domesticated ones at a time when humans were involved in wholesale domestication of themselves.<br /><br />And although archaeologists have found 650,000 animal bones on the site, and although paintings show lots of leopards and leopard skins, they found not one single leopard bone.<br /><br />Ooh. Mystery!<br /><br />Hodder's prose is at times clunky but at the same time, he's very thorough about explaining what he's saying, so by the time you get to a really technical sentence, you understand the whole thing *and* its significance. EG, Hodder writes &#34;The number of phytoliths displaying greater than 10 cells constituted less than 15 percent of the assemblage, and there were no wheat-husk phytoliths with over 70 silicified adjacent cells,&#34; and you don't think, &#34;Huh?&#34; Instead you think, &#34;Oh, WOW, really?&#34;<br /><br />Hodder also writes with class. He collaborated with a lot of other scholars and scientists and credits them right in the text, and where he disagrees with someone, he phrases it with the utmost respect. I'm going to look up his other books to see if he wrote anything else I might find interesting.<br /><br />Overall, yeah. Read this. This is cool.em right in the text, and where he disagrees with someone, he phrases it with the utmost respect. I'm going to look up his other books to see if he wrote anything else I might find interesting.<br /><br />Overall, yeah. Read this. This is cool."
241,4,good read
242,5,Great Item.
243,4,Excellent book but somewhat outdated at this point.
244,5,Highly recommend this book - Dr. Kita has a unique way of looking at things
245,4,"Andrea Barrett is a writer I had not heard of before, but I am so glad I picked this collection up. Each short story is extremely well-written and moving in itself, but they work even better together. I love the theme!"
246,5,"At a stage of life when I am trying to reduce the number of books in my library, I plan to make this one a part of my permanent collection. It is a beautifully rendered visual and verbal window into the life of a talented artist, Edward Shenton, as he grew from boyhood to adulthood, then became a soldier and engineer during the Great War. The drawings are exquisite and intimate. They tell Shenton’s story of the people and places he encountered during the war in a way that words could never do. I highly recommend this book"
247,5,Good book was delivered as promised
248,5,This was a gift for a child that hates to read.  He loves it.
249,4,"Ghost meets The 6th Sense meets a Lifetime Network thriller---fun stuff! Nothing too gross or profane, although future installments in the series have the potential for some gruesome moments. The characters are likable, the story has plenty of twists and suspense to keep moving along. I especially like the railroad workers who seem to keep odd hours....<br />Looking forward to the future books in the series."
250,5,very satisfating
251,5,These books were AMAZING.  I think they may be my favorite series.  I want my own Gideon Cross!
252,4,Interesting review of the life of a man who was very simple as to his faith.
253,4,"I'm not sure if I missed the product dimensions. Super cute book, but it is micro-sized. It's smaller than half a sheet of paper."
254,5,I always played with numbers. However I never got as good as I wished.
255,5,"My favorite Dynamite Payson book, the designs are classic and the book is very well written. This one's a keeper!"
256,5,"What is there to say that hasn't already been said about this book? It's a classic and Bronstein's writing style is clear and to the point. Truly a romantic, and his analysis and games prove that!<br /><br />This is a must."
257,2,"Unfortunately I made myself finish the book before writing a review. I say that obviously because it was quite irritating to complete. Few parts weren't so incredibly disappointing but I ultimately could not get past the constant repetition gnawing at my patience! I kept thinking to myself, \\""if she says 'that's what friends are for' ONE MORE TIME I'm going to rip the book in two!\\"" Not to mention the incessant reminder of how rich and famous Tully is at least once per chapter (I wish I were joking) while poor lonely housewife Kate can't grow a pair and do something for once. What happened at the end came way too suddenly. There was far too much to be desired with the plot as well as the short list of predictable characters. The only shocking thing that came to mind was the fact that Kate decided to continue a friendship with Tully after being undermined time and time again. If the intention was to make the reader hate every character then it did the job for me. I kept wanting to scream at Kate for being so whiny and pathetic and Tully for being ridiculously selfish and spoiled! Not even halfway through it was easy to become disinterested due to the fact the story hadn't really changed much. It seemed more like a tale of \\""this is what will happen if you get married and have children (lonely and unhappy) and this is what will happen if you actually pursue your dreams (rich and mostly happy) kids so keep it in mind!\\"" The decades chapters I would have been alright with had they been shorter and eliminated all the small details/references of pop culture. Actually I'd liked to have seen more details later on instead of just the early chapters since the middle/last half dragged on like a Sunday at church. I was sure this would be a great tale of true friendship for everyone to love like it was thrown at you to believe but I was proven wrong."
258,5,Daughter wanted this book and she liked it. We got it for her for one of her Christmas gifts.  We received it quickly and in new condition.
259,5,as advertised
260,1,"No access code with this book, and I bought it new."
261,5,"I received this before it was supposed to arrive,  and am so excited and blessed to share this story with my son. Ferdinand teaches about not judging people, and accepting people for who they really are.  Thank you for the great condition of this book we'll be using it for awhile"
262,5,A good read
263,3,"It was interesting but it has to be read accepting its wartime limitations. By this I mean censors restricted much of what Gibson was writing about. Barnes Wallace is never really identified and radar is &#34;electrical interception&#34; device. In the end one has to ask if it was worth it? Albert Speer the German industrialist says the prospect of a follow up raid on the dams concerned him greatly. But like so many of this type raid ,e.g., Schweinfurt,Ploesti, there was insufficient follow-up."
264,5,Book arrived on itme.
265,5,"This is a wonderful cookbook!  I am very impressed with the distinct and obvious overlap of the various European cuisines and cultures, which this book makes stunningly clear.  Anyone with Celtic and / or Scandinavian ancestry should treat themselves to this tasty compilation post haste!"
266,5,Fantastic book.  Highly recommended read.
267,5,Great history....great read
268,5,"I love the book keep up the good work Nicole Black,"
269,1,Book was misleading. Poorly written.
270,5,Heartwarming story that reminded me of my nephew with his PawPaw.  Great book for grandparents to give grandchildren.  I purchased 3 - 2 for gifts and one to donate to an elementary school library.  Highly recommend.
271,5,"JoAnn's book is a classic resource for professional technical writers. Not everyone understands that technical communication is a profession and that writing good technical instructions is something that takes a combination of talent, training, skill, planning and time. More managers need to refer to JoAnn's work in order to understand the continued need for professionally produced technical documentation."
272,2,so so
273,3,"Very very basic... would purchase again because of low price,  but don't expect to much!"
274,5,Simply an outstanding book one that was difficult to put down. Amazing how one man can accomplish so much. highly recommend.
275,5,Arrived on time and was exactly as described.

277,5,Great stories.  The grandchildren are enjoying!
278,5,"This book fills an important gap in the military-to-civilian transition literature, most of which is about making the physical or tangible transition: what to wear, how to translate military experience into relatable terms in interviews, and where to hunt for opportunities. \\""Pinstripes\\"" starts at first principles: how to healthfully make the mental and emotional commitments to yourself to be successful in a new world; how to \\""orient yourself, from the inside out.\\""    I am a former Naval Officer who has been a businessman now for longer than I served. But I sure would have benefitted from having this book in my hands two or three years before I made my transition. It will add validation to your very natural feelings of apprehension, and give you tools for success through the transition. \\""Pinstripes\\"" should be standard-issue pre-TAP reading for all transitioning military members."
279,5,FEW have walked the understanding of this man.
280,2,"I believe I've read pretty much everything Hugh Howey has written. I love his imagination, his originality, his worlds. This is the only book that I've abandoned, frustrated. It started off well enough, then turned into the most banal and uninteresting,, clichéed romance. Just yuck.  Sorry, thank you for all the wonderful works you've given us, but this is not one of them,"
281,2,Not a fan. Did not like.
282,4,"My boys are 5 and 3 and my 3 yr old especially loved this. A sentence on each page, good for beginners."
283,5,THANX
284,5,"This was an excellent historical fiction novel based on the real life love story of Robert Louis Stevenson and his older wife Fanny. I knew who Robert Louis Stevenson was, and that he was the author of “Treasure Island” and “The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde”, but I had no idea that his personal life was so dramatic and adventurous—a story that rivals his novels.<br /><br />A 35-year Fanny meets the 24-year old Stevenson in Europe in 1875. Fanny is in a bad marriage and has fled to Europe with her children to study painting. Eventually, her bad marriage ends and she marries Stevenson.<br /><br />This novel is a powerful study of two talented, passionate artists and I highly recommend it especially if you are interested in learning more about Robert Louis Stevenson’s life.<br /><br />This couple’s life is an adventure that spans the blog both on land and on sea.<br /><br />I bought the unabridged audio book of this novel at either Costco or Half Price Books."
285,4,Another sweet Carl story.
286,5,Great
287,5,"Man this was a great buy! My younger sister who was in her late teens didn't get the whole financial game (credit scores, loans, credit cards, etc.) so I bought her this book and she ended up working through it workbook style on her own. She loved it and credits it for helping her make good financial decisions."
288,5,I LOVE TREASURE BOOKS & WE LOVED THE TREASURE COAST~~THIS BOOK HELPED US TO PREPARE FOR OUR JOURNEY!
289,5,"Excellent book, I got so involved that I could not put it down. Tawny isn't happy about coming back to Camden Crossing, but someone has to deal with the ranch after her father's death. She left town as soon as she graduated from high school, unable to deal with the way people treated her after the accident. She was the only survivor, but thanks to a concussion and the trauma, she has no memory of the day the accident happened. All she knows is that her sister and one other girl are missing and everyone blames her for not remembering what she may have seen.<br /><br />The first person she saw when she arrived was Chaz Camden, who is now the sheriff. Besides being the brother of her sister's best friend and the other missing girl, he was also the boy she'd had a crush on. She immediately notices the changes in him, and how sexy he has become. She's attracted to him, but can't forget the way that his family treated her after the accident. All she wants to do is get the property ready to sell and leave town. There's an unpleasant surprise waiting for her inside the house - a threatening message, written in blood. Then, on her way back to town from getting cleaning supplies, someone runs her off the road.<br /><br />Chaz is stunned by the changes in Tawny. She's no longer the skinny kid that he remembers tagging along behind their sisters. When several members of the town want him to force her to leave town, he stands up for her, reminding them that she was a victim also. Chaz's own father is one of the most vocal, blaming Tawny for not helping find his daughter. On his way home from work that evening he finds Tawny's jeep in the ditch. He's disturbed to hear what happened and even more disturbed when he found the threats at her house. He's determined to find out who is behind them.<br /><br />From here things just get more intense as both Tawny and Chaz turn their minds to investigating just what happened. At first, every question they get answered just brings up more questions. Then the attacks on Tawny become physical and more dangerous. Somebody clearly doesn't want her digging and they don't want her to have a chance to remember. Then one question starts a chain of events that brings answers no one expected and one I definitely didn't see coming. That wasn't even the end of it, as there was one more twist that I halfway suspected, but didn't want to believe.<br /><br />The relationship that developed between Tawny and Chaz was one that did not go smoothly. Though he stood up for her, there were times that Chaz wondered if Tawny knew more than she was saying, but then he would feel guilty for thinking it. For the most part his protectiveness and the attraction he felt for her were his overriding feelings, to the point where he started to wonder if she would be willing to stay. He did have one bad point where he backslid and made accusations that he shouldn't have, but realized it once he cooled off. Tawny also found herself falling for Chaz, but couldn't see herself ever living in a town where so many hated her. At the end, Chaz realized the depth of his feelings when he nearly lost her. I loved seeing the way things worked out for them."
290,4,All the stories are really interesting. I thought it would be something my 9yo would enjoy but she's only been semi-interested. I think she'll appreciate it more in a couple years when its a bit easier for her to read.
291,5,thanks
292,5,she's adorable
293,4,Excellent research resource
294,5,Must have book for every teacher! Very inspiring!
295,5,This was one of my more interesting classes i took at Rio Hondo taught by the Author himself. This book was well worth the price and a defiant advantage to have this for the class. - Dadrian
296,5,Such an adorable book. We purchased one as a gift for my 2 year old nephew as well as my 3 year old son. The book itself has beautiful illustrations and sturdy binding. It is a perfectly sized board book and arrived promptly. Package arrived in perfect condition. Would recommend to anyone purchasing for a toddler. Very durable product and extremely satisfied with seller.

299,4,Good series for 3rd grade reader
300,5,Great book.  Takes golf down to the basics.  Anyone that uses these techniques will play better golf.
301,1,"Utter rubbish. It's nothing more than an opinion book with heavy reliance on discredited claims and makes the classical fallacies: Argument from Ignorance and God of the Gaps. If you're looking for a book to shore up a creationist confirmation bias, then this book is for you. If you're looking for a scientific explanation of the fossil record and information of what Evolution really is about and not what Creationists want it to be about, read &#34;Your Inner Fish&#34; by Niel Shubin or &#34;Why Evolution is True&#34; by Jerry Coyne."
302,5,"This book captivated me from the first chapter. How could it fail to when it includes such lines as &#34;I did not have a cultural reference point for proper dead-human-burning attire&#34; and &#34;I pressed blade to cheek and began my career as barber to the dead&#34;.<br /><br />I have always been fascinated by death ritual and Caitlin Doughty does an excellent job of educating us on the long gone practices of other cultures.<br /><br />As a girl that grew up in the south who's family still practiced the &#34;at home&#34; ritual, it is refreshing to see her be an advocate for getting away from the clinical corporate way and back to basics.<br /><br />Caitlin's sense of humor is evident throughout the whole book, and I recommend you watch her &#34;Ask a Mortician&#34; web series to give the book the &#34;voice&#34; that it needs.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this book to everyone, but be warned, its a no holds barred description of what happens to us after we die and nothing is excluded, even stillborn babies."
303,5,Needed
304,5,Great book that we all should read
305,4,"This is more of a seminarian's book than a layperson's book, but well done."
306,4,Very pleased!! I'd recommend to others.
307,5,This is one of the best comic books ive ever read... I recommend it to you all... The storyline is great ... GOD OF FEAR segment is really epic... Ive had lots of fun reading it... The art is great... I must confess i personally find the character of Azrael (Jean PAul Valley) Excellent... This should be readed by every BATMAN fan outthere.... This was originally published back in the 90s... This edition by DC comics its great compilation of the storyline in 3 volumes... Ive only had read volume 1 but i cant wait to know what happens in volume 2!
308,5,great read
309,5,We love Andy Stanley.  He stops and makes you think!
310,5,"Very good reading, it was an awakening for me."
311,5,"I enjoyed reading another book written by Jody Hedlund. She is the best selling author of seven novels and she currently makes her home in Michigan with her husband and five children. You can find out more about her at www.jodyhedlund.com<br /><br />Love unexpected is a romance novel and part historical with a little mystery thrown in. Emma Chambers desires a home to call her own. She can no longer travel with her brother Ryan. And she finds that desire with a windowed lighthouse keeper named Patrick. Despite Emma and Patrick's love for one another... Patrick's past, his dark secrets come to haunt them.<br /><br />This was another excellent read of Jody's! You are drawn into the story and the lives of Emma and her brother Ryan from the first page! This is a must read!"
312,5,"Don't Burp in the Boardroom is a great reference guide for new college grads just starting out in the work world...as well as seasoned pros!  It never hurts to be reminded of some basic rules of the etiquette road.  The book covers everything from what not to order at a business lunch, social media etiquette, appropriate attire at work, and more.  The author approach potential &#34;burps&#34; with good common sense and humor.  At times, the book is lol funny...especially when you recognize one of your own foibles in her examples.  Definitely a good read and valuable reference guide for work place behavior."
313,5,Excellent
314,4,"WEST OF THE MOON by Margi Preus is a unique combination of traditional folktale and historical fiction.<br /><br />Set in the mountains and forests of Norway, a young girl seeks to escape to America to join her father. The author masterfully weaves together traditional folktales and a young girl’s dreams into a rich story of determination and a quest for a better life. The prose is beautifully written and fits perfectly with the story’s themes.<br /><br />This dark story for middle grade children shows the harsh reality of hunger, child labor, and cruelty often glossed over in the folktales found in picture books. Preus skillfully examines the difficult decisions that must be made in desperate situations. The book provides a wonderful opportunity to talk with students about folktales along with the stark reality of the immigrant experience. Often our social studies curriculum explores the lives of immigrants without providing the context of their lives prior to their decision to seek a new life in another county.<br /><br />This well-research work includes an excellent Author’s Note at the end of the book. This section connects the story to the author’s family heritage. It also provides insights into some of the historical aspects including topics such as rickets, tetanus, cholera, and charm books. Finally, it discusses the many folktales references in the book. Youth will have fun connecting the specific folktales with incidents in book.<br /><br />The unique combination of myth and reality makes WEST OF THE MOON a book to revisit as you put together your “best of 2014” list.<br /><br />With recent interest in stories related to the Brother’s Grimm, this book is one that may expand this interest into other regional folklore.<br /><br />To learn more about the author, go to http://www.margipreus.com.<br /><br />NetGalley ARC"
315,5,"Lone Survivor definitely earned the title as #1 National Bestseller from the remarkable story of Marcus Luttrell (Navy Seal). Eyewitness the account of Operation Redwing from Marcus’s eyes and experience the emotional/brotherly courage of Seal Team 10. Fritz Lanham stated, “One of the most gripping and heartbreaking descriptions of heroism in combat to come out of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq…An astonishing survival tale.”  Reading Lone Survivor will definitely change your life on how you think about our soldiers serving the country and the things they sacrifice for us all. The book itself covers not only the Mission in Afghanistan, but starts from the beginning on why Marcus wanted to join the Navy Seals in the first place. One weakness in the book you should be cautious about is viewing the photos before reading the chapters. Other than that the book is jam packed with such emotion you will be forever grateful for the courage and patriotism of these hero’s. From page 1 you will be so involved with the story that you will not be able to put the book down until you reach the back cover. Lone Survivor is by far one of my favorite books to read and I will always remember the courage of American Soldiers. This is a must read for everybody!"
316,5,"Not only is this book a must read for recent college grads about to enter the workforce, it's a must read for any aspiring professional.  The messages in this book will make you reflect and you won't see the results overnight...you'll see a gradual shift in your thinking and your actions that will result long term personal and professional growth."
317,5,"TL;DR: Beautifully illustrated, turns a classic song into a great bedtime read.<br /><br />I am a Disney JUNKIE so I'm probably weird in that I really enjoy the It's a Small World Ride. In fact, I even like listening to the song! But really even if you don't like listening to the song, you can still enjoy reading this book to your kids. It has a really good message and in spoken form the message comes across a lot clearer than it does on the ride- plus it doesn't get stuck in your head like the tune does!<br /><br />The pages are beautifully illustrated and my kids love looking at the pictures of kids in different parts of the world. And who knows, you might pop in the CD and end up liking the song itself too! Okay well it was an added bonus for me anyway. I hear it come on and imagine myself in Fantasyland escaping the heat."
318,5,Excellent Book.  Don't wait to buy it.
319,5,The first book on NDE's I ever read and I was beyond impressed with the afterlife.  Love is the connection for all of us.
320,4,"Reading an anthology is always a bit of an adventure. You never know what the next story will be, genre-wise, stylistically, or regarding content. In the past, I’ve enjoyed other Fiction Writer’s Group anthologies, so I gave this one a try. I enjoyed it. The stories are as varied as the authors, delving into fantasy, the supernatural, true life, and sci-fi. All of the pieces have merit, exploring heroes and villains, including an intense look at PTSD in Anthony Hulse’s “Quest for Pain,” an eccentric dive into a pool of growing in “Life Sucks” by Renee La Viness, and an interesting exploration personifying Past and Future in Angel Cox’s “Go Toward the Light.” A child’s love for her pet transforms her into a hero in TD Harvey’s sentimental story. Jada Ryker writes of the heroism of love in “As the Crow Flies,” and Gene Le Viness’ “Truth About Tony” was adorable. “Let Sirius Into Fire Melt” by Roy C. Booth and R. Thomas Riley put me in mind of “Unbreakable.” My favorites include the quirky “Matter of Extraction” by Lynn Mahoney, “Everyday Heroes” by Don Miskel (who wrote an adorable bio as well) and Pam Murray, and “Alastair” by Debbie Manber Kupfer.  This book of short stories might be best defined by this quote from “Red Brick and Humble Pie:” “It’s not who you were, brother. It’s who you have become that matters.”"
321,5,"Wonderful book!!! This is a collection of essays that were sermons by Rev Kraft. They are concise, clear, simple and yet meaningful. They are not religious but they are spiritual. I read one each day to let the message be absorbed. You are not asked &#34;to believe&#34; anything but rather to contemplate your current state of being and your relationship to others. Well done Rev Kraft, please write another."
322,5,This book will change your life! I love this book!
323,5,"as expected, has nice pages with pictures on them.  Bought as a gift"
324,5,VERY GOOD.
325,5,It is a Christmas gift and just what they want

335,1,chords all mixed up in this book--very confusing--gave it away
336,5,This is a very well written memoir. She kept my interest and it was very hard to put down. There were moments where I cried for her as she suffered at the abusive hands of predators. She had some tragic adventures and some wonderful adventures. I admire her determination to change her destiny.
337,5,Deep and clear
338,5,"This semi-ancient little book rings as true now as it did when written.  It also helps with rowing, and probably any other sport which requires focus, balance, strength and understanding of the goals of the sport.  I re-read it, quote it, and recommend it to others."
339,5,Excellent comparison between the Law and grace. Found the author to be very honest and open about his own struggles.
340,5,"Of enormous use to people doing research in Cook County, Illinois, this book is a highly focused finding aid for the myriad of important records in that region that were in existence before the 1871 fire.  It’s a heartening testimony that not all was lost in the Great Chicago Fire!  I can see this being on a Chicago genealogist’s reference shelf alongside The Handybook for Genealogists, Red Book (Eichholz), and County Courthouse Book (Bentley)."
341,5,Been using this calendar system for years.  Great product - love MOLESKINE!
342,5,"I'm just now ordering the book.  But I'm in favor of what I'm reading in the overview and reviews.<br /><br />I grew up on a farm where I learned the wisdom of learning from doing, and from watching others who do.  Then I went to college, where I got a BS in Business and a Masters in Education (Career Counseling).  While I learned many wonderful things there, mostly through friendships, and through learning the discipline and procedures of learning and researching, I have to say now that I wish I had just got busy working and doing at the same time toward a goal.  I admire Dave Thomas who did that and never even graduated from high school but started and ran Wendy's.  He just got busy flipping burgers in high school and kept going and growing and working and learning.  For a while he got into a relationship working for Colonel Sanders who mentored him further in Kentucky Fried Chicken.  That's what launched him into Wendy's.  Doubt if he ever would had he just stayed in endless schooling.<br /><br />A young man named Michael Ellsberg interviewed a number of millionaires and a couple of billionaires asking them how they learned what they needed to be successful.  It wasn't in business college.  All of them just got to work and worked with and for others who mentored them.  Read all about it in THE EDUCATION OF MILLIONAIRES.<br /><br />Robert Kiyosaki the famous and wealthy author of RICH DAD POOR DAD says about the same thing in his critique of modern American education in his first book IF YOU WANT TO BE RICH AND HAPPY, DON'T GO TO SCHOOL.<br /><br />American education has largely been taken over by saboteurs.  Read all about that in THE DELIBERATE DUMBING DOWN OF AMERICA by former official in the DOE Charlotte Iserbyt and in THE UNDERGROUND HISTORY OF AMERICAN EDUCATION by New York Teacher of the Year by John Taylor Gatto.  See both in clips on YouTube.<br /><br />Then there's the book HIDDEN DANGER IN THE CLASSROOM by Pearl Evans.<br /><br />For a century the realgoals of America's educational establishment hasn't been real life education nearly as much as it has been brainwashing Americans into socialism and a Marxist World Soviet Empire, and to work for corporations and government.  Knowing what I know now I'd never subject my child to such.  Learning and education, as John Taylor Gatto points out in his many books, is not necessarily the same as schooling.  Schooling often is counterproductive to real learning and a real education for a really successful life, and some of that is by design.<br /><br />At the core of that failure is the presumption of their being no God.  Not educating children to the reality of the revealed God is child abuse in the worst form, and our schools today are blinded crusaders in the no God premise.  That box is just too small.  Many of the world's greatest scientists and business innovators testify that it was the inspiration of the God of the Bible which helped them the most.  Read all about that in THE BOOK THAT MADE YOUR WORLD by my friend and philosopher Dr. Vishal Mangalwadi.  Get a real education, not just an indoctrination."
343,5,very interesting
344,5,"Vinniie's Wife combines narrative skill, elegant prose, fascinating domestic detail, lively characters--and compelling plot suspense. It is altogether a novel that is a joy to read with nuggets of surprise on every page.. Somebody looking for a picture of what life was like in Chicago households of the recent past will find it an unforgettably vivid portrait."
345,4,"I used this book as a reference for my thesis on marriage in St. Augustine, Florida, during the second Spanish colonial period, 1784-1821.  This and several other books served as background for my examination of the application in St. Augustine of the Royal Pragmatic on Marriage (real pragm&aacute;tica de casamientos).  Though this book specifically examines Seville in the sixteenth century, for me it brought out concepts and attitudes that informed the creation and application of the marriage law I am studying.  Mary Elizabeth Perry has made a deep inquiry into the status of woman in Seville at that time, covering all levels of social status.  It is well-documented, with an extensive bibliography."
346,5,"If you're on the fence about buying this, go read the excerpt about Navy surgeon Bill Krissoff on Huffington Post (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/howard-schultz/in-his-sons-steps_b_6135026.html). The surgeon who rhetorically asks, after finding out one of his gunshot wound patients had been shot again, but had somehow managed to stay in-country:<br /><br />&#34;Where do we get these guys? Krissoff thought. He's a war fighter. He's not going to give up. He's not going home. His guys are still there. You can't explain that to most civilians.&#34;"
347,5,Don't remember reading this one but I know I enjoyed it.  I gave it away long time ago.
348,5,"Excellent, practical guidelines for anyone wanting to get their financial house in order."
349,5,"This series is the best, by far, that I've found for teaching my SAT prep course. I'd recommend it to any instructor or student."
350,4,"As a long-time Dispensationalist, I was interested to read this book.  Although scholarly in style and tone, it was easy reading; I was able to finish it in a couple of hours.  Rainbow makes a good case.  Am I fully convinced?  No, but it has provided me much food for thought."
351,5,What an imaginable and fabulous book for a young child!  My grandson is mesmerized by the wonderful illustrations that enable him to practice his language skills by telling his version of the story.  It expands his imagination and helps him get in touch with his feelings and emotions.  Fabulous book for young and old!
352,2,"I found this book extremely difficult to read. The language was excessively poetic and made it difficult to understand the relatively simple concepts at hand. The authors also felt a little bit full of thenselves at times. While it definitely gets across all the elements of craft, the writing itself was just not for me."
353,5,Excellent book for toddlers.  Will order again for upcoming grandkids.
354,5,"Science based, but very readable. About waves only, not about boards."
355,2,"Long, hard to read, even for a clinical book."
356,5,Awesome book!! I have read several books about S.O.G. and L.R.R.P. And by far John Plasters books are my favorite.
357,5,"New to slow cooking, i have made several recipes from this book.  It has more interesting recipes than what you think of for crock pot cooking. Al. Are relatively quick to assemble, have great flavor, and dont use a lot of unusual ingredients. A decent selection of spices is handy but all are pretty standard for the U.S."
358,5,AAAA++++ Great book. Recommend it to everyone.
359,3,The Gregg company is awful and this product is sold with false promises of desktop software.  The publishing house is awful and does not respond to their customer support line.  The desktop software was defective and I have tried at least four times to have the issue cleared up.  I have received no support from the publisher.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS VERSION OF THE REFERENCE MANUAL.  Buy a used one and save money.
360,5,"&#34;Modern Man: The Life of Le Corbusier, Architect of Tomorrow&#34; by Anthony Flint is a biography that reads smoothly. Like historical fiction. But it's not, it's the man's life. Flint writes with wonderful flow and crafted a book that I couldn't help but love. The rhythm of this book marched to the beat of my heart.<br /><br />As a life long student of Art History I've dabbled a bit in the study of history of architecture. I've only had a snapshot of who this man was and his furniture, art, and building designs. Having the opportunity to read this book opened up my mind to other great architects who have graced our earth beside Frank Lloyd Wright. Many of the architects I've read about or whose buildings I've studied have been easily forgotten. Le Corbusier is one who will not be forgotten.<br /><br />His love of pairing design and functionality are lost on today's boring buildings. There's no beauty or true design to the structures going up today. It was a treat to visit the past when creative building design gave birth to creative furniture design; to provide comfort and beauty for those who lived their lives and did business within his designs.<br /><br />A great little book.<br /><br />If you are a lover of art and architecture, this is a book you must not miss.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and plan to continue learning more about this man and his creations. He's definitely left a bold statement to the world with his designs."
361,5,One of my most treasured books in my children's book collection.<br />Aho!  Michael Lacapa!
362,5,Maybe the best book on the subject.
363,4,"&#34;Play Framework Essentials&#34; provides a rapid introduction to the Play Framework. In 7 chapters and under 200 pages, &#34;Play Framework Essentials&#34; introduces Play Framework and covers details such as building and exposing web services with Play, building web application clients that integrate with Play, persisting data from a Play application to a relational database, testing a Play application, refactoring Play application code, and deploying a Play application. The book also describes how developers can take advantage of Play's concurrency model, security support, internationalization support, and caching support.<br /><br />&#34;Play Framework Essentials&#34; provides numerous code listings. These are black font on white background with no line numbers and no color syntax. The examples demonstrate applying Play in both Java and Scala programming languages and explains the relatively small number of features that are only available in one language or the other. There are also several graphics in the book that are mostly grayscale but one or two of them has some color in it.<br /><br />Although there are fewer than 200 pages of substantive text in &#34;Play Framework Essentials,&#34; the book still manages to cover a significant amount of technical detail. This is accomplished by spending very little time covering historical or background details of the Play Framework and jumping right into technical discussion."
364,3,"I am a huge fan of Maeve Binchy and have read all her novels. This would have to be my least favorite. Yes, it was compelling and I had to keep reading, but it seemed with each chapter I disliked each character more and more. Great writing as usually, but unsatisfactory characters for me."
365,3,Didn't finish reading for book club it was decent not enough time to finish HOWEVER I didn't feel the need to go back afterwards and finish it either.
366,4,"Very informative , came as expected"
367,3,"This is a pretty engaging book, despite the fact that I hadn't read anything else by the author. There are a lot of call backs to the previous books in the series. Presumably, there are larger character arcs that involve Martin and Birgit, Gregor and Katrin, and all of the other characters that recur in the series.<br /><br />At its heart, this is a rather basic mystery/police procedural. The mystery itself is relatively interesting, and the different paths that it takes in its solution were unanticipated by me (largely because I spent time reading it, instead of trying to figure it out. If you try to figure it out, you probably will).<br /><br />What sets this apart from your average mystery and police procedural is the character and attitude of Pasha, the main narrator. He's a rather amusing way of wording things, although it does, eventually, grow a bit trying. That's especially the case in this book, where the four children that Pasha is watching are incredibly irritating, after only the first few pages and only grow more so through the course of the book.<br /><br />That said, if you've read the Morgue Drawer series, you probably have an affinity for Martin and Pasha, and so you'll probably rather like this. If you haven't, you should be able to get by based only on what is here. Not a bad book, all things considered."
368,3,"I am a health and nutrition junkie. If there is a book on the topic I have most likely read it. I wanted to stop reading this one less then half way in. I think the title was a bit mis leading. The book isn't so much about super immunnity in the sense of not catching the next flu bug but more so for over all well being. Which is not entirely the same thing. It's flu season and I was anticipating the book to be more about that.  Only the first few pages really dealt with that. Then it became more about long term health. Which is all fine and dandy except I disagree with many of the foods he considers healthy or unhealthy.<br /><br /> If you believe soy is bad this book isn't for you. If you believe raw full fat milk and dairy products are healthy this book isn't for you. If you believe gluten is bad this book isn't for you.<br /><br />Sorry there are just much better books out there... wheat belly, grain brain, gaps, nourishing traditions."
369,5,Ann Ross's Miss Julia Series is wonderful!!! Miss Julia to the rescue is no exception.  Loved it!
370,1,"Very basic, not helpful, & full of teen level psycho babble. Don't waste your time with this book. Based on the author's training and education I expected real content."
371,5,"Although I've been reading books like this since roughly junior high, this is the first one that didn't make me uneasy at varied points. It's not science rejecting spirituality, nor is it spirituality rejecting science. This book unabashedly acknowledges the reality and even desirability of transcendent mind states, and it reconciles (for many of us) our desire for lives of purpose and meaning with our inability to accept religious dogma &#34;on faith.&#34;<br /><br />It is, at times, quite dense -- Harris is, after all, a neurologist -- but the relatively breezy first third alone is worth the price of purchase, and the remaining two thirds will reward the diligent reader with an open-eyed prescription for &#34;seeing&#34; unadorned consciousness."
372,5,"Prompt Shipping, exactly what I wanted"
373,4,"I picked up Robert Jackson Bennett's American Elsewhere after seeing it had won the 2013 Shirley Jackson Award for Best Novel. I started reading it tentatively, because well, I'm a bit of a chicken sh*t when it comes to horror, especially late at night, which is oftentimes the only time I have to read. I read Bennett's book under the protective dome of my night lamp, thrilled to get close to the horrors and creepiness it promised.<br /><br />In the first half, we are given a mystery. After settling her dead father's estate, ex-cop-with-a-painful-past Mona Bright finds out that she has inherited a house in Wink, New Mexico. Wink and the property become even a bigger puzzle for her when she discovers that her mother, before she was Mrs. Laura Bright—the woman who suffered from bouts of mania and depression and who later took her own life—was once a Dr. Laura Alvarez, PhD who worked at the Coburn National Laboratory and Observatory (for which Wink was established as a kind of residential compound for the lab's workers and their families).<br /><br />After settling into her new house, Mona starts to get to know the residents of Wink, and starts to feel drawn to its picture-perfect world, which is truly something out of a 1950s or 1960s sitcom. Pristine. Polite. Peachy-keen. But something isn't quite right; in fact, something is terribly wrong.<br /><br />Bennett shows writerly brilliance in creating a sense of unease that reveals itself with a slow hand and a light touch. A lot of it has to do with the setting of the novel. The American Southwest, with its towering mesas, treacherous canyons, and barren valleys, is the picturesque backdrop, and there are often rhapsodic descriptions of the landscape and big sky that give you a sense of vertigo. There's a wonderful scene early in the book as Mona is en route to Wink, where she stops and has lunch at the base of some giant wind turbines. It's an odd place for a rest stop until you realize there is no shade out in thedesert, and this is the only place to catch a break from the sun. Bennett perceptively describes the vibrations and the way the shadows and light intercut from the blades of the turbines: &#34;The sky is huge and bright, yet it is rent in a thousand places by the slowly swirling blades of the turbines. With the sun at the right angle they make a million dancing shadows on the barren hills.&#34; Poetic and foreboding at the same time. Other reviewers have called Wink something out of a David Lynch movie, and it's totally true.<br /><br />Mona is a shrewd study of human behavior and her keen observations and questions about her mother start to set off a chain reaction. We know something is even more awry in Wink when we meet a colorful gang who runs the Roadhouse, a bar and strip club outside of town. These criminals traffic drugs and do strange errands in Wink at the bidding of some unseen boss. Sightseeing is over and now questions need to be answered.<br /><br />What Bennett does so well in American Elsewhere is offer a nostalgic slice of small town America, as wholesome as apple pie on the surface, with something rotting and dangerous underneath. He manipulates placid descriptions of people and places, nudging small details out of place, all seemingly innocuous at first, but the sum of the whole off-kilter experience is goosebumps creepy.<br /><br />The reveal is slow but by the midpoint of the book we have a bombshell of a discovery. Then in the second half of the book, where Mona eventually finds out what the hell is going on, Bennett veers into science fiction territory. Think multiple planes of reality and perception, hallucinations that turn out to be real, and beings from another world. This is the part of the book where a kind of 'third eye' opens up in the narrative, and Bennett starts tapping some fount of the 'alternate reality' kind. After Mona has witnessed something extraordinary, she has an epiphany that changes the way she sees everything: &#34;Theapproximate qualities, behavior, and pattern of any witnessable occurrence are determined only by how it is like and unlike its neighbors; we know a thing only to the degree that we know what it is next to.&#34; In the same way, our perception of everything also changes. Wink and its true nature, and its connection to Mona and her mother, are finally revealed to us.<br /><br />American Elsewhere, for its sheer imagination and as a mashup of horror and science fiction, is a pretty compelling read. The first half is a meandering, moody burn. But in the second half Bennett starts accelerating the pace, throwing us plot twists faster and faster. Soon I was no longer scared at night but more amused—and exhausted. Bennett doesn't let you rest until a monster showdown at the end. I'm giving it 4 stars for the first half of the book and its buildup of creepy Americana and arresting images and scenes; 3 stars for the second half, when the horror show turns sharply into a Lovecraft-ian imitation."
374,5,A good read.
375,5,The goto book for understanding stick and rudder skills. Just buy it.
376,5,"I rarely read fiction.  I am bored by mystery &#34;thrillers&#34; because I can always guess the ending.  Not this time!  Mr. Bradley is one heck of a writer who gave me truth to fill in my real life suspicions about Lyme, an authentic cop's-eye-view of criminal investigation, and (for the first time since Alfred Hitchcock was on TV) a story I couldn't predict.  The copy I read was a &#34;loaner&#34; from a friend, but I am here to buy a copy to circulate through my family.  Everyone. and especially doctors and their patients suffering with Lyme, needs to know what Mr. Bradley has so skillfully woven into an enjoyable day's read."
377,2,"It was just a print version of every project she has shown on TV.  Not enough &#34;how to&#34;, just photos of previously shown projects."
378,5,"I admit it, I don't normally read books in this genre. I'm a suspense, mystery, police procedural kind of reader. I picked this up because the author set it in my neck of the woods and I love reading books by local authors. That being said, this was a wonderful read. Just the right balance between introspection and action, an excellent choice of words. Ms. Sophia pulled me into the story. At the end, I was crying. Beautifully done and I look forward to more by Ms. Sophia."
379,5,Way too cute patterns that are easy to follow and written simply. you will really enjoy the results of this w book
380,4,"I'm a big fan of historical/regency fiction, but to stop it from becoming 'silly fluff' (not my words) it has to be well written. Thankfully Jane Lark's writing always draws me in and she does historical well. I seem to be making a habit of reading book series out of order and this was no exception. I started The Passionate Love of a Rake having already read a later book but this didn't really matter because the plot mainly focuses on different characters.<br /><br />The story is essentially a second-chance story with a fab historical setting. After being sold off for social standing and being separated from her childhood sweetheart, Robert Marlow, Jane has spent years with a horrible and much older husband (the Duke of Sutton). Robert, now the Earl of Barrington, believes she chose becoming a Duchess over him whilst she thinks he let her go...<br /><br />Whilst Jane is sad and alone, Robert has become an infamous playboy. A chance meeting pushes them together again and Robert is determined for revenge. Jane wants acceptance and kindness. I enjoyed watching them dance around each other. Their banter was one of my favourite parts of the story.<br /><br />The book is sweet and sexy. Having already read the next book in the series, it was actually nice to see younger versions of certain characters, when I already knew where they end up.<br /><br />There were a couple of moments where I was concerned about the possible direction the plot was heading and when I wanted somebody to talk some sense into Robert and Jane.<br /><br />4 Stars in my Sky!<br /><br />I received a review copy."
381,5,"An easy compelling read with a moderate perspective that appeals to me. I read it as part of a study group that watched accompanying videos, which didn't add that much to the experience of reading the book."
382,5,"This book combines the best of a visionary manifesto, a soulful personal development course and a practical how-to guide.  Tara puts forth a new vision for what women's leadership could be, and then provides warm and clear guidance on how women can grow into their own authentic style of leading. It puts into book form the conversation you might dream about having with a visionary older mentor, if that mentor also happened to be a poet with a top MBA! I could not recommend it more highly."
383,5,This book is awesome! It teaches you how to make a good game. I am developing a board game and this book is my guide. Highly recommended.
384,5,"GET FIRED UP!  I love Casey's positive perspective and encouragement that truly leads you to believe that you WILL be successful if you follow the plan he lays out so clearly.  Great read for fundraisers in any genre, but I have used his principles as Stewardship Elder in my church, and I know they are effective.  This book provides interesting applications and comparisons that I had not considered - love being able to share this with other stewardship leaders and non-profit directors to help them fund their dreams!"
385,5,Essential
386,4,"Grandson loves books,  he's 1 now."
387,5,This book is just awesome. The recipes are delicious and it is so logically laid out. I love the weekly cookup ideas. Great way to start trying to eat Paleo or just more healthy!
388,5,Good book now I understand how the system works. To bad it didn't work fairly for Kerry Max Cook.
389,5,"A quite superb little book for young children. They will love this at bedtime, or any time really, reading the story with parents or grand parents. It is written in a very easy to understand way, beautifully simple, but with learning involved with the fun story. This is my favourite type of read for young children, gently teaching them things in a fun way. In this case about the garden and the creatures that live there. A good mix of writing and pictures to help tell the story. Highly recommended."
390,5,"This is the very best &#34;The Three Bears&#34; book ever! The artwork is the best, it draws you into the story! My mom did the artwork on this book when I was a child. Thanks Mom!"
391,5,"If you are a Supernatural fan you will love this book.  The author really nails the specifics of Bobby Singer's speaking style, which is quite an accomplishment and such a pleasure to read. I didn't want this book to end!"
392,5,Nice item!! Fast shipping. Thanks!!
393,5,Excellent mystery!
394,3,Book came promptly with the edges bent.  The book is suppose to be brand new :-(
395,5,Goes great with the book. Better than Cliff notes

397,5,great
398,5,"Worth much more than the purchase price if you are serious about online arbitrage!  A must read, but your head will explode with insight after you have read it a few times!"
399,4,"I'm with you, Erin Kissane (lead reviewer): Blindsight is stunning!  Unlike you, however, I did find it -- over its several hundred page span -- a little too much.  As the reader plunges further down the rabbit hole of this tale, the semblance of a narrative comes increasingly undone (in certain ways) -- in brilliant and eminently sound ways, for sure.  But in ways that make for an increasingly destabilizing fun-house hall-of-mirrors reading experience.  Don't get me wrong.  Watts is a brilliant writer, and enormously inventive.  I strongly recommend this book to any serious reader of speculative fiction -- to any serious reader for that matter.  It's just that I found the first half of the book more engaging than the second half."
400,5,"This book is hysterical, informative, and gift worthy! My whole family was laughing out loud from page 1! It was so interesting to get a glimpse into classrooms from around the US.  This is my new top student teacher and education graduate gift! Every teacher and parent needs a copy of this book!"
401,4,Buen resumen de la economia de Puerto Rico y lo que se tiene que hacer para mejorar nuestra produccion. Ojala salga otra edicion con datos despues del 2009 hasta el 2014.
402,5,"Finally, A book that explains why Even though I look healthy, I am falling apart at the seams. I am 3 months in on my autoimmune protocol, and am seeing halting of my symptoms of Psoriasis, Psoriatic arthritis, and Adrenal fatigue! I hope that I see reversal as well! Sarahs book helps me to understand the science of why I have been so sick. Thank you Sarah!"
403,4,Great book to craft an individual's development plan and a great understanding of the tools required to assist the individual. I highly recommend it.
404,5,"After the success of the Mahogany Murderers, Christopher Benjamin and Trevor Baxter return in this set of four stories based on the characters they first played in the 1970s Doctor Who Serial, The Talons of Weng-Chiang. The characters are a winning combination Neither one of them is brilliant but both are clever in very different ways, Lightfoot as the experienced man of science, and Jago as the street smart man of the stage, coming with a complete set of alliterations.<br /><br />The stories have a generally darker tone, but they avoid being dreary because neither are dark characters, but rather kind-hearted proper Victorians:<br /><br />1) The Bloodless Soldier-A somewhat typical but well-done werewolf story, though the cause of this one is somewhat exotic based on the fact that a scratch from a monster in India was responsible. This story served as a sort of introduction for the world of the series and particularly establishes Ellie the Barmaid as an ongoing character.The end elevates this one a bit with a great moment and fleshes out Ellie's character a bit. 8/10<br /><br />2) The Bellova Devil-Litefoot called in on an unusual case of a man who appears to have committed murder six weeks after being dead, almost certainly dooming the career of a Scottish pathologist who made the call. At the same time, Jago is incognitio to avoid a particularly nasty debt collector. However, they team up to solve this mystery and also find the truth behind the Far Off Travelers' Club. This story is very well done with a very good mystery as to what's really going on with the some Eastern European superstition thrown in. We also see the difference between the social circles Jago & Litefoot move in when Jago is able to enlist a grave robber.  The obsequious secretary/butler is a nice touch and works great when he acts as an executioner. I will say that the resolution of the problem with Jago's debt problems was a tad abrupt and convenient, though that's made up by the fact that itwas a little funny. 9/10<br /><br />3) The Spirit Trap: Jago is convinced that a medium Ellie visited was fraud, however the medium knows facts about the death of her brother Jim that she couldn't have possibly known. Jago seems to expose the woman as a fraud, and the duo assume that to be the end of the matter until Ellie disappears. This is a very spooky tale that tries extra-hard to avoid a supernatural explanation. 8/10<br /><br />4)  The Similarity Engine: Throughout this first series, one sinister figure has played a minor role in each case and in this one, that villain comes to the fore. Litefoot is asked to investigate a strange illness afflicting several moonlighting policemen who are unloading a mysterious black ore while Jago finds himself confined to a sinister &#34;hospital&#34; along with a policeman with a deformed face. This is a superb finale for the first series that manages to work through some great ideas as we  see the full extent of the villain's mad plan. Also Jago & Litefoot both have moments where their own unique styles of cleverness shine.  A solid conclusion 10/10<br /><br />Overall, this set left me wanting to hear more. Big Finish Does a great job in bringing the Victorian era to life and this was just a delight to listen to."
405,5,"I laughed, I laughed some more, and then I cried from laughing. This is a great book."
406,4,"Very tough for a layman to get through<br /><br />Not sure if I agree with all of the suggestions and recommendations here. Suggesting that the bailout should be been larger. There are so many other possible solutions that were never even considered.<br /><br />If you have no understanding of banking or finance or world monetary supply, you are not truly going to understand everything here. If you have a little understanding, you will gain deeper understanding from this, and find yourself looking up one term after another.<br /><br />If you are a student of economics, this book will make you think, and broaden your perspective.<br /><br />It may may you think about ways this all could have been handled better, which I think is the purpose of this book. Not necessarily to explain the political views, but to get people (esp.. YOUNG people, who will one day run our economy)  thinking about a BETTER way to prevent this, and how to handle the next meltdown. (which the author suggests is coming, like it or not)<br /><br />Scared me enough to start re-thinking how to invest and plan for retirement.<br /><br />If another RE collapse comes, I hope it's the day AFTER I reverse mortgage my home."
407,4,great
408,3,"I like the cookbook part for humans, and if she stopped there it would have been fine, but avocados, onions, tomato, tomato sauce- these are not good for dogs. You can google food bad for dogs, or go to the spca for a list. Also some of the dishes are heavy on cream and butter and cheese, while not necessarily poison, like the avocado, it's not going to be good for the dog's tummy or overall health.<br /><br />She says she's not a dog nutritionist, but since she is selling a book that is specifically for humans and dogs, she could have least checked out what they shouldn't eat, it would take a five minute web search.<br /><br />I gave the book a three because I enjoyed the stories, and the recipes sound downright yummy- for humans."
409,5,Good book
410,5,a beautiful book.  give you many ideas beside being a joy just to look at.
411,3,Book was in fine shape--more of a childs story
412,5,Great book.
413,4,"Diana Shapiro’s first novel, “Cupid Resigns,” combines mythology, mirth and mayhem to great effect.  It is often outrageous, sometimes far-fetched and filled with humor.  Think “The World According to Garp” or “A Confederacy of Dunces.”  Cupid is bored and wants out.  He is sent to Earth to conjure up one last great romance as a tribute to his demanding mother, Venus.  Unfortunately for the mortals involved (but luckily for the reader) the best laid plans go awry.  Shapiro’s characters are vivid, especially Renee, a grand old Frenchwoman, besotted with jewels, champagne and her own romantic designs, who anchors the story.  The language is rich and there are many memorable bons mots.  Shapiro renders Olympus wonderfully and captures New York City with incisive detail.  “Cupid Resigns” is an impressive debut."
414,5,Great book
415,5,Good book
416,5,Great
417,5,Great condition and great price. Thanks for sharing.
418,5,"Bought used book listed as &#34;acceptable&#34; condition--got book in at least good condition. Exactly what prof specified, at some reasonable savings. Usual complaint about the cost of textbooks from me, but this seller was excellent in terms of exceeding expectations. Interesting book in terms of content and may continue to serve my interests after the class is over. Ranges from the earliest artists and technicians to modern digital artists in a social context--an interesting case study highlighting the artistry and utility of a medium that for some strange reason everybody thinks they can do well."
419,5,great
420,5,Really informative and interesting!

424,5,wonderful book. A great resource book..
425,5,Great read!
426,5,I have read countless leadership books and they all either say the same thing OR have difficult to implement processes.  Tom Collins book is excellent.  The book is an easy read but what really stands out is the ability to easily roll out to your leadership teams.  A must read for start-up organizations and young entrepreneurs.
427,5,arrived on time and was exactly what I expected.  much easier and cheaper to rent than to buy.
428,5,"Martha Sarkissian's book is fabulous.  You give her lemons and she not only makes lemonade, she makes the biggest lemon meringue pie she can.  What a winner.  What a survivor.  This book could be a movie and a blueprint foundation for mental health.  Everyone can use a dose of Martha and the beautiful family she and Hal created."
429,5,Each book leads to the next and you will not won't to take a break between them.  The author has a flair for the supernatural and that along with full characters and beginning relationships makes these a favorite.  I will probably buy everything she has written when I get done.  This is a favorite author.
430,5,He already started reading it!
431,5,My son loves this series.
432,5,"Absolutely splendid condition and exactly what I was looking for, thanks!"
433,2,"This was a quick easy to read book. The author has a good conversational writing style. I was not as happy with all of the content. I thought this book was going to be more of how to deal with stress and being overwhelmed. Instead the book focused more on depression which I know goes hand in hand with the other two. In the book about a fourth of the way through the author divides the book up into sections on reminders, sin struggles, and trust struggles. He shares his personal experience on dealing with severe depression issues. The book does not address the fact he takes medicine for it. It is not a spiritual problem but a chemical imbalance. I am not sure this would be the best book to give to someone battling these issues."
434,5,the end of a great trilogy!!! so sad but oh my gosh what a story!!! RM is an awesome storyteller..i was on the edge of my seat for half of the book ..lenah kicks bad vampire booty..so sad about justin though. i wasn't expecting that.. def read infinite days vampire queen and stolen nights first!
435,5,We love Hermie and Friends - wish they were still being made!
436,3,"Have just read through Beyond Megachurch and Reveal, both from 2007, and wonder about the omissions in the former from the bombshells in the latter, particularly as they apply to the Seeker model.  There's a lot of good information but it seems updates on Megachurch dynamics need to be constant as they fidget like pieces on those old electric football games."
437,5,"I've read every book Jim has written including version 5, 6, 7 and now 8 of this book.  The book has a lot of practical ideas that you can use today to grow your business.  His books and advice is solid.  In his book he says I teach people how to establish multiple sources of legitimate automated online income without having to learn a bunch of new skills.  I've found that to be true.  He also has a chapter devoted to offline business but many of the chapters will be helpful even if your business is primarily offline."
438,3,"Coming from an Acadian background, being married to a direct descendant of Rene LeBlanc, and speaking Acadian French, I was happy to fill in some gaps in my knowledge. Sadly, the editing was dreadful, with so many errors in spelling, syntax, punctuation, etc etc getting in the way of an otherwise potentially Good Read."
439,5,"A beautiful story - both the love story between Isabel and Mac and the continuation of the story of Magnus, Annelise, Eva and Ramon.  The last four are the characters who are shown in the past as part of the Danish resistance against the invading Nazis.  While it is a fictional account, I am sure there is enough real history included to how heroic the members of the resistance were.<br /><br />I enjoyed the developing relationship between Isabel and Mac.  It grew in a way that felt real - not rushed.  While this book does stand-alone, I recommend that you read the series in order, starting with &#34;The Apple Orchard&#34;.  I've only read a few of Ms. Wiggs novels but I will certainly look for others in the future."
440,5,fun audio
441,5,"Amazon's vendor stated that this book was slightly used but this book arrived securely packaged and is practically brand new.  My piano teacher gave me his book to use to help develop a play list for some piano playing that I do at an assisted living facility, and I fell in love with it.  Unfortunately, he did want it back eventually and so now I have my own copy!  Very happy with purchase and will definitely order from this vendor again.  Right now this is the only Readers Digest songbook I have but based on the songs/arrangements in this book will definitely order more.  You can't go wrong with this book if you're an intermediate player and enjoy all the &#34;classic&#34; American standards."
442,5,just as described
443,5,Very fast shipping! Thank you so much! Saved me A LOT of money.

446,5,LOVED IT
447,5,"I'll just second the other reviewer's opinion that this book and the two companion volumes are very well done.  They present a high-quality positionally-oriented White repertoire.<br /><br />Unless you are a budding GM or World Champion, this repertoire series is probably more practical in terms of the theory that must be mastered than some of the other denser White repertoire series (e.g., Khalifman's &#34;White According to Kramnik&#34; and Avrukh's two-volume &#34;1. d4&#34; opus).  It still manages to fight for an advantage and to choose principled lines, and to present a repertoire which you might occasionally need to tweak (after all, chess theory is constantly evolving) but will never need to radically change.  All of the lines chosen by Kornev are sound and will stand the test of time."
448,5,Great item!
449,5,Great puzzles.  Easy to see.  Very enjoyable and lots of fun.  Would highly recommend.
450,5,"This book is very delightful and interesting, after reading one story I could not wait to go to the next one.<br />JLerouge"
451,5,Love these books
452,5,"I hate that a lot of people are saying they didn't like any of the characters, specifically Lindsey Hutch. You are all past/present Lindsey Hutch's in denial...deal with it. Lindsey Hutch's exist, a lot of Lindsey Hutch's exist. You don't understand.<br /><br />Oblivion is a great book with suspense on every page. Callie has flaws and that's okay. Cookie cutter characters suck and that's something authors need to understand. Oblivion is now my favorite book, Sasha is an amazing writer and everyone who disagrees is the stupidest person ever.<br /><br />Everyone who hates Oblivion, I hate you."
453,4,Good solid text book with a wide coverage of topics.
454,5,I knew from reading Wendy's blog for many years that this was going to be a great book with easy to follow instructions and fun photography. What I didn't expect was how much my kids would love it! They pick it up again and again and study each page while  pointing out things they want me to make for them (our copy is a veritable porcupine of post-it note bookmarks).<br /><br />A fun and useful book that makes a great gift -- but be sure to get a copy for yourself as well!
455,5,thanks for the book
456,4,"The book came in excellent condition I bought used. The book itself is great but you should have a little back ground in mechanical work. I know this is the newest version I have but some of the newer injection systems are not covered, great electrical coverage for all beginners and advanced. All in all a good book very well written."
457,4,The book that help start a food revolution.
458,5,"This book is very sobering. This book does a superb job of explaining the cocktail brewing in Christianity (western), which the Bible prephesises. I didn't know how the multiple author compilation would pan out, but was proven to be totally ignorant in my scepticism. In a subject matter such as this, with it's presentation of an idea that is so foreign to many of us, the different angles and viewpoints strengthens the case."
459,4,"Kit<br />Famous Country Star, the Sweetheart of Country Music. Lives her life in the spot light for everyone to see. She has had a rough past, she was homeless and fought her way up though the rafters to be a singer.  She is on the verge of losing her contract due to her stent in rehab. Kit has a depressive disorder and has to try hard to keep her head above the water and put on the &#34;mask&#34; that her label wants her to act like, even though she is not being true to herself.<br /><br />Max<br />Hello sexy firefighter!!<br />Max doesn't do relationships, he has been cheated on in the past and has sealed his heart off.

Of course Max, being a player, is fine with this arrangement, until he realizes that he is developing feelings that he afraid to have again. He has a hero complex and is always rushing into to save and protect Kit and second guessing his feelings as just a need to protect her.<br /><br />Overall this was a pretty good book. I would recommend it for everyone who enjoys romances."

462,4,Good condition as descripted.
463,4,Thank you. It was just what we needed.
464,5,"Excellent book, covers all the topics in the fundamental exam.. gives you a diagnostical exam before each chapter to se where are you standing in knowledge. Would recommend to anyone who wants to take the general test."
465,2,This book wasn't for me.... I found it very dry/boring and it couldn't hold my attention. I used it a little bit during a stress reduction class but I didn't get a whole lot out of the book itself.
466,5,"I love this book. It truly is a &#34;quick but interesting read&#34;. I purchased this book back in 1989, when I was just out of high school, and learned to love my natural hair after reading. To this day my hair is still natural. All young people, beauty school educators, and hairstylists that work on coarse hair should own this book."
467,5,"I haven't read it but considering I've enjoyed the entire series, I can't imagine I won't enjoy Kitty getting into and out of trouble."

472,5,exactly what I was looking for
473,4,"I love the way that the Pimsleur Language Programs build on actual conversation rather than getting bogged down in grammar.  The conversations are meant to be useable in daily activities.  Asking directions, ordering food, accepting and refusing offers to visit someone's home... Having said that, I wish that they included a reference book as an accompaniment.<br /><br />However the way each lesson builds on the previous one works very well.  I put the cds on my IPod and listen to them while driving and feel like I won't be at a loss when I take my trip to Norway."
474,5,it was rated as a great copy and that was so
475,5,I received both my books and I am just glad to have them. So I can get  to reading.
476,5,I am a 69 yr old great grandmother and I loved it!!!
477,4,"It's amazing to me that such a convoluted story can be imagined and placed on paper. I am constantly amazed by the mind of this author. This was not as fabulous as most of his other novels and now I have read them all, but nevertheless the story was compelling once all of the characters were developed and I was involved in the story. I highly recommend any of this author's books, though I would not suggest a reader begin with this one. I think &#34;Eyes of a Child&#34; would be the best one to begin with."
478,5,"Another really cute brother series for Lori Foster. I really thought Tangled Sheets (Cole's story) was really cute until I read Chase's story, Tangled Dreams. Now THAT was cute! and Mack's story was just plain HILARIOUS! All 3 were short, sweet and to the point. The only one I would have liked to have been longer was Chase's story but that just cuz I got a real kick from Rose and Burke's story! ;) lol"

480,5,"I highly recommend this book for any parent looking for a fun way to engage their youngster in discovering the wonders of Paris.  Clever and well-written, this book became our guide to a recent stay in Paris.  Book in hand, our 8-year-old set the pace, diligently making her way through the scavenger hunt, sweeping us grown-ups into the excitement of it all.  The book rendered the city and its many monuments and attractions accessible and understandable to our daughter; and, the book turned out to be equally fun for the adults, giving us a new &#34;take&#34; on Paris.  I highly recommend it.  The Lonely Planet &#34;Not for Parents Paris,&#34; which our daughter also devoured, served as a great companion.  This book would be appealing for a wide range of ages."
481,5,A very earthy look into Betty Whites' past.  A very enjoyable read.

483,4,easy to use
484,3,"I have always been a fan of the &#34;Tales of the City&#34; series and their author and have bought each new novel as it came out. Of late, the stories and characters seem to lack the vigor, cleaverness, and color of the early volumes. The characters appear to have grown older, but have not grown more interesting in any appreciable way. Unfortunately the last book is in that vane. Perhaps its time for the series to end as the author suggests it has."
485,4,"Haven't read it yet, but I like Fowler's other books."
486,5,Nice quality paper; envelopes have trim on them.  Very cute cards.  I live at the beach and have a dog that sits on a chair on my deck and these cards are very appropriate for me.

Don't bother with other &#34;classics&#34; label versions—they're often made with out-of-copyright text from a century ago, so they tend not to have modern concessions like quotation marks.<br /><br />Seriously, we all love quotation marks. Buy this version."
490,1,"I love the Great Gatsby, but found this a total bore! I'm glad I didn't pay much for it. Wish I saved a tree and downloaded it on my kindle, but thought a &#34;real&#34; book would be a nice change… I was wrong."
491,5,"It made me cries tears of joy, sadness, and just made me overall think it was for me. Buy it, you won't regret it."
492,5,"Thanks to the person who hipped me to the EC trip. I only was exposed to Mad Comics as a kid.<br />The cream of the crop of writers, artists. It's a must."
493,5,Ibought this shirt for my dad for fathers day and he loves it we have a Rottie named Max and the pic on the shirt looks just like him
494,5,Do you need to be inspired?  Order this book today!!!!! I could not put it down!  Just the inspiration I needed!
495,5,"This is my first review and my first Josie Litton book. (Unfortunately I started with the last book of her trilogy). But, is was so good that I wanted to get to know the others in the first<br />and second books.  Sometimes I scan sections of books because they are so &#34;wordy&#34; and<br />repeat so many things.  Not in this book.  I read every word.  Good story and I am looking<br />forward to reading the first two and many others."
496,4,This book was an easy read. The message was very clear and stated in such a way that made remembering easy!
497,5,"It was fun reading.  I am 75 and was a product of that generation, and have grandchildren in this generation.  I appreciated the young author's perseverance and work writing it for this generation."
498,3,"This book was ok, but for the new user, it was not very helpful- Many of the instructions did not MATCH the iphone 5C that I purchased, so it was hard to follow correctly.  It may be okay for a pre-user, but for a 1st timer, it was lacking."
499,5,"The book is not an explanation of epi-genetics per se.  The author posits that all birth defects and most diseases are caused by deficiency in nutrient intake or absorption.  His messianic message clashes predictably with mainstream medicine.  However his successes in preventing and treating diseases previously thought as genetic are convincing.  The stunning fact that laboratory monkeys are fed a diet containing about ten times the trace nutrients recommended for humans, should wake everyone up and take notice.  Wallach has set in motion an epic revolution, which will probably take many decades to be implemented and understood by most.  Unfortunately Wallach often presents hypothesis as fact which makes him look like just another nutrient prophet.  But like they say in China:  Mao may have been right only 70%, but he was a great leader."
500,5,"this is an amazing book, manly p has such great wisdom to share, the cost was awesome and it came fast in great condition, would buy from here again"
501,5,"Loved this book! Mr. Bolter made me realize my goals are right in front of me and that they are achievable with three steps; Change, Action, and Trust. He uses his own life experiences, both triumphs and feats, to explain the C.A.T. Principle.<br /><br />Change, Action, and Trust... Great words to live by! Thank you Mr. Bolter!"
502,5,"This is an excellent book....Initially, the first few chapters can be a bit stuffy, but it lays the groundwork for the entire book."
503,5,This is one of those books you just can not put down! It is exciting and suspenseful and kept me guessing all the way to the end. I loved it!
504,5,"I began reading Adyashanti's \\""Falling into Grace\\"" with a soup spoon, taking big gulps, hardly chewing. Before too many pages went by, I switched to a tea spoon and went back almost to the beginning and took smaller bites and chewed Adya's words more slowly, allowing the nutrients he obviously placed with care to emerge with each bite.<br /> \\""What would happen if we were fully able to be with what is?\\""<br /> \\""Conflict isn't inherent in existence. Existence is just the way it is...\\""<br /> \\""As we begin to meet life as it is rather than as we think it should be, as we let go of our need to control and continuously interpret our experience, we start to open to life in a completely new way...\\""<br /><br /> Two-thirds of the way through, I switched to chop sticks and as I saw the end looming, I'd grasp each underlined sentence and chew it until I was sure I'd gotten out of them what the author intended. Toward the end of the book, I was picking my way through with one of those tiny hors d' oeuvres forks. I literally wanted to read each paragraph twice before going on to the next. Amazing book!"
505,5,"Segall, born in Russia Lithuania, trained and resident in Germany as a well-known Expressionist, migrates permanently to Brazil where he becomes a significant symbol of modernism and an important model for native artists. This well-fashioned book provides a sound review of his life and work. Written both in Portuguese and English,  peppered with illustrations, a fair number in color, it is  probably the best source for the curious to learn about this notable Brazilian ( after three years as a permanent resident, he obtained Brazilian citizenship; this was years before Hitler came to power). While he never lost the flavor of the Russian background of his early life nor the German training and early career success , he found in Brazil a satisfying life as a well-trained artist who had found fulfillment of his career aspirations in what, to him, was a simpler, more primitive country. He was not a lonely modernist out of place in a strange civilization but rather one whose art unified the native world of Brazil with the art developments of more advanced societies. The essayists show his selectivity in vision, understating the modern aspects of the social world in which he lived to emphasize the romance of the &#34;primitive&#34; in a product combining elements of both approaches. The amalgam made him a primary influence in his adopted Nation.<br />The  book should be especially be interesting to students of modern Jewish art, those concerned with the romanticism implicit in Expressionist art, and those with Latin American concerns. Little scholarly pretension is nifest to confuse the layman."
506,5,"Patrick Taylor has proved to be a great storyteller in this book.  His characters are believable, even though exaggerated.  I chose this book for my book club, and found that all 20 members (both men and women) enjoyed it thoroughly.  Many indicated that they intend to read subsequent books in this series.  The author knew his subject, having a medical background and being from Northern Ireland.  His sense of humor and character development made it delightful reading.  I would recommend this book for anyone who enjoys a lighthearted look at the medical profession."
507,5,I highly recommend this one.....It answers questions and illuminates scripture that you never realized possible........as you study this book follow long the scripture in your Bible........
508,5,"Again Joe Stosh travels back in time to 1942 to give kids the opportunity to learn about Satch, possibly the fastest pitcher of all time in the Negro League World Series. And it was interesting to learn that the speed of his fast ball matches his character--fast talker, fast car driver, and more.<br />Using his magic baseball card as a platform, Joe Stosh gives kids a baseball adventure filled with excitement, drama, action, and lots of surprises. Wow! I can't stop reading it.<br />Dan Gutman  takes kids back in time to share some baseball history with one of the greatest athletes, Satchel Paige, that ever put on a baseball uniform to thrill baseball fans of all ages. Without giving away my age I can still recall watching Satch pitching for the White Sox at Comiskey Park. I like this story and encourage every youngster interested in baseball to read it and I give it 5 stars. Marvin P. Ferguson, author of THE UNKNOWN BASEBALL PLAYER."
509,5,I found this book to be really informative. I learned about wills and trusts and what each will accomplish. I was able to make a decision on what to do in my situation. I also learned what I should do for my business. I learned my business should be owned by my trust for best protection....a little known fact. I really liked how Mr. Smith used stories to make a point. The stories made it an enjoyable read. You wouldn't think Estate Planning would be such an interesting read! I would highly recommend this book.
510,4,It has helped greatly but I found at least 10 questions that were wrong.  Maybe on a later edition they will correct those errors.
511,4,At first I was a little sketchy on the book but as I continued to read the more interesting it became Cadee was my favorite character. Great job and I wish there was a sequel to this book.
512,4,"The Bat<br /><br />Mary Roberts Rinehart wrote this mystery novel in 1926 and others. It is still printed seventy years later. How many other mystery novels from that era are still read? “S. S. Van Dine”?<br /><br />The Police Chief wants his detectives to get “the Bat” (he worked at night). The best private detective firm in the country sends their best operator after him, without success. The underworld would also like to get “the Bat” but failed. He worked alone, no known moll. The Bat succeeded at robbery, burglary, and murder of those who got in his way. A newspaper editor opines that he comes from the upper class because of his brilliance. That private detective firm will assign Anderson to find “the Bat”. Miss Cornelia Van Gorder rented a house in the country that was built by a banker who died. Her maid Lizzie Allen doesn’t like the country. The cook and housemaid are leaving. Cornelia tests her revolver. Her niece Dale hired a gardener. Lizzie has fears about this house.<br /><br />Doctor Wells came by and offered advice to the two ladies. The new gardener arrives, he talks to Cornelia alone. We learn more about this gardener hired by Dale; he has a theory. Is there a secret room in this mansion? Dale call Richard Fleming at the country club. The electricity went out, the rooms are dark except for a candle. Can Dale get information from Fleming? There is conflict, then a single shot! The others rush to this spot. The house telephone rings but they are all here (Chapter 9)! Doctor Wells returned. The house telephone rings again but nobody’s there (Chapter 11)! Then a stranger enters the house. Reginald Beresford’s car broke down, he is looking for a telephone (he says). Dale tells of the change in Fleming when he imagined he could find the missing money. Could someone secretly enter the house?<br /><br />Cornelia wasn’t fooled by Brooks the gardener; she saw a photograph (Chapter 13). The detective found no one outside. Lizzie saw a bloody hand by the French window and shrieked! Where is that missing blueprint (Chapter 14)? Cornelia shows the doctor’s prescription. Later Beresford recognizes the gardener, who speaks up. Then Doctor Wells returns. There is a physical conflict over a scrap of paper! A hammering on the door of the terrace revealed an unknown man in muddied garments! This unconscious man can’t speak.<br /><br />They find the doors locked and the lights go out (Chapter 15)! Cornelia finds a hidden room and an empty safe in the attic. Alone in the dark Dale senses the presence of another person. The Bat? The others show up (Chapter 17). The Unknown man can’t remember much, his papers and watch are gone. Has the money disappeared from its hiding place (Chapter 19)? What surprise will they find in a locked closet? Will it solve this mystery? Will a burning garage distract them? Will that unknown man regain his consciousness? Will they catch “the Bat” when he returns for any stolen money? Will there be a happy ending after the theft and murders are solved? Chapter 21 ties up the loose ends.<br /><br />Rinehart has been compared to Agatha Christie, who first gained fame with her novel “The Murder of Roger Ackroyd” (which also has an unexpected ending). [I got a hint earlier in the book as to the identity of “the Bat”.] This story moves along quickly. Would it translate into a movie without changes? No. The story of a failed bank in 1926 is a warning of the coming Great Depression (which later caused the Stock Market Crash of 1929, and not the reverse). Some factories were shut down in 1927 due to a loss in sales. Note the freedom to keep and bear arms then. This story tells about the culture of that era."
513,5,"Richard Susskind's latest book makes for compelling reading for all those concerned with the future of legal services, Easy to read, this book is hard to put down. Recommended."
514,5,It was more than what I expected. A great book of its type and delivery was prompt and safe.<br />A reproduction of Hogarth artwork in this comic form and very suitable for all fans of both Hogarth and Tarzan comics.
515,5,I love this series and read each new book as it comes out. Alexander McCall Smith is a unique writer.
516,5,"Wonderful book!  A great way to teach children (and adults) about former South African president, Nelson Mandela, while also providing an overview of the historical and contemporary South Africa."
517,5,"Darcy Pattison here provides writers, both experienced and beginning, with an inspiring and practical guide to revisioning, not just tweaking, their completed work to make it the best it can be. Everyone I know who has used Pattison's approach praises it; many have gone on to publication and some to award recognition. Highly recommended."
518,5,"I read Dr. Dyer's book &#34;Your Erroneous Zones&#34; years ago when it first came out.  I still remember and live by his words to this day.<br /><br />This new book makes so much sense when you stop to think about what he is saying.  Of course, there are things in our lives that happen that we have no control over, but much of it we do.  This book is empowering to me.  I will read it a couple times a year to remind myself to stay strong."
519,4,"Ok, this series is getting seriously steamy! Erin & Devon are the epitome of young love! Can't wait to see what happens next in their story!! Hopefully all of their wishes to be together come true!!"
520,5,"I love Mark Sullivan/James Patterson's &#34;Private&#34; series. They are quick reads and great brain candy.  James Patterson has a few really good authors that write for him, Mark Sullivan is one of them."
521,4,Good practical advice and visual aids to reinforce the ideas.  Read and watch both as they compliment each other. Recommended.
522,5,"In Looking for Lynne, John L. Moore clearly establishes himself as all three and a writer who reaches out quickly to grab the hearts of his readers.  His development of his principal characters, their personalities, their strengths and their weaknesses are unsurpassed.  As a reader you get to know them.  Loving most, concerned for some and despising others.  John is a true lifelong cowboy who dearly loves the bad lands of Eastern Montana and the culture that surrounds the life of a cattle rancher he has known all of his life.  His descriptions of his surroundings is truly poetry in action and paints a vivid look at the beauty of the land that he so loves.  He makes a superb presentation of the relationship between a cowboy and his horse that brings the mythology of that relationship into a reality that still exists today.  If you enjoy tasteful good humor when you are reading than you will find it here with abundance.  Also If you enjoy reading books that grip you from the get go than this is also is a book for you for it firmly put a grip on my heart.  Looking for Lynne is a gem that should appeal to a very wide and diverse audience.<br /><br />Strongly recommended!"
523,5,"Yet another Fine book here by &#34;industrial archeologist&#34; Chuck Penson, author of the Heathkit Amateur Radio Equipment book. Well illustrated, every single piece of radio/Tv/audio test gear shown, with specs, prices, model changes, etc.Every meter, every sig gen, every scope (except the 4 channel audio scope!) Also a brief chapter with full schemos on the 2 early tube type analog computers!<br /><br /> Chuck has also consulted other serious Heath test gear collectors for some good technical info. No automotive test gear is included.Should be cheek-by-jowl with your Heathkit catalogs and his other Ham Radio book. Keep it handy when you go hamfesting, swapmeeting, flea market/garage sale/junk hunting.<br /><br />Well worth the very reasonabe price. I cant imagine the work it mustve taken-thanks, Chuck!<br /><br />(PS, Chuck:howzabouta Heath hi-fi book next???)<br /><br />Mike Zuccaro<br />AG6MQ<br />San Diego, CA"
524,5,These maps help you in doing tracking with your dog.  It gives you courses to help you improve your skills with your dog
525,4,My kids ages 11 and 14 really liked this book. They want to read more of the series. I'm glad it's appropriate for both ages.
526,5,"I find childrens' books to be charming.  When I saw &#34;Chloe&#34; in the local library, I borrowed it because my grandchildren, ages 6 and 9 were coming to visit.  I read it first.  What wonderful drawings!  And the humor fit for adults and kids.  The grandchildren were smitten with the book, so of course, I bought a copy for them to donate to their school library.  For now, though, they don't want to give it up."
527,5,Used this in a men's bible study. Very happy and satisfied with it. Written on a level for all to understand. Would recommend a group viewing of the movie before starting the study.
528,5,"I have read a lot of books about starting my own business in the last 5 months and this book is by far the most knowledgeable one and to the point. Everything that I had been thinking about doing is in this book the only difference is that I never looked at my current job as Paid Training. It has given me the confidence that I needed to move forward with my plan.<br />I would definitely recommend this book to anyone that is looking to start their own business! If you're looking for something that's not sugar coated and puts things in perspective, look no further... This is your book!"
529,4,Very helpful. For older learners<br />the letters need to be a little larger and use colors that draw your eyes to them.
530,4,The &#34;Power Girl: Power Trip&#34; comic compliation is one of the most awesome books I loved. I'm a huge fan of superhero comics and fun especially DC Comics and have been a big fan of these since I was young.
531,5,so sweet to be used to help decorate nursery. My niece expecting baby girl & has always been a collector of fairy things
532,4,tough read
533,5,"I don’t get a lot of opportunity to read lately, but this book was well worth my time.  I found myself looking forward to sitting down with the author to see what adventures were coming next.  But it was the familiar adventures that I could relate to on some level that kept me coming back.  The joy of small successes, the fear of being found out when I’m in over my head, nerves and optimism all wrapped up together.  I got swept up in the successes and heartache that make up any real journey.  The exotic locale and especially the culture with all its foreign quirkiness made it feel like an escape from my everyday life.  There were times she made me laugh out loud at the awkwardness created by the contrast of cultures.  The honesty and vulnerability the author shares makes her so human, like she could be my neighbor.  The formal plant names inserted were a distraction for me, not being versed or that interested in tropical plants.  But it obviously stems from the authors formal training and purpose for being in Panama, so I get the relation.  After a few chapters I found myself just skipping over them.  Finally, I would have loved some photos of the people and places described in the pages.  I’m hoping the next edition will include these.  Overall, a great read worth your time!"
534,5,"I received this book and had to force myself to stop reading it or I would miss work.  Well written and fast pace.  There is one unsolved mystery of three girls missing since 1966 and how they have never been found, let alone not intertwine with other killings in this book is beyond me.  Sad that money has greased so many palms in the Chicago PD that too many threads are left dangling."
535,5,great designs in the book. It has great ideas with color pictures.  a good tool to use in quilting and blocks
536,5,"Just what every knitter needs, I laughed along with Stephanie and enjoyed her insights into the knitters mind.  This is one I'll read again and again."
537,5,my children love this book.  it is fun to read and they laugh and are very engaged.  my 5 year old asks for it almost every day.
538,5,"Any Hardy Boys fan will enjoy The Sign Of The Crooked Arrow. It covers a lot of ground as the brothers travel to New Mexico to solve a mystery at their aunt's ranch. Very easy to read, and hard to put down."
539,5,"Barbara Marx Hubbard describes her spirituality as &#34;Evolutionary Spirituality.&#34; If you like her work, or if you're aware of and interested in &#34;Awakening&#34; or &#34;Ascension,&#34; you might find this book inspiring and satisfying. In her usual reader-friendly style, the author shares her personal experience in transcending the ego to a more expansive and universal state of awareness. She describes and &#34;labels&#34; her personal experience with the intention of enabling readers to understand how they too might achieve &#34;emergence.&#34; This book changed my own perception of the author from essentially one of &#34;futurist&#34; to one of a spiritually wise woman, an advanced soul."
540,4,"Fun book.  Helen and Colt have been friends for most of their lives.  Helen has also had a bit of a crush on him.  One night their friendship goes a little further and Helen ends up pregnant.  Kids haven't been in her plan for the immediate future as she concentrates on her rodeo career.  Colt is stunned to find out that Helen is pregnant with his baby.  As the single father of three boys he had not wanted any more children, but he's not going to walk away from Helen.  Can he convince her to give them a chance?<br /><br />Helen has always been focused on her rodeo career and her dream of a national championship.  Finding out she's pregnant puts those dreams on hold.  She's really nervous because she's never really been involved with taking care of kids and feels completely unprepared.  With this being Colt's baby, she fully expects that it's another boy and will be just like the three he has - really wild.  Colt starts pushing for them to get married, but Helen doesn't want him to marry her because it's the &#34;right&#34; thing to do, she wants love.  She also tries very hard to maintain her independence even though she likes being able to lean on Colt.  She likes being around his boys but she worries about whether she could really be a good mother for them.  It was fun to see her interact with them.  She also has a dream for her post rodeo life, but it seems to be in direct conflict with what Colt wants.  Some of that conflict could have been lessened if she and Colt had actually spent some time talking and listening to each other.<br /><br />Colt lost his wife when his third son was born.  The boys are pretty wild and he knows that he should be looking for a wife who can help him with them.  Problem is, ever since that night with Helen she's all he can really think about.  He'd love to get her in his life permanently, but he doesn't see her giving up her rodeo life any time soon.  I loved his happiness when she gave up her competing, but he was shocked when he found out why.  He was so very protective of her because of how he lost his wife that he was kind of smothering her.  Colt also had a lot of responsibility running his family's potato ranch and that work put him in conflict with Helen and her dream for her future.  I loved seeing him try to reconcile both and the struggles that he went through before he realized what was most important to him.<br /><br />I loved the small town setting and how close and supportive people are with each other.  It was fun seeing both Colt and Helen try to work things out while dealing with the interference from family and friends.  I also loved Colt's three boys.  They all seemed to be pretty normal kids, getting into the kind of trouble that kids do."
541,4,my 9 y/o liked it.<br /><br />Nothing objectionable that i can see.<br /><br />The illustrations are perfect for the genre. reminds me of danny and the dinosaur.
542,5,i just had a bit of nostalgia and remembered this book.  I got it when i was in elemantary school and i would read it over and over again. I would read it too my little brother to and he got a kick out of it. This book was so funny and soo good that now at 20 and in college i'm going to repurchase it and read it all over again. truly a hidden gem of childrens books :)
543,5,I LOVE IT I USE  ALL THE TIME. IT  IS  ONE OF MY COOKING BOOKS WE USE IN CLASS. I HATE EBOOKS I RADER HAVE A HARDCOVER ANY DAY
544,4,"I know people like short (4-6 week) small group curriculum.  But in my opinion this was not good material to cram into 6 weeks.  It basically does two lessons each week.  And even though they are paired well and fit together fairly nicely, it's just too much.  I'm using it as a church curriculum/program over three months and I break it all up.  I'm basically designing my own curriculum around the book and using these videos from the small group plan (and some of the questions from the Participants Guide) in a Sunday school class as little supplements.  It works and I like the videos.  But I end up with most only being about 5 minutes, which does feel a little choppy.<br />Still Ortberg is great and the material is the best I know to introduce people to spiritual practices as  training tools to allow God to transform people toward to maturity.<br />I just don't know whether I would advise anyone to try to use the DVD and participant's guide &#34;as is&#34; for a 6 week small group curriculum."
545,5,ACCOUNTING FOR HOSPITALITY MANAGERS is a text designed to follow an introductory book; it is not designed for &#34;one who knows nothing about accounting&#34;. One should first.read a basic principles book such as HOTEL AND RESTAURANT ACCOUNTING. ACCOUNTING FOR HOSPITALITY MANAGERS then follows with advanced accounting principles with special emphasis on financial management.
546,5,I bought this book for my brother in law and he said he loves it.  I looked through it before I gave it to him and it seemed like a great book.  It also explains everything you need to know about food.
547,5,"If you've never read Sandford, you are missing two of the most interesting characters in cop/action stories. Storm Front features Virgil Flowers, and there several others with him, and many more in the Prey series with Lucas Davenport. Anyway, I have been looking for this book for a while, and finally found it at Amazon. I didn't realize it had to come from England, so it took longer than I thought, but not more than could be expected, to get it.<br /> Think of a small town minister's son as a detective working for the state of Minnesota in its' rural areas, and the effect that his experiences have had on his point of view. He loves women, fishing, and catching the bad guys. He is like a pit bull with it's jaws clinched, he just doesn't stop. Watch out for when he thinks &#34;Huh.&#34; You may have missed something important!"
548,5,"Butchering Beef: The Comprehensive Photographic Guide to Humane Slaughtering and Butchering by Adam Danforth is a book I’d been looking forward to reading since I learned of its existence – which hasn’t been that long, only a few months now. One of the big attractions of the farming life for me is to be able to grow my own food. And considering I am a human a large part of my diet comes from animal meat and fat. Sorry vegans I prefer feeding my body what nature has designed it to consume to function optimally. So along with growing my own vegetables this means raising my own meat and knowing how to harvest it in the most humane way possible, and of course process the meat with as little waste and efficiency as I can. In addition I am interested in the direct marketing of the animals I’ll be raising so if I’m standing at a farmer’s market selling meat from animals I raised I should be able to explain to my customers what part of the animal particular cuts of meat came from and be able to explain the processing of the animal. This book focuses on beef, and Danforth has another book (soon to be reviewed) that focuses on smaller animals such as pigs, sheep, and chickens. The book is loaded with information and beautiful photography giving step by step directions for the entire process from slaughter to wrapping of the individual steaks. It’s a fantastic reference guide for any farmer or anyone who simply wants to understand more about the meat they’re eating and how it’s processed.<br /><br />What’s in the Book?<br /><br />The book is organized into 8 chapters. Chapter 1 From Muscle to Meat gives a detailed walk through with illustrations covering muscle structure, collagen, fats, proper storage, aging, and more. Chapter 2 Food Safety breaks down the various types of pathogens and bacteria commonly found in or around meat, how to avoid contamination, and proper cleaning and hygienic practices when butchering. Chapter 3 Tools and Equipment gives the reader a detailed explanation of the tools needed and why they’re needed. It covers knives, tabletop equipment, clothing, and other optional equipment. Chapter 4 Butchering Methods covers topics like knife grip, bone sawing, honing rod usage, trimming, boning, tenderization, portioning, and making knots (with butcher twine). Chapter 5 Pre-Slaughter Conditions & General Slaughter Techniques details everything from the day before the slaughter to stunning options, exsanguination, hoisting, skinning, evisceration, edible offal, carcass cooling, cleanup and disposal, and tools and space. Chapter 6 Slaughtering Cattle goes into the specific detail of how to slaughter. It starts with set up, then goes on to cover the stun, bleeding, skinning, hanging, and removal of offal, all with great attention to detail. Chapter 7 Beef Butchering goes into great detail with beautiful photography how to break down a side of beef starting with the primals and going into subprimals. Chapter 8 Packaging and Freezing covers freezing options and best practices along with packaging and best practices.<br /><br />Highlights<br />It’s hard to choose highlights in this book, but I think the photography and step by step primal and subprimal breakdowns sections in chapter 7 are really what make this such a fantastic reference book.<br /><br />Final Thoughts of a Wannabe Farmer<br />Adam Danforth has done a fantastic job in creating a comprehensive guide to Beef butchering. There is no substitute for doing, but before one can do or should do it’s certainly wise to take a look at the blueprints.

There is no substitute for doing, but before one can do or should do it’s certainly wise to take a look at the blueprints. This book lays every step out in an a very accessible way, and the supplemental details about muscle structure, tools, cleaning, etc. round the book out to make a complete reference guide that should last a lifetime."
549,5,My kid loved it! So much fun ! He cant get enough of mad libs!!! Very satisfied with my purchase !
550,5,"A good read, and Card surprises me by how much he builds his characters and this story around the struggle for human rights."
551,5,"Well written, positive and many ways to improve oneself particularly spiritually.  Matthew is a very inspirational speaker and motivator.  I like his audio books also."
552,5,"I gave the rating 5 stars because besides being happy I was able to get four of these books, they were simple to order & they arrived so quickly I hadn't even started thinking about watching for them to arrive yet."
553,3,"I think the premise of this book is a good one. Everyone needs forgiveness and I think it is very true that forgiveness is a gift that you give yourself. This book, like the others of Iyanla’s that I have read, require a commitment to introspection and journaling. It is not a book to sit and read in one sitting, but rather one that you must commit to for 21 days. I have a seriously short attention span, so I did not get past the first several days. However, I think this is a great book with great exercises for someone who is committed to the concept and believes in tapping. I think the commitment, in conjunction with the tapping, is what made this a difficult book for me to embrace. Tapping is essentially needle-free acupuncture and I found it to be pretty hokey. If you feel differently and can commit to 21 days, then this is the forgiveness book for you."
554,4,"This is a book to get lost in. From the first page..the first sentence, even..you are drawn into an entire new world. &#34;Are you ready, Ashling, my love?&#34; that is first sentence and I was instantly right there along with Ashling wondering where we were going and how it would go, and that is a magical quality for a book to have.<br /><br />  There is a lot to this story, it's really quite amazing. It starts with Ashling yearning to be accepted by her father and dying to meet her pack. She's been kept away because special abilities make her some people view her as a threat, but it is finally time for her to come out and see the world. Through the book we see her grow from this headstrong child who is longing for approval, to a young woman who has seen and done so much.<br /><br />  My favorite part of this novel was the world. The traditions and laws of the werewolf society were amazing. The details were impeccable and it really made the fantasy side of this novel feel extremely believable. Also, the Author's description of the different environments really pull you straight into every scene; there is the perfect amount of detail so that it is intriguing instead of overwhelming. From ancient castles to a modern high school, you're with her through it all.<br /><br />  The romance is a major part of the story line. And, it is an insta-love situation. I do not like those. So, the beginning of the romance I spent a decent amount of time rolling my eyes; but after I got past my disdain, I could really buy the romance. I like how even though it is teenagers there is a lot of reliance on each other, and for the most part it is fairly healthy. Also, it's extremely swoon worthy. Like, extremely.<br /><br /> It's very interesting because the werewolves are meant to protect humans, so Ashling has this protective streak in her for all of the people around her. So, when you're reading scenes where she is with human friends you really get the sense of her other-worldliness and that was lovely. LOVELY.<br /><br />  The relationship between her and her mother, her and her favorite brother, and her and her caretaker are all beautiful! And, the ending. Whoa. The ending is perfect. The ending makes me very angry that I cannot get the second book tomorrow!! It brings the series to another level entirely and I cannot wait to see the way this series grows!<br /><br />  This is not a perfect novel. The writing is not the best, you will find inconsistencies, the romance can be far-fetched, and some of the characters feel like card-board cut-outs. So, i'm going to say this- Allow yourself to get lost in this novel. Curl up inside of it and breathe it in deeply. Look to it for enjoyment, don't criticize it. You can find things to criticize, but you'd be robbing yourself of an awesome story.<br /><br /> In short:<br /><br />Cover-9/10<br /><br />Writing-5/10<br /><br />Characters-7/10<br /><br />Pace-7/10<br /><br />Plot-7/10<br /><br />Originality-8/10<br /><br />Overall-4/5<br /><br />Content-<br />Language-Mild-In all honesty, I don't remember. But, I would remember if it was bad, and I just flipped through and couldn't find any.<br /><br />Violence- Moderate- the expected amount for the genre. There is fighting, some deaths, and some werewolf fights. Yeah, it's awesome .<br /><br />Sexual Content-Moderate- A lot of making out, there is a conversation about waiting to have sex, some other random comments, and talk of desire.<br /><br />Quote<br /><br />&#34;Our love transcend space and time. No culture or creed could ever keep us apart. Even death is just the beginning&#34;"
555,5,"The poems are so relevant that almost everyone can relate to at least one poem in the book. The author paints a picture through words. If you are a spiritual person you can be encouraged. If you are not a spiritual person, you can still take valuable lessons from each poem. I love It!"
556,5,"Best one so far ,and the ending just made it better . Tight how It came together . Just pre ordered illuminati : round table of bosses"
557,5,"I. Enjoyed this book very much. I would like it to be longer and more detailed, but loved and can't wait for the next book in the series...."
558,4,"The info was good, but the story was shorter than I expected.  I would have liked a little longer story with more details.  It may work well for some young children, especially if the family is new to prepping, but was too simplistic for my 9 year old son (who reads at the highschool or college level).  In many ways my son has the comprehension of a much older child, so I have a hard time judging for a more average child of similar age."
559,5,"Love this book. Simple example of recovery, faith , hope. Helps one work their way through inner struggles. A subject for many issues that face each of us, answers and guidance from the bible. Inspirational!"
560,1,"A coloring book?  What's wrong with simple, direct black and white?  Good honest lines?  Adding color here is much too liberal an idea to pass along to children.  Do they think that life will be colorful?  Why lie to them?  No, this book is clearly a liberal plot to indoctrinate our children into seeing a world filled with color and shades of meaning instead of plain old Right and Wrong.<br /><br />And then come the rainbows.  You know what that means.  Oh yes you do.  It's The Agenda.<br /><br />Save our children.  Do NOT buy this book.  It's the work of Satan."
561,4,"This book began slowly and annoyingly. At one point I put it down and started to pick up another book, then though I'd give it a few more minutes. And I'm glad I did, because I ended up liking it quite a bit.<br /><br />The book is one in a series about private detectives Paul Chang and Nelson Davis. Both are former NYPD and Delaware police officers, so they have extensive experience in law enforcement and friends across the respective agencies. Both detectives were interesting, and I will have to read previous books (which I will) to see how they ended up in their current situations. There was more character development of Paul Chang than Nelson Davis, and hopefully a future book will give more insight into Nelson's personality and character. As the book progressed though, more and more was revealed about each, making them feel like whole people.<br /><br />I wasn't as fond of their client, Laura Stark, a TV newswoman, and her current boyfriend Drew. They were well developed characters for the most part, they just didn't appeal to me. The secondary characters are also well developed and evolve and change as the story develops<br /><br />The antagonist is the clown of the title, Laura Stark's ex-husband who grew up in a circus environment and is proficient at disguises and all manner of subterfuge. Without giving away the plot (probably well discussed by other reviewers) Max Stark is often a step ahead of the police and the detectives, making him seem unstoppable.<br /><br />It's an exciting story with an exciting denouement. Once the story got rolling, it because more and more difficult to lay the book down (it was 4:02am when I finished it. Thank goodness I didn't have to go to work today).  I wholeheartedly recommend this book by Gregory Smith, and I look forward to reading his past and future stories about Mr. Chang and Mr. Davis."
562,5,"Lisa expresses what every grieving mother is feeling - the shock, sadness, anger and love for our missing child.  How she does this so early in her grief is amazing. This is a perfect book to give any grieving parent - we all need to know our feelings are real and we aren't alone in our grief. Lisa's book does this!  We all hate being a part of this group of grieving parents, but there is comfort and peace found in Lisa's poems."
563,4,"As an archaeologist, I am often required to identify indigenous and invasive species of plants. Not being familiar with every grass and shrub I come across, this book serves me well in identifying those plants and distinguishing between what is native and non-native. The authors also include interesting anecdotes, regarding historic and prehistoric use, about some of the more prevalent plants found."
564,5,"I am grateful to Pat Morgan for providing insight and value to these persons we each pass on the streets and on most corners in every city . I will never look at them in the same way again. She is a modern day Mother Teresa ! Seriously her dedication and love for the most vulnerable in our society is admirable. I learned so much of what goes on in the &#34;system&#34; , the politics and the need . Thank you for placing value and brining dignity to a much misinterpreted people."
565,5,"Great story line, this book is so addictive! Javetta and Derrick's minds are intriguing. Simply put just a wonderful book."
566,5,"190 pages, copious B&W photos and diagrams, with a nice bibliography and suggested reading list at the end, written competently and in a conversational style.  Not a sourcebook for the whys and wheretofors of gear geometry, but an excellent guide on cutting gears in different profiles using a traditional watchmakers lathe and milling attachment.  Process and various set-ups are clearly described and illustrated.  A shop-made dividing attachment for the lathe headstock, and a few other exceedingly useful jigs and tools are drawn and their use are explained.  The book concludes with the design and construction of a relatively simple weight driven pendulum clock as a project to tie everything together.  As is so often the case, measurements are a mixed bag: wire gauge round stock, sheet stock made to standard thickness, and dimensions in metric--frequently the metric conversion of a fractional inch distance. But hey, if it were easy...<br /><br />I personally think this book worth much more than the two separate volumes &#34;Dividing&#34; and &#34;Gears & Gear Cutting&#34;, by Harold Hall and Ivan Law respectively, from the Workshop Practice series.  While the other two are somewhat more broad in scope and cover more theory (the whys and wheretofors, but if that is what you are after, then, &#34;The Machinery's Handbook&#34; from Industrial Press leaves them both *far* behind, covering a vastly larger number of topics in greater depth), they do not do near as a good a job of explaining how to actually make something, how to actually cut and shape gears and gear cutters--particularly small ones--or construct and use a dividing machine, as does this one book."
567,5,This series is great  You won't be able to put it down and will want to start the next book immediately.  Stays to the story line and the same characters are throughout the whole series
568,4,"This book was fantastic, especially if you just turned 60 and wonder what to do with your life. The main character was very likable and the whole thing was a fun experience. Quindlen is such a good writer!"
569,5,My 17 year old did this study like a personal devotional. A great choice for men and teens into sports. A great look at God.
570,5,I would highly recommend this book.  It shows that that the author put a lot of time and energy to research this project and his writing is excellent.
571,5,"what a great item and if you had the opportunity to see these guys in 2000 even better, many many thanks"
572,2,"Yes, this is a nice, easy, cheerful read.  The overall philosophy of the book makes sense--having a good attitude will help.  My hesitancy with the book is that it is being used as a tool of upper management to criticize lower level employees without those in upper management actually taking responsibility for the problems that are most likely causing the bad attitudes in the first place.  If you've ever worked for a horrible boss, having a good attitude will only get you so far.  Not to mention the huge burden being placed on the employee to rally themselves every day to have a good attitude and provide excellent service and what have you while receiving little support from their leaders. It's all about leadership.  If the leadership initiated this philosophy by first going to the employees and seeing what problems they had--the employees would most likely respond.  It's all about leadership--leaders creating a good environment to work in and valuing the concerns and opinions of the employees will really make an institutional difference."
573,5,"Great for little girls. My daughter loves it, the only problem that I have now is that my house is completely cover of hello kitty stickers"
574,5,"Simply said, I just love how Dakota Madison writes and this story is now my favorite. Perhaps I could relate so well being a former English teacher, reading wonderful Shakespeare quotes and a sweet, lovely romance we all wish we can experience.. How can that be beat? What I love most is what I call the visual writing aspect. The choice of words the author uses makes you not only feel you are there as a bystander with the characters but see and feel their emotions as well. Writing doesn't get better than that. Truly a delightful read."
575,5,We got this book almost 15 years ago and lost it. It has many amazing recipes that are not in the newer versions.
576,5,This book was only 15 bucks and required for more course so purchasing it was a no brainer.  It was shipped quickly as well.
577,5,This is a great product and well worth the money!!! It was packaged well and shipped quickly!!! My husband is learning a great deal from it.
578,4,"I have read the book The Giver before and i enjoyed that book a lot! Anthem was very close to the same layout and plot as The Giver. Anthem is a short book, and its a very easy read. I'm not a big reader but there are those books that make you happy you read them, and this book was one of those. Part that i liked the most about the book was the detail. The way that the author wrote the story and the words that she used put you right in the story.The book only took me about 3 hours to read and it was worth every minute. The only thing bad i would have to say about the book is that the characters don't use words like him, she, i , you. In doing this it makes it a little harder to read and understand who they are talking about, but the way they talk is a important part of the story. The book is also clean, so i think that i would recommend it to anyone that enjoys to read."
579,5,"My grandson loves this book. The pictures are delightful. There are two levels of dialogue so he can enjoy being read to or read parts of it himself.  The theme of a little guy triumphing over bigger, stronger guys is perfect for a young child."
580,5,Love this book! It's a perfect Alaskan book to read to little ones!! I would recommend it highly for all ages!
581,4,"The book was informative,but there were to many examples given for each heading and subheading. The test and summary at the end of each chapter is helpful."
582,5,"Alinka Rutkowska has the ability to write delightful humorous books with fun illustrations by Konrad Checinski. She has won the “Readers’ Favorite Five Stars.” This is one of nine books in which the two show brother and sister Maya and Filippo exploring the world and learning while they are doing so. Unfortunately most American children know little about the world outside of the US and even know little about their own country. Children will enjoy the Rutkowska stories and will learn about the world outside of the United States, begin to become interested in their own country, and learn how to behave.<br /><br />In this fun 28 page tale, Maya and Filippo are on their family ship “Fun Princess” with their parents and some other kids. Since they love learning about how things work they decide to go to the ship’s chef with the other kids on their ship and learn how to make cakes. Two episodes nearly ruin their experience: one of the kids is grumbling and both Maya and Filippo want to use an orange, but there is only one left.<br /><br />Reading this story, children will learn about how to have fun and how to share, and they will do so while enjoying a humorous tale."
583,3,"I read so many mysteries sometimes they all seem to sound the same. A little different in that it was set in a museum, but much like all mysteries."
584,5,I do communion meditations and fill in for our Pastor once in awhile. There is a four page study of each book plus extra studies on Psalms. There is also an outline and application section. Great study material and sermon starter.
585,5,This volume comprises of three original stories from Blake's 7 read by Gareth Thomas (Blake).  A must have for any Blake's 7 fan.
586,5,"Seekers of the Lost Boy is an engaging, educational, thought-provoking tale that will capture the interest of children regardless of culture.  I read it for my three kids, ages 6, 8 and 11 and they pleaded with me to keep reading at the end of every chapter.  I also wrote a more complete review, which was published here: [...]"
587,5,I was totally unprepared for my diagnosis and was looking for something informative on what to expect.  This book does that and more.  I feel much better going into the chemo treatments now.  THANK YOU!
588,5,"This book is one that really makes you think about what you’re putting into your body when you go to a fast food restaurant, and what price you are paying for it.  Fast food has become a ubiquitous part of American (and worldwide) culture.  As kids, my sister and I went to McDonald’s every Saturday for a Happy Meal, which we regarded as a special treat.  Somewhere along the way, we got more concerned about calories and nutrition.  She doesn’t eat fast food at all, and I stopped eating fast food for the most part too except for French fries.  As the author also notes, there is just something almost addictive about McDonald’s French fries, especially when they’re hot out of the fryer.<br /><br />That being said, the problem with our love affair with fast food is much larger than just the concern about obesity, calories and nutrition.  It’s also an issue of homogenization, of form over substance, of a throwaway culture that is insistent on always having it your way.  It’s easy for us to emphasize convenience to the point that a lot of other important values like economic justice and a minimum concern for the welfare of society’s least fortunate members can get left by the wayside.  In addition, whether you are a vegetarian or a meat-eater, it is hard to argue against the idea that animals should be slaughtered in a humane way that causes them the least amount of suffering possible.<br /><br />In spite of all his negative findings about the fast food industry (and the meatpacking and agribusiness industries that support it), the author ends on an optimistic note about the ability of consumers to put economic pressure on fast food companies to change for the better.  Basically it comes down to the fact that they will sell whatever we will buy.  I’m not going to avoid all fast food restaurants like the plague after reading this book, but I certainly will think twice about what I purchase there, particularly the entrees."
589,3,"I was very excited to read this novel by Elizabeth Strout, as I felt that &#34;Olive Kittridge&#34; was a truly fantastic novel. However, I thought this book was decent but lacked excitement. Strout is a superstar in penning beautiful novels and she has a knack for sentence construction that makes you sit back and go, &#34;wow. that was stunning&#34;. However, what has worked for her in past novels (simple, self-victimized characters) failed her this time.<br /><br />In &#34;Olive Kittridge&#34; the readers felt something for Olive. It wasn't always positive but she still evoked emotion. Amy and Isabelle doesn't do that. They are not only unrelateable, they are not even likeable. I was waiting for this book to take that step from crawling to standing up on it's own two feet and walking, but it never happened. The plot fell flat, and the characters failed in evoking a reaction from the reader.<br /><br />Though beautifully written it was not Strout's best work. Though, as a debut novel one can argue that it stands as a perfect example of getting better with age."
590,5,"Engineers are \\""into\\"" cycles every day (AC signals, Fourier Transforms, etc) and to read how David has now pulled together the data to show so much evidence that our history itself is a series of repeating cycles -- wow"
591,3,"This calendar is nice enough...but its very busy with mediocre pictures and disappointing jokes.  It leaves cramped space for notes, so if you're like me and need space for day to day reminders, appointments, etc. I would not recommend this calendar.  I already bought a new one!"
592,5,"Very amusing, cute, well written and relatable to children (and adults too). My  3 year old loves this book as well as others by David Shannon."
593,5,"Corporate Learning is indeed big business these days!<br /> This book, based on extensive research and experience, is very well written and covers - with authority - all facets of the learning process in large organizations.<br /> The author demonstrates vast hands-on knowledge of this complex field and structures the book carefully and intelligently.<br />It is a must read book for those in charge of corporate learning and also for the business leaders that found themselves at the receiving end of the teachings."
594,5,"Fun,adventure ,and romance.completely enjoyable. I stayed up until the wee hours of the morning devouring this exciting book. A definite great read."
595,5,"The authors present four views of the millennium which have been debated for centuries.<br />Pros:<br />The authors are knowledgeable, understandable, and generally kind to the opposing positions.<br />The format is amazing - each author presents his view and each author responds to each of the others' presentations.<br /><br />Cons:<br />It would be helpful to know the basic points of each view before reading, as the authors focus more on debating and less on explaining."
596,5,"I purchased this book for a friend's birthday - he absolutely loved it. Particularly fond of Porsches, I knew that he would appreciate the content - the evolution of the Porsche is greatly detailed as you progress through the book, beautiful imagery coupled with informative text will oblige any car lover. This makes for a great coffee table book or go-to-guide if you need to reference a specific year."
597,4,This is a book to explain life after death to the beginner.  If you are an advanced student of life after death issues then you will be disappointed with this book.  But if you are a beginning student this explains the basics clearly and concisely in story form.  It is a easy read and can be completed in a short period of time.  It would probably be great for the bereaved of a loved one who as passed on.
598,5,"The Once and Future King ended, or rather stopped at an awkward point. T.H. White was having difficulties with his passivist and non-violent proclivities and the madness that was WWII. He exiled himself to Ireland to avoid the war and then found that the Irish viewed him as an outsider and peculiar to boot. He found the Irish coarse, ill mannered and violent, which explains many of the charatcters in both books. In the end, Arthur must make a choice and Merlin must help him to make it. The high and low comedy that accompanies this process and the unutterable sorrow that all, all of the characters must endure to bring this about is both the pain and the reward of this read. You don't have to know about White's struggles with his conscience to appreciate these two books, but it does inform the reading and it makes Arthur's and Merln's pain that much more poignant. Prepare to weep for Arthur, Merlin, the Hedgehog and all of mankind."
599,5,"I have been using this logbook for years! I can easily keep track of many different activites in it, including my biking and yoga (under the columns across the top). You can choose what you want to use each column for. I even use a column for hours of sleep. I especially love the 3 lines to write in for each day. I use it for a mini-journal of other goings-on too. Far right column I use for periodic weight or B/P measurements. In fact this year, i ordered 3 of these so I am well-supplied in case I can't find them anymore. :-)"
600,5,My son just completed a 28 day inpatient rehab for gambling in Louisiana.  This workbook is a lot like what they did.  He is a changed man.  His life was out of control before and family was affected.  Please get help if your loved one has this problem.  Search on Internet for rehab places.  I do recommend Louisiana's. This book is good.  The workbook may seem simple but is effective.  This is a disease that needs treatment.  The compulsive gambler can not control themselves.  The gambling industry and our government needs to have more treatment readily available for people.  Get involved!
601,5,Used as business gift for European colleague.  Very representative on my home (Montana).  If you're seeking something more than a postcard with great pics and limited explanations - this is a good choice.
602,5,"What a character, that Grimaldus, why so serious?.  I picked up this book after reading the Armageddon omnibus from Black Library by Jonathon Green.  Grimaldus of the Black Templars is the tip of the spear in this novel, where Brandt was in Green's.  Both characters are and have to be different and the two authors do portray the Black Templars also with minor differences, I wouldn't go as far as to say they are totally different.  So if you read Green's Armageddon story line, I recommend Dembski-Bowden's as well.  The background story and setting for each Armageddon is true 40K; l luvs orcs.<br /><br />  It has been a little while since I read the book however, but this and the Armageddon omnibus are of those few I've set aside to read again, I did enjoy them that much.  I actually want to pick up some of the Armageddon e-books, if anybody recommends any, let me know.  For my part I'll throw in Yarrick: Chains of Golgotha to add to your collection along with this one, go buy it now!"
603,4,Learned a lot about the hotels in older New York. Wasn't what I was looking for but appreciate the work that went into this book.
604,5,So this is my second time screwing up as this book looks like its a standard issue to classrooms and the first book I got that was similar to this was &#34;All Quite on the Western Front&#34; which again I would have searched for a different type of Hardcover for this book and again this con will not effect my star rating as this book is a very interesting read for sure!
605,4,"This has been a good read for me, but I think with the contents it shouldnt have cost so much. I would have loved to seen more personal work done by the artist in stages, but what she talks about is achievable for us all."
606,4,"This was such an enjoyable read and would be for anyone who grew up in Baltimore. If you can remember street cars, Christmas window displays in downtown stores, Read's Drug Stores, etc. you will have fun going down memory lane with this book!"
607,5,"I tend to like books that are more on the dark side, and don't have much of a thing for happy endings. If sad books make you feel bad, this might not be for you. It has a very depressing tone, and the main character's descent in life is mainly his own fault. To me, this book documents a more &#34;real&#34; interpretation of life: sometimes you get your hopes up, and then it seems like everything crumbles. Life is not always as harsh as this story, but it is very relatable."
608,4,"Simple, easy to use. There seems to be a dearth of ligatures, but for what it does offer, it's fine. A line of examples of characters if followed beneath that line with several lines for the student to practice. As with all such language books, I photocopy the pages and practice on the photocopies. Later, when review is needed, I use another photocopy rather than use up the book itself."
609,5,Exactly what I wanted.  It was great to find the pattern for my children's Christmas stockings stitched over 20 years ago-now their spouses will receive companion stockings!  Recommended to anyone who wants a classy stitched Christmas stocking.
610,3,"The story started out great,  with Jack Henry trying to find Larelyn. But as soon as they reunited I think the plot slowed down and there was no real direction to the story.  There were a lot of love scenes that I feel were a little repetative. I feel like the author spent most of the last part of the book setting up the plot for the final book in the series.  I did enjoy the story and will read the last book,  but it was not nearly as good as Beauty From Pain."
611,4,This book and all the rest are GREAT re-publishing of the original handbooks. My only dislike was that the rating system was not completely defined. Great otherwise
612,5,"I love that Violet is a little quirky and creative, we have suggested to all 6-9 year old friends in our lives."
613,3,"I knew that it wasn't a book full of stars from reading the reviews, so I knew what I was getting and it was fine for a stocking stuffer."
614,5,"\\""Prepared for a Purpose\\"" is written by Antoinette Tuff. This book is amazing. It's the story of an incredible woman who in the face of great difficulty, stood calm, relied on her faith and was able to keep her entire school safe from what could have been another deadly school shooting.    As 870 students remain on lock down, Antoinette is faced with Michael Hill, a intruder who enters the front of office and states \\"" were gonna die today.\\"" This book doesn't just begin here, it also begins with Antoinette facing her own pain as a child, her pain in her marriage and the rejection, hurt and despair she once felt.    This pain and journey allowed her to be courageous in the face of adversity and prepared her for a moment that nothing else could. My favorite quote from this Book:    I highly recommend this book. I read it cover to cover in two hours. It will grip you as you read the story of a woman who pours her heart out and faces extraordinary circumstances and saves the staff and students at Ronald E. McNair Discovery Learning Academy. As a school social worker, this book spoke to my heart in so many ways. Michael Hill is a human, who for whatever reason on that day had lots of anxiety, was clearly aggravated, had some mental health issues and needed someone to love and listen to him. I think we can learn a lot from Antoinette and the way she handled herself and her  personal life.    Thank you to Bethany House for allowing me to review this book. To find out more information on go to [...] You can currently find it on Amazon, Barnes& Nobles or any other fine retailers. I give this book five stars and will pass it on to my colleagues."
615,5,Absolutely riveting. I laughed and sobbed and remembered far more of my growing up years than I really wanted to.
616,5,"To all fans of Ann Rule, this book will not disappoint. Fast paced story which you will not be able to put down! 5 stars!"
617,3,"It was well written ... there were some engaging anecdotes ... however, several felt somehow unfinished, or at least I came away expecting more.  It was okay ... worth a read."
618,5,I thoroughly enjoyed this true story which confirmed for me why the bond between dogs and humans is so special. It was a book well worth reading.
619,5,"The author's conversational style makes this book a great one for the non-science reader.<br />It confirms the value of music and art in our schools--just as they're being eliminated!<br />It's a fascinating read for anyone, but I especially recommend it to those teaching children."
620,5,I own the essential course too.  Training material is very organized and easy to follow. Web development is very convoluted with multiple technologies. The author presents material in logical fashion and each lesson builds on the other. Each lesson builds confidence.  Highly recommend both books.
621,5,"This is a wonderful book, filled with great exercises, pictures, tips and instructions.  I love the layout of it as well.  I bought this for my son-in-law but am going to buy one for me as well."
622,5,"It is no surprise that the author of this book is an experienced writer of screenplays for both movies and television. It has everything needed for a Summer blockbuster inluding violence, the possibility of the deaths of millions of people if things don't turn out right, an authority fighting protagonist and a love interest. The plot is fast moving and exciting and there is never a dull moment in the almost 400 pages. The primary plot involves the threat of an all out shooting war between the United States and China which our hero must somehow avert. This is a great book by a great author. Put Drew Chapman on your radar."
623,5,"This text has excellent and interesting data for teachers and students to explore. While some of it is outdated (and I recommend another edition), teachers can easily explore the internet on a given topic to bring it up to date."
624,5,Very helpful for my son to use as a refresher before starting college.  He is happy with them and glad he ordered them.
625,5,"If you live or have lived in the Dayton area this book is a must read. It will make you think about the economic downturn in the region and how these fluctuation play into our current lives and the distant future.  The circle of politics, economics, and life are flashing across our minds as these players develope."
626,5,"Scott is an amazing mentor. This book is great for anyone looking to create a life of success and significance. Its a great book to help turn around the thinking of a business, organizations, and churches. Must read."
627,5,"Bought this book as a gift. It was greatly appreciated as the recipient loves craft beer and does a bit of his own brewing - and, did not have this book. He loves to cook so it will go to good use."
628,5,"I wish Tim Thayne's &#34;Not by Chance&#34; had been available when we realized three years ago that we were not going to be able to keep our daughter alive despite all of the support and therapy we could provide.  Although we were able to find excellent programs for her, Tim's book would have been a welcome supplement and an independent reassurance that we were doing the right thing, that the programs we had picked were doing a good job, of why and how we all needed to change, and of what to expect when she eventually came home.  His short, simple analogies were right on target to help me understand more clearly why some of the problems occurred.  His 'assignments' for parents were few but thought provoking and essential.  It is well written, well organized and easy to read, even for parents in the midst of turmoil.  I have written all of the caregivers we have used to recommend that they include this in their parent reading lists."
629,5,I have found through reading this book a deeper and stronger relationship in God and the word.  It was presented to me as a gift from my aunt who is above me spiritually and now geographically.  She is one who knows a good thing when she sees it and this book is no exception.  Shortly after receiving the book in the mail I began reading it and I have not missed a day yet. The messages both from scripture and from the author's perspective are very thought provoking and leave you with something positive to focus on throughout the day.  I have read the second half and cannot wait for the first.
630,5,I have purchased this book and CD several times and I always seem to loan it out knowing it wont be returned it is a good listen and learn book and the CD is a great bonus
631,5,For those that follow the band history is a must to have this book. I strongly recommend to buy this
632,5,Everything is very informative. Definitely should have a vocal coach with you to understand all of this. Great great great
633,5,I either get a calendar from Wyoming or Colorado. Helps with me living in eastern Washington. The beauty of Wyoming and Colorado are breathtaking.
634,5,"This textbook includes plenty of useful information regarding the basics of carpentry. Some of the things include: types of wood, types of nails, saws, blades, manufacture of wood, etc."
635,4,"I chose the rate this item four out of five stars because the item was easy to find on the site, allows different pricing and helps to see whether the item can be taken brand new or used."
636,5,"This is a great book. It's nice enough for a 'coffee table' book. It's a great book for ideas or to just look and it and admire all the beautiful works of art. If you like mixed media and the use of quotes, this is the book for you. I highly recommend it."
637,4,"I have 40 years experience in hospitality, but still found this book to be inspiring, idea provoking, relevant and easy to read. Well done to Wil Brawley and well worthwhile to read."
638,4,"These sticker books are quite small which make them perfect for throwing into your purse / diaper bag / glove compartment to keep the kids occupied on road trips, plane rides, sitting through mass, etc.  The staple is a bit of an issue for younger children but you can easily take them apart so they have 2 sheets (one with the scene, the other with the stickers)."
639,4,Great Christmas story - Charleston style.  Pearls of wisdom that each of us can learn from.  Really enjoyed and great read during the holidays.
640,3,"The book is well written and has a great story. However, the end is terrible. The author completely disregarded the audience she was writing to. That kind of ending DOES NOT appeal to a YA book!!!  Mrs. Roth missed the opportunity to establish herself as a writer who her readers would be eagerly looking for her next novel. They won’t. The disappointment was irreparable."
641,5,2 adult males received this book along with a smoker for food.  The book went over great with them both.
642,5,"I love the book to read and CD to listen.  Highly recommend to people who need some support, someone to talk to on different subjects of life.  &#34;I Can Do It&#34; is my favorite Louise Hay book and I listen to CD at least once per one - two week.  Always makes me feel good.  I highly recommend it to middle age woman (or older : ); it will make your life brighter, easier, happier."
643,5,"My 12 year old grandson, who lives in a rural town outside of NY,  thoroughly enjoyed this book, as did his grandmother who lives very near Central Park.  It's an upbeat story about two resourceful City kids with intelligence and imagination.  It's a wonderful window into city life and adult relationships."
644,4,"The selection of music is very good for church services, and the difficulty is fairly consistent. I'm still working on mastery of various pieces."
645,2,"I had enjoyed the pace and the banter and even the lightness of the previous volumes, so this conclusion came as a disappointment. I did not feel much connection with any of the characters, the exploration of the under-world by Harold was incredibly lengthy and required a major dose of belief suspension, (I have to acknowledge that I almost always find descriptions of other or earlier worlds in fantasy just unconvincing.)  The final battle was hurried and unconvincing, and the final twist in the plot (no spoiler!) was as unpleasant as an ankle twist! Not recommended."
646,4,"Elizabeth Kolbert is a highly touted and award winning journalist who has a passion for science.  Kolbert has been a staff writer for the New Yorker since 1999 as well as a reporter for the New York Times (Kolbert, 2006).  She decided to embark on a journey across the world to shed light on mans impact on the environment.  She travels and interviews scientist and locals to gain perspective on the reasoning behind the climate changes and the impact it has had on the community.  She consistently comes back to the idea of needing a global effort to combat climate, and she deduces that the United States needs to be more involved in situation.<br />Kolbert believes in order to combat climate change, global cooperation is needed.  She believed that more initiatives like the Kyoto Protocol, which was a pact to reduce global emissions and control greenhouse gases, needed to be taken.  The evidence is clear from a scientific standpoint and in real world application that the Earth is rising in temperature which has impacted the global climate.  Kolbert scolds the United States for not being involved in the Kyoto Protocol.  Global collaboration is inherent to the success of eliminating the negative effects of humans.  She does however commend the national powers on cooperating in the effort to eliminate Chloroflourocarbons from the atmosphere.  The various governments came together and had their scientists collaborate which made for more effective research.  She believes that humans have been able to adapt to their environment through their ingenuity.<br />With ingenuity people need to find ways to reduce emissions and clean up the atmosphere.  She claims that if the average global temperature increase only a few more degrees, that it will be the hottest it has ever since our species has evolved.  She continuously comes back to the idea of hope in that humans can get out of the mess they made by being resourceful.  Kolbert cautions the world to be careful with its response anddoes not want to see the human race put an end to itself, “It may seem impossible to imagine that a technologically advanced society could choose, in essence, to destroy itself, but that is what we are now in the process of doing” (Kolbert, 2006).  The lines quoted above are part of the last sentence in her book, and it shows her confidence but also her disappointment in the human race.  Humans have the capability to combat climate change, but the focus and the drive have to be present.  Organization and communication will help the world combat climate change before the effects become irreversible."
647,5,Ford shop manual is a neccessity if you own an old ford tractor like me. Use it all the time. Highly recommend this manual.
648,4,"Poorly edited, which offends me when I find it in any book from a serious publisher.  A reader needs just a little background (e.g. an introductory course in physics) to understand most of it, but a few short sections are more demanding."
649,5,"I was given this book over 30 years ago by a dear friend and it sparked a life long interest in calligraphy. Over the years, I've learned many other hands besides Italic and purchased many, many books and I can still say that this is the best learning and teaching guide I've ever used.<br /><br />Mr. Eager focuses on the letter shapes, which the student practices with felt tip pen until he/she has mastered the letter form. Then the fun begins! He teaches the student to write those same letters using a chisel tip pen (a calligraphy pen) and the results are magical. I've taught my own 7 children as well as many others throughout the years using this book and I've yet to meet a child who didn't beam with pleasure the first time he/she put calligraphy pen to paper.<br /><br />Mr. Eager goes further in teaching Italic cursive writing, a quick and beautiful cursive hand, in the last segment of the book. This is a hand that can be written quickly enough to use as ones every day handwriting. He has also wisely included many examples of Italic calligraphy pieces to inspire the student to create their own calligraphic works of art.<br /><br />This book is designed as a workbook as well as a textbook for the student to write in the book itself. It's helpful and encouraging for the student to be able to look back at his/her previous work and appreciate the progress. However, since this book is out of print and hard to find, I now write on a copy of the practice pages so that I can leave the original book pristine since I will some day be unable to find a copy anywhere.<br /><br />The most recent copy I purchased is for my 11 year old son and I'm enjoying, once again, watching a child take pleasure in learning to write beautifully."
650,4,I thought this was a very good book.  Has very helpful things to help a person.  Thank you for the inspiring book.
651,4,"Part I, APPROACHING THE RESURRECTION, opens with an excellent chapter on Midrash, which is a form of story-telling in which the Jewish scriptures would be searched for a story that was in some way comparable to an event, as an example, in the life of Jesus. It was the first time I really understood what that word means.<br /><br />Part II, EXAMINING THE BIBLICAL TEXTS, deals with how the biblical writers present the resurrection. As a starting point, Spong writes, \\""I explore this territory as a believing Christian who will not literalize the details of my faith story\\"" (p.107). I have decided it's easier being a unbeliever than a \\""believer in exile.\\"" It's hard to draw the line between what literally might have happened, what is midrash and what is pure fabrication to advance a particular agenda. Believers have it easy - they just accept it all, no matter how much sense it may not make; so do agnostics, who just throw out the baby with the bathwater. And then there are those of us who want to change the bathwater without throwing out the baby! THAT'S the difficult task!<br /><br />Part III goes into INTERPRETIVE IMAGES, such as the image of the atoning sacrifice in the Book of Hebrews (excellent treatise!), the Suffering Servant of 2 Isaiah (chapter 12, which was a bit of a stretch for me, yet in a way too simplistic), the Son of Man in the book of Daniel (a surprisingly interesting chapter).<br /><br />Part IV CLUES THAT LEAD US TO EASTER. The first clue is that the resurrection happened in Galilee and not Jerusalem, which presented a whole new and strange idea for me and which took a rather convoluted route to pursue. It made me shake my head as if to say, \\""whaaaaat?\\"" (I haven't the foggiest idea how to summarize that idea!) The fifth clue, \\""The Burial Tradition as Mythology\\"" was a superb chapter! More midrash: the words of Jesus on the Cross used by Matthew and Mark, \\""My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\\"" is word-for-word verse 1 of Psalm 22 - casting lots for Jesus' garments is also from Psalm 22 (v.18) - Jesus keeping silent before Pilate and the Sanhedrin (Mark 14:61) harkens back to Isa. 53:7, \\""He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth. He was led like a lamb to slaughter.... like a sheep before its shearer...he opened not his mouth.\\"" These are but a few of the midrash references.<br /><br />Part V, RECONSTRUCTING THE EASTER MOMENT. Chapter 19, \\""But Did It Happen,\\"" started out as a gem of rhetoric. Spong writes (p.237-8): \\""Speculation about what happened cannot replace the conviction that something real transpired....  If I could not move my search beyond angelic messengers, empty tombs and ghostlike apparitions, I could not say yes to Easter. I will not allow my twentieth-century mind to be compromised by the literalism of another era.... We can reject the literal narratives about the resurrection and still not reject the truth and power of the resurrection event itself.... We would not have the legends unless there had been a moment so indescribable that legends became necessary to explain it.\\""<br /><br />But towards the end of this chapter, Spong's words failed me. Suddenly \\""God\\"" seemed more like the traditional \\""Father in Heaven\\"" (or so his words sounded to me). Sometimes Spong tries so hard to explain himself and sometimes gets a little mystical-sounding, which leaves me behind... He writes (p.256): \\""God had in fact come out of heaven to dwell in Jesus....\\"" Somehow this doesn't sound like Spong's  description of God as the Ground of All Being - but I admit I'm still struggling with being able to relate to that non-external, non-theistic \\""God.\\""<br /><br />Chapter 20, \\""Grounding the Speculation in Scripture,\\"" was a very difficult chapter to follow. I will have to read it a few more times to make any sense out of it. It was beyond me...<br /><br />Although chapters 12 and 20 were tedious and wordy at times, the book on the whole is a good read with a fair amount of mind-bending ideas and insights. Spong fans who are \\""believers in exile\\"" should enjoy this one."
652,4,"Pretty good all around.  No major complaints except it's such a simplistic story.  But this is a good picture book version of the Call of Samuel and it's nice to get a visual on this Bible Story for children…  I guess my only hesitation is the price.  I wanted to find a used version cheaper somewhere, but the book itself is fairly small.  Seems like it should be priced at $9.99 max."
653,4,"The recipes are great.  This book is packed with plenty of them.  I wish there were more photos to help a novice see what the dish should look like, though."
654,4,Good.  Not what I was expecting but I can still use the product.  My fault for not reading the whole description.
655,5,"This book is what it says it is. Primarily it is a book about the city of Palmyra and its empire. Secondly it is a book about Zenobia and her revolt against Rome.<br />For anyone interested in Palmyra the book offers a thorough investigation of the city, its beginnings, culture and economy. Different archeological findings are taken into account.<br />Much of the history concerning Zenobia is built upon using the Historia Augustana with a few other resources taken into account. The author uses Gibbon extensively as a secondary resource, while also discussing Alexander Baron’s treatment of the subject in his novel “Queen of the East.”"
656,5,"My daughter brought this book home from a school book fair last year and both of my kids (ages 6 and 4, boy and girl) love reading it and talking about all the different kinds of families there are in our lives.  I'm also a social worker and work with lots of kids from all kinds of families. I think this is a fantastic book for any child, but especially for the kids that I work with daily who are looking for some confirmation that their &#34;different&#34; family configuration is normal and wonderful.  I'm buying this book right now for another one of the families I work with."
657,5,"THIS IS A DELIGHTFULLY WRITTEN BOOK OF ARTICLES ON TOPICS THAT HAVE BROAD INTERSTS FOR MANY AMERICANS.  BRET BURQUEST WRITES IN A CLEAR, CONSISE MANNER THAT MAKES EASY SENSE OF DIFFICULT IDEAS, WITH THE ADDED BONUS OF LAUGH OUT LOUD COMMENTS."
658,5,An amazing book on sleep paralysis. Ryan Hurd really knows what he's talking about- easy and fun to read and reference. Brought me lots of insight and peace of mind :)
659,5,"My brother gave me this book a few years ago to read on the plane when I was heading back to my new home from Alaska, where I grew up. I laughed out loud, unable not to, on the plane, in the airport. It is a WONDERFUL book!"
660,5,Best book I have read lately. Offers encourgement for all who will receive its message.  This remins us that we are not alone in the battle
661,5,"I was there, I lived thru the time and the American protests. I liked hearing someone else view and to know that I wasn't wrong after all. The US government let the  people of Vietnam down but it is nothing like what is happening in the middle east there is no comparison."
662,5,Awesome cookbook with great tasting simple paleo recipes. I loved the first Well Fed and the second one doesn't disappoint. For anyone looking for a great paleo cookbook or just some healthier food options in the kitchen I definitely recommend this book hasn't left my kitchen counter since it came in the mail.
663,3,"The author has 'rock star' status among physics teachers.  I was hoping to supplement my teaching with material from the book.<br />After reading selected sections carefully, I think it will have a small impact on my lectures.  I would be unable to use it as a textbook, however - too much of normal freshman physics syllabus is not even mentioned in the text.  Probably a good text for 'Physics for Poets' or something like that."
664,1,I thought this was like an e-book CD-ROM but unfortunately its not. It's has quizzes and games that relate to the book. I should of read the fine print.
665,5,"This book definitely helped her express her emotions, and it gave her the understanding that it was okay to have whatever feelings she was or is experiencing."
666,5,"This book is interesting and informative. The author's writing is very clear and understandable. I would recommend this book for those who want to learn the importance of why humans are the way we are, how our evolutionary past affects us now, and how our present culture plays a big part on our health."
667,5,Charlene Costanzo has such a loving heart and her books have truly been a blessing to me.  I highly recommend The Twelve Gifts for Healing is a wonderful book.
668,5,Cool book that will help you lose the weight you need.  you must change your life now and follow the paleo life style!
669,4,I enjoy reading through This Handbook of Dimensional Measurement is a helpful tool in my daily work as a metrologist.
670,5,"Purchased this for my daughter's college coursework.  The book arrived quickly, and contained exactly what we were expecting.<br /><br />What was missing was the DVD, but my daughter was able to get it from a classmate."
671,5,"A MUST READ for true crime enthusiasts. I grew up in Cedar Rapids Iowa  and met Tim in the late 1980's when my ex boyfriend's mother took him into her home. I had not seen or heard from him since then. I was recommended this book just a few weeks ago by a friend who also knew Tim.<br />M. William Phelps writes in a way that creates emotion within you after reading each page. Detailed accounts of the detectives and witnesses made this true story a fascinating read. So many twists and turns and intrigue, it was impossible to put this book down.<br />I will definitely be purchasing more of M. William Phelp's books. His style is unique and riveting."
672,5,"I'm a Marriage & Family Therapist with a specialty in emotional and verbal abuse. Again and again, I find that adults remain scarred by the pain they suffered in childhood. Wouldn't it be great if we can reach the maximum number of children *now* who are suffering emotionally? Bill King has made headway in this area in his new book, Stinkin' Thinkin' Stinks. The exercises in the book are nearly identical to those I give my own adult clients - with one exception: They are created at a child's level. Children with \\""get\\"" what the author is trying to say and will be eager to put the exercises to practice. According to Mr. King's research, children often turn around their attitudes and behavior shortly after reading even small portions of this powerful book. I heartily recommend it."
673,2,"Just some excerpts from phone calls, covering a very narrow range of topics.  Little effort put into book.  Just a moneymaker."
674,2,"Since this work was written in 1922, naturally, it’s outdated. However, it’s not the reason for my displeasure from this short history. Wells starts by covering the possible origins of our world to the classical world up to World War I. He does this by devoting 2-3 pages to each event, which he deems important enough. But 2-3 pages are not nearly enough to cover sufficiently, well, pretty much anything. Reading about ancient Greece, for example, you will learn that Plato founded the Academy in Athens and that Aristotle was his student, and on a side note that Aristotle was to become a tutor of Alexander the Great. After I finished reading this work, I felt I did learn a few new things, but only in a very shallow manner without any (even the slightest) deeper understanding. On a more positive note, it’s well written and fairly enjoyable to read."
675,5,"Novelist Daniel Printz hits the ground running with this fabulous tale of a sleepy Florida beachside community and the sometimes sleezy underbelly of small town politics. In a genre made famous by such authors as Carl Hiassen and Tim Dorsey, Printz proves to be a new light in the world of Florida noir fiction and has a great way of developing characters that are realistic and so well-textured that you're sure they really exist. I couldn't recommend this book higher for fun discussions at book clubs and for exciting beach reading or whenever you have the opportunity to read. Readers would do well to buy into Printz early!"
676,5,"I enjoy this self teach method. if you already know how to read sheet music it's a little too basic. Does not contain as many chords as I would like but its a good start for the basic beginner. The DVD is presented well but skips alot of the songs and focuses mostly on skill set, but the CD makes up for this in every way for play along."
677,5,"I had a number of relatives in the 50th Georgia Vol. Inf., and have done a lot of research on the 50th Georgia Regiment.  It is historically accurate, and makes their action in the War easy to follow for any interested person.  His addition to letters from members of other regiments from opposing sides plus letters from the members of the 50th and their families make &#34;Long Time Gone&#34; read like a novel rather than a book filled with military research.  Mr. Rolston has a winner here, and the kind of book which could be made into a movie.  I recommend it to anyone with the slightest interest in the War and the human interest of those who endured it by making the common soldier come alive, and this is it's charm for me."
678,5,"A great play, with some hard hitting thoughts in it. I recommend it to anyone interested in philosophy. Came in brand new condition. I am really pleased with it."
679,4,The item was as described the picture is exactly to the point. easy to deal with communication easy with dealer.
680,4,Considering the age of this book and how difficult to find a copy I was pleased with its condition and how well it was packed.
681,5,I great story of the night time ninja.  Made me giggle at familiar sights.  Its nice to see everyday occurrences made in to lovely stories for the family to share.
682,5,"It's both old-fashioned and British, so at the beginning I was expecting it to be tedious, but I was wrong. I actually wanted to see what would happen next, and was charmed by the no-doubt old-fashioned British slang. I also liked learning what village life was like and how things were done in that time (between the World Wars). It's actually a story about kids being more capable than grownups give them credit for. Recommended."
683,5,"Lovely as a summer's day...oh yes.  Every woman must own this book.  It says exactly what no living man seems to.  Yet Will is like silk, he's so good at it."
684,4,"As a fan of Mary Wickes' performances, and one who met her on several occasions, I was eager for this book. I'm a fellow St. Louisan.  I enjoyed the details and the thorough coverage regarding her professional and personal life.  The element that struck me as missing from this are actual quotes from Wickes herself.  There are many interviews with Wickes through her decades in the entertainment industry;  the profiles and quotes are out there, in print.  Why were none of these utilized ?  Rarely do you hear the woman herself &#34;speak&#34; in this book and that is disappointing. I would have loved to have seen more photos and illustrations from her spanning career.  They're out there, just not presented in this book.  I'm sure there were many, many images from her personal collection (which the author had access), but possibly the publisher severly limited this.  Too bad for us.  Overall, this will most likely be the only book ever written about the actress and it's a good read."
685,5,"This book seems very simple, but simple things often have a mighty impact. Saying your affirmations the way Noah St. John suggests really makes that resistance go away."
686,1,I knew this was a used book and I am a great fan of used books. However I am not prepared to accept Questions and Answers that have been completed/marked with biro pen in one chapter and yellow highlighted in another.
687,4,"Fairy tales and comic books are great resources to practice a foreign language in the printed form.  \\""Los Tres Cabritos,\\"" a story about three brother goats needing to cross a bridge over the Rio Grande to get to Mexico but getting stopped by the Chuapacabra, a goat-eating monster, is a good practice read.  The Spanish is about at the second year level, and whatever words are unknown can be easily looked up.  This story is a delight for both native readers and for those learning the language.  The illustrations are also very nice."
688,5,"This book is not a glossy coffee-table book brimming with color plates of lush hanging baskets of new begonia hybrids. However, I refer to it frequently to identify new additions to my collection of species begonias.  Although this book from 2005 concentrates on a hundred species or so that are presently in cultivation, the author also continues to discover and characterize new species from the wild. He is a true scholar and the descriptions of the begonias in this book will make it easy to confirm identification of most of the begonia species that can be purchased today.  There are some color images of species begonias in situ and in various greenhouse environments, but what the book is best at is the meticulous descriptions of the leaves, flowers, fruit and stems of begonias that are (or were) found in the wild."
689,4,One of the few books regarding the topic of sunflowers.  Many colorful photos help the reader determine the many sunflower varieties.
690,5,Tons of old RESTORED photos and memories of an important day in 20th century history.  I enjoy all the history that is represented in these pages.
691,5,"This author has a way of unfurling the story, with plenty of surprises along the way. I bought it. I read it. I liked it!"
692,5,"P.D. Eastman used to work for Disney many years ago, then broke away to start his own independent business. He never looked back, and created many of these very successful Beginner Books, which were translated into 4 languages (at least) and appeal to kids of many backgrounds. My children enjoyed my collection, and now their children are devouring them too."
693,5,"I JUST FINISHED READING THIS STORY AND IT CCOULD MIRROR SO MANY FAMILIES LIVES THAT I KNOW. I LIKE THE DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEWS THAT  MRS MCMILLIAN  TOLD THE STORY FROM. NO BODY EVERY ASKS  THE KIDS HOW THEY  FEEL ABOUT THEIR SITUATION.  I APPLAUD ALL THE GRANDMOTHERS THAT HAVE TO STEP IN AND RAISE THEIR KIDS CHILDREN. IN THIS STORY, THE GRANDMOTHER IS DEALING WITH HER SICK HUSBAND AND  THREE WAYWARD KIDS. ONE IS IN JAIL, ONE IS AN ADDICT AND THE OTHER ONE JUST FORGOT WHERE HE CAME FROM.  WHEN THE DAUGHTTER DROPS THE  KIDS OFF AND MOVES TO ATLANTA WITH HER NEW HUSBAND, GRANDMA HAS TO DEAL WITH HER TWO GRANDSONS AND HER OWN SIBLING ISSUES. THIS BOOK WILL MAKE YOU LAUGH AND CRY AT THE SAME TIME. YOU WILL ENJOY THE CHARACTORS AND THEIR STORIES."
694,5,"After checking it out from the library, I decided this was a keeper, and ordered a copy.  Very thorough and readable."
695,5,everything was fine on time no damage could reccomend for any one<br />everything was fine on time no damage could reccomend for any one
696,5,"This  short and easy-to-read letter, written for all Christians, is a wonderful way to understand how fundamental to our very life is our Faith. I thank God daily for the gift of Faith and I thank Him for my parents and family who nurtured my Faith. It is the light that enlightens me through the perplexities and trials of life. I encourage non-believers to read Lumen Fidei: the Light of Faith. It may show you what is missing in your life."
697,4,"Isabel Beebe has returned to Fool's Gold temporarily, to manage her late grandmother's bridal shop before the family decides what to do with it. She plans to leave after the holidays, when she and friend Sonia will take NYC by storm with their own boutique. Isabel's first crush, Ford Hendrix is also back in town, finally out of the military and in business with two friends.  Of course, Isabel wrote to her first love, from the age of fourteen for about ten years, chronicling her life events, never receiving any response.  Now, Ford needs a favor. In order to keep his mother off his back, he asks Isabel to be his pretend girlfriend. One would think that in such a small town this type of deception wouldn't be possible, but Mallery makes it work. I was worried that this time worn story device would seem worn, but Isabel and Ford really came alive as characters and I believed in both their deception and eventual bumps in said deception. I think Mallery is a great storyteller, in addition to a side romance brewing with Ford's brother Kent, we are introduced to new characters who will no doubt populate new stories set in Fool's Gold."
698,4,"The Fall by Colleen Nelson was a pretty powerful read for me.  It shows the way a death can affect different people in different ways.  Where in one character, it gave him the strength to finally stand up for himself, in another it caused a downward spiral from which it seems there is no turning back, and in another, it strengthened a bond that was lost a long time ago.<br /><br />Ben's love for skateboarding is something that he can turn to, to escape his hurt and pain caused by a non-existent father who disappoints him time and time again, and with hopes and aspirations of being sponsored and becoming a pro skater, there isn't much that will stop him from doing what he loves.<br /><br />After a run in with school bullies Taz, Luke, and Cory, an act of \\""kindness\\"" from Ben causes Luke to start befriending Luke.  Unfortunately for Ben, hanging with Luke and his crew is not really his scene...drinking, drugs, and the trouble.  But a fight with his best friend Tess is the deciding factor in Ben's decision in hanging out with them.<br /><br />But in the blink of an eye, Ben's pretty quiet life is turned upside down after a tragic accident.  But the accident doesn't only affect Ben.  It affects the new group he's been hanging with, and some deal with it worse than others.  Some end off veering down the wrong path, and into a darkness that sucks them deeper and deeper.<br /><br />The Fall by fellow Winnipegger, Colleen Nelson, is a read that captured my attention and held it.  Even though the book is a fairly quick read, the book ended pretty quick for me as I was completely engrossed in the story, and in the lives of the main character.<br /><br />All of them have problems at home, which some readers will be able to connect with.  Author, Colleen Nelson, does a fantastic job in showing the different lifestyles that these boys come from.  The storyline in The Fall is one that cause many different emotions to come to surface.  The way in which she shows just how awful fellow classmates can be is pretty shocking.  How quickly their impressionable minds can be so quickly swayed was pretty shocking...and to be honest...very real.<br /><br />I found my emotions running wild while reading The Fall.  The way in which the author was able to spin my emotions sadness to happiness to fear in the blink of an eye was fantastic and left my head spinning.  Her detailed descriptions of various events as they unfolded were done so well, that you can't help but feel like you're part of the story.  I do wish that there was more in end.  It ended pretty sudden, and left some questions unanswered for me.  I know that there's enough information presented that the reader can come to their own conclusions, but I still found myself wondering what happens to these characters.<br /><br />I personally feel like this is a book that readers everywhere should experience.  To see the impact of death, and to witness the strengths that people didn't know they had until after tragedy strikes."
699,5,I love the book Revelation of Jesus Christ: Commentary on the Book of Revelation. It digs deep into the meanings of the imagery involved in the book of Revelation. The author also breaks down each chapter and verse defining words from their Greek root to give a fuller comprehension. I have the advantage of taking the class with the author Dr. Ranko Stefanovic. Really awesome!

701,5,"I found myself connecting with Hayley Hobson as I read this book. To say her book is insightful really doesn't even begin to scratch the surface. I can't wait for the next book...is there going to be a next book? :-)  I am hoping so. Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. This book has so many useful things in there. Motivational, yoga moves that anyone can do, recipes,oh and my favorite top 10 reasons to have more sex.... its really just the way she puts her own life experiences and how she overcame them was so helpful to me. This book is well worth the price.<br />Oh and one last thing she mentions somewhere in the book that we really have to learn to listen to our bodies. That's so true.. It motivated me to get my life back on track. :-)"
702,4,Recommend to anyone who is interested in reading the autobiography of a most important peritus at the Second Vatican Council
703,5,"Yes, that's what the M.B.E. after Mansfield's name signifies. The most junior order of the British ranks of chivalry, it comprises the most living members, some 100,000. Mansfield was a chess problem composer. Players are only the main category of chess world citizens. There are also collectors of chess books, sets, cartoons, memorabilia, etc., and there are problem composers, too. All play at some level of skill but in each splinter group, greatness is found on the higher rungs of the ladder. Mansfield was considered one the three best problem composers in the world at the time of his death in 1984. FIDE (F&eacute;d&eacute;ration internationale des &eacute;checs or World Chess Federation) ranks him 27th with a total of 94,33 points in their FIDE Album, wherein its Permanent Commission for Chess Compositions (PCCC) publishes collections of the best problems and scores selected entries.<br /><br />I have a special interest in this book. I accidentally parted with it when I sold my large chess library several years ago. It happens to contain a chess problem attributed to Karol J&oacute;zef Wojtyła, more commonly remembered as the late Pope John-Paul II. Whether truth or conjecture I can't say, but Wojtyła's uncle was famed Polish problem composer M. Wr&oacute;bel and the chess connection seems more probable than not. My friend, the late George Koltanowski, wrote the introduction to this book. Kolty claims to have played chess with John-Paul II. He did live near the big cathedral in San Francisco, where the Pope stayed during his visit. So again... probability.<br /><br />Part of my interest lies in the fact that my parents put a small fortune in those little donation envelopes for Bishop Fulton J. Sheen and serious doubts have been cast about whether any of the money actually reached the poor children in Africa for whom it was ostensibly intended. I hatched a plan to try to recoup some of that sacrificial revenue by painting the Pope's several chess problems posed with standard pieces on a pleasant wood board. Then I produced prints to sell online. Turns out they are not so popular as I had hoped. In my Pope problem paintings, I include a glimpse of the books that contain the solutions to his compositions. For a peek at this book and the problem that inspired me to hunt down a replacement copy for my current chess shelf, see this page in my website: [...]<br /><br />UPDATE 4 OCTOBER 2013 -- Book arrived today in tip-top condition, way ahead of projected ETA. The description of the copy I ordered stated that it bears Koltanowski's autograph - and there it was on the intro page - thus doubling my joy. It even included a correction page inserted after a chess diagram that was missing a couple critical pieces! This wasn't available in my original copy. Incidentally, the price of the book way back when was $5.50 but as it's been long out-of-print, I feel fortunate and privileged to have found it at all.

704,5,"This is close in manner to the first collection, Silence in the Snowy Fields, which I have loved since I first read it in the late 60's. I prefer it over the more political poems such as those in The Light Around the Body."
705,5,"(From an email to the author, who asked me to post my comments here)  Your book, MAKING HOSTILE WORDS HARMLESS, is one I've admired, referring many of my clients to it.  I used to be a self-defense instructor while helping to put myself through grad school.  My class was half physical defense against physical assault, and half assertive defense against psychological assault.  Your book would have been required reading for the course, as it is a perfect support.<br /><br />Since I am a long-term EMDR therapist, you might understand I was very excited to learn that you are an EMDR therapist and member of EMDRIA.<br /><br />I honestly have not had time to finish the book, or felt the great need personally at this point in my life.  However, from what I have read, it is a great contribution.  I noticed one review saying that the comments suggested could be taken sarcastically.  The key to sarcasm is the attitude and it shows in the eyes.  Kate Cohen-Posey is recommending honesty, and a broad view -- an ability to see from both points of view.  As I see it, she is avoiding conflict and moving toward a greater understanding.  If you keep that in mind, you will grow in emotional maturity from reading her book, and you will not come off sarcastically."
706,5,A plan for saving this country. Period. Mark delivers an easy and understandable plan of action to begin the process of returning our country back to the path our founders intended.
707,5,"More than the characters and the story itself I found myself drawn to the societal implications of the world of Divergent. I think its an excellent concept that won't be fleshed out as much as I'd probably like, much like The Hunger Games which ended with me having more questions than answers about a world I get short view of. This isn't a failing of the authors however, because they are speaking through one character who would not need or want to know every single detail of the world around them.<br /><br />As for the characters I found them likable enough, the romance felt a little forced but the plot was good. Learning about the factions, what they were founded to be and what they have become due to corruption over time. I will glad read the rest of this trilogy."
708,1,"I needed to get the entire volume of the sixth edition, not the sixth book. It was my fault, but I am going to return it right away hopefully there is a refund..."
709,5,"I love this album, when I first poped it in I thought I would be over it quick but so far from over it, i can't take it out of my cd player.  And number 11 &#34;million miles&#34; makes me want to fall in love...such a beautiful song.  God is good, this is a must have if you are into creative, meaningful music!"
710,4,"I read many Business Books as part of my job and I am always looking for new ideas, tools for clients and practical solutions to leadership problems. This book has been written by my friend and colleague Stephen Lynch. Stephen is a talented, disciplined and smart business thought leader. He has been instrumental in building the RESULTS.com brand and in creating tools that solve the problem business leaders seek.....that of how to cut through the chaos of business as usual and execute strategic actions. A researcher and strategic thinker by nature, Stephen has told his story whilst outlining the world class Business framework that RESULTS.com has pulled together from the best thinkers around the world. When I got this book to preview I was expecting little given that I use this framework on a daily basis helping CEO's with change. I actually didn't put it down. Firstly I learnt more about Stephen and just how he came to be so disciplined in his approach (he is a high achiever in whatever space he decides to focus on) and secondly it was a great reminder of why the Business Execution is so important. It is a useful tool for anyone looking to simplify their business by focusing on the important rather than the urgent. I recommend it as a book to read and use and to share with those in your leadership team."
711,1,"Revisionist propaganda at the expense of our children? What responsible, loving parent, regardless of political affiliation, would subject their child to such blatant mistruths? Critical thinking based on unbiased facts are imperative today more than ever...this book delivers neither."
712,1,"Upon picking this item up I was very concerned by the cover photo. The daughter is wearing pants and riding a bike (how masculine!) and the boy clearly has been the victim of liberal leniency to have a shaggy (effeminate) haircut like that. Thankfully within a few pages my fears were assuaged when I found out that the authors adhere to the very tried and true methodology of conversion therapy of \\""encouraging\\"" traditional 1950's gender roles for young people. How can one's physical and emotional makeup withstand the allure of conforming to good old fashioned gender norms? I'm so glad that authors like this have not stayed current on what the medical and psychological health communities have to say about the causes and treatments of homosexuality or else we might not have ever been blessed with this gem of wisdom. I will be applying these practices to my own children as soon as they begin to crawl because I will not allow the predominant commie culture to rob my children of the simple joy of turning over their will in favor of the greater good."
713,2,"The pluses of this book are that it covers many Oracle XML topics and contains lots of examples.<br /><br />The minuses are that many of the topics are not covered in any depth, the examples are barely explained at all and many do needlessly complex things which just obscures the point that the author is presumably trying to illustrate.<br /><br />I am fairly proficient using the XML features of SQL Server and I was hoping this book would help me learn how to do the equivalent tasks in Oracle. Sadly it has not."
714,5,"I loved how Ms. Robert's tied the story line of this took to the story line of her previous book, X Marks the Scot.  To Wed a Wicked Highlander had everything that I have come to expect from Victoria's books.....it kept me so interested that I finished reading it extremely quickly even with my busy schedule.  I couldn't seem to put it down.  I loved this whole series of books from the first one, Temptation in a Kilt; to the second one, X Marks the Scot; to the final one To Wed a Wicked Highlander.  I can't wait for Victoria's next book to come out.  I generally do not read this type of book, but I must say that Victoria's characters and story lines have left me wanting more......a very talented author indeed.  Keep them coming Victoria."
715,5,I love the recipes but I bought the book for the nutrition information and the wealth of knowledge and understanding that he imparts.
716,5,Kids and adults of all ages seem to enjoy this book. Whenever someone comes over my kids bring out this book and it keeps our guest busy for a while.
717,5,"Realistically, I'd shoot for a 4.5 or 4.7, but I figured I'd round up because I feel this was better than a 4. I found the characters compelling and relate-able enough to keep me turning page after page."
718,5,"Holy Ghosts was an excellent read. Growing up in a Catholic home, I was always led to believe that ghosts were all demonic. It was an even greater fear seeing ghost activity as a small child. Growing up being sensitive to ghost activity was really rough as child and continued into adulthood. Reading Gary Jansen's words and how he related the activity in his home and by the fact that his mother was sensitive to ghost activity as well helped me to understand a lot about myself. He did an excellent job bringing Catholic history into his writings and demonstrating with examples from the Bible that having abilities is not demonic and is indeed a gift. This book helped me to understand far more than I ever would have imagined and gave me so much peace. I began a paranormal group on Facebook that now has about 800 members from most states and many different countries who share paranormal interests. I have recommended Gary Jansen's book quite frequently because many people have the same fears and misunderstandings that I once had, and I have yet to hear nothing but great reviews and positive feedback by those that have read Holy Ghosts. In addition, I assist several different Paranormal Investigation groups with my abilities where I have also recommended this book with the same excellent responses. We all have had such a great love for the book that we had Gary Jansen as a speaker for one of our quaterly meetings. I actually ordered more copies to give as gifts."
719,5,"I just broke up with my boyfriend of 2 years after listening to this audiobook.  I tried for over two months to encourage him to read it.  I was gentle, I used \\""I\\"" words, I am mature and believe I know how to communicate.  He told me he had ADHD after one year into the relationship and I didn't have any idea because not only had I never dealt with any with it but I actually didn't even believe in it!  He was on a medication for 10 years (age 6 - 16) and refused to ever do that again.<br /><br />After listening to this, I has so much hope.  The book is excellent and I feel as though anyone with ADHD must listen to it.  There is no stigma attached here, quite the opposite.  The author is so encouraging and I know that if my boyfriend had listened, he would have gotten something out of it.  However, his reaction is \\""I know my own mind\\"", yet he uses the ADHD as an excuse for all of the things that upset and hurt me.  I have tried and tried to change my anger reactions and to understand that my feelings of disappointment and frustration were all because of the ADHD.<br /><br />However, after listening to this and reading another book on the topic, I decided that I am simply not strong enough to cope with his issues if he is unwilling to cope with them, too.  We had some success - I set a timer for 20 minutes on several occasions and we talked and it was wonderful, but then he is sucked right back into the computer.  I have to make lists for him to do simple things like make the bed (I leave the house before he does) but if I don't remind him to look at the list, he doesn't.  I am bipolar - he is great with it.  He is kind-hearted, funny, gregarious and I love him deeply.  But I am burned out.  I'm glad I read this book because I honestly thought something was wrong with me and that I had an inability to communicate or that I was uninteresting."
720,5,"If you want to do crewelwork, this book is about the best one that I have found. It clearly shows the stitches and how you can put them together. It is the one I carry with me when I travel."
721,5,"This was a required text book for my Garde Manger class at the Art Institute of Culinary Arts.  So, It was a must buy.  All-in-all it's a great tool to have in my library of books to use a guide and reference.  Great illustrations."
722,5,I found this book to be quite interesting and informative.  The history and historical photographs were great.  The survey of flora and fauna was most helpful.  Found a flower in this book that we had photographed on Clingmans Dome but it was not identified in any other book we had on Smokies wildflowers.  Very inspirational for any lovers of The Great Smoky Mountains National Park.
723,5,"it is a great book about the raw nature of trading.  it is what all trading is based on.  it deals with the market in the present tense, while the technical indicators  like the moving averages, macd, etc.  are lagging indicators."
724,5,This book is in the process of changing my  life for the better. I recommend it to everyone. Ok people close to me. Also try out Nick's tappingsolution.com/insiders-club. Well worth the subscription.
725,5,My husband has really enjoyed reading the book.  He has learned so many things about the family.  so glad i bought it for him.
726,5,This book was a lot of fun for the whole family. The music was great as was the story. I highly recommend.
727,4,"I have a Daughter in College Biology who tried to run off with the book, until she read the section on &#34;breach baby birth&#34;<br /> and got the heebie-jeebies.<br /><br />Bought book for the purpose of having a supplement to more generic &#34;medical&#34; manuals for families."
728,5,This guide is absolutely amazing ha everything u need to know about the game! Definitely worth the buy! Also brings an awesome key chain that I haven't taken off my keys !!!!!
729,1,"I bought this for a dear friend for her birthday, when she unpacked it from the plastic we started looking through it and discovered that some of the pages were upside down and some of the months were without puppy pictures at all, I was very embarrassed, and she was stuck with a calendar that is totally unusable."
730,3,"To me, both Wool and Shift were easily 5 star books/collections. The combination of believable and likable characters, good tension and build up, and the slow and enticing unwinding of Howey's intriguing universe kept me entrapped from page to page. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for Dust. I don't know what went wrong, but I struggled to connect with the characters in the same way I had previously. Maybe it is because their development climaxed in Shift. Between Shift and Dust we see the characters largely (though not wholly) emerge from the inner struggles that defined them previously and instead find conflict inter rather than intra-personally.<br /><br />But more disappointingly, it seems that most of the discoveries of the Silo universe (or rather the discoveries Howey was willing to reveal) were already uncovered in the first two books. Although there is closure for some of the characters (in what I consider too predictable a conclusion), there was nothing substantively new revealed about the dynamics of the \\""dust\\"" and its final impact on the world, the fate of the \\""lost\\"" silos, or of the silos' engineering in general. On more minor notes, the ultimate outcome of one of the main silos is left in doubt and a subplot about a religious cult left noticeably underdeveloped. In sum, this book doesn't feel like a real conclusion. I'm sure this was Howey's intention as he leaves room for the wonderful fan fiction that has popped up around the trilogy. But as a huge fan of the Silo Saga, the author's own \\""ending\\"" just doesn't do it for me."
731,4,"I have no clue where to start with this book, so I guess I'll just start by saying how much I LOVED the book. The whole plot/story line is absolutely brilliant!!! Dahl was able to a book understandable enough for a ten year old to read and enjoy, yet interesting enough for an adult to be captivated by it! This book was a step up from Dahl's Dreamers in the sense that it had a slightly more of a mature feel to it than it's first-installment counter part which may or may not have been in part to the growing of this writer's talents. Although it might have been more with the plot line itself, being in the wake of an 'epic battle' n' all. The only thing that annoyed me completely IMO is the narration, which is more likely than not, just my huge personal preference. But just a beware for anyone on the boarder of getting, read the free sample you're allowed to get to try and get a feel for the narration before buying it. It definitely wasn't too big of a problem for me though, especially with the intriguing plot line, the supporting characters and the suspense that built up over the course of the book/series. Loved this book, will be definitely recommending it to anyone I know, and can't wait to see what will come from Dahl next!!!!!!!!!"
732,4,"I received this book free from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. I did not receive any form of compensation.<br /><br />This was the first book that this author has had published. She has also had a short story published.<br /><br />The timeline in this book goes back and forth between present day and the past. I loved being able to compare and contrast the modern world of today with the shamanic world of the past.<br /><br />As my family's resident genealogist, I do have to say that you can learn alot about yourself and your parents by learning more about your ancestors. And it is through finding out about her ancestors that Sheri is truly able to discover herself.<br /><br />I love how she found out about her ancestry though. I guess being a pagan and a Unitarian Universalist, I have a much more open mind when it comes to past lives and shamanism. The fact that these were featured prominently in this story was a huge bonus for me.<br /><br />I feel that Annette really did a wonderful job on creating believable characters and a story line that truly engrossed me."
733,5,what I enjoyed most was the fact it was written in a first person style. It was from her perspective as a child.
734,4,"I have been interested in how to become a successful entrepreneur, and it was a great relief to hear some of the highs and the lows as well. It gives great insight on what it takes to make it and how to perceive to rise to your dreams. This will give good insight on the up and coming entrepreneur."
735,5,"Fantastic scenery in seven countries narrated by a British man with a very pleasant accent.  The narration is very descriptive and the photography is great.  Only a small portion is actually shot from a train--in fact there is some aerial cinematography included.  About 55 minutes is devoted to each of the following areas: France, Spain, Austria, Germany, Austria, Ireland, and Belgium.  In each country a specific route is chosen--for example in France, the route is from Paris to Marseille (French Riviera) with lots of stops and details along the way.  The viewing quality is not diminished in the least in VHS format.  Greece and Scotland are two other countries available in this series, each sold separately.  This presentation is unique and you will see some things that other travel series don't include.  A great complement to other travel videos such as &#34;The Cruise Collection&#34; by Questar as well as Rick Steves and Rudy Maxa videos.  Great stuff and you can't beat the price!"
736,5,"I have had cancer myself, although not this type of cancer, and am interested in learning about any type I can for my own education. Cancer is a diverse and complicated disease with each type of cancer being different and complex. This type of breast cancer is one of the scariest to me due to the genetic factor. My sister in law is a person with the gene and her Aunt and her grandmother both had this cancer. Her Aunt survived, but her grandmother did not. My sister in law in considering radical surgery to prevent ever getting this disease just like Angelina Jolie, and this drew me to read about this cancer. This book not only fully educated on triple negative breast cancer but it is written so creatively and honestly I felt like I was reading a novel. Thank you to the author for sharing the knowledge and her personal story as it had to be difficult to be so honest."
737,4,"I was easily hooked into this series, and I loved it right from the start. James Patterson has done an amazing job with this very interesting story. And I read all the books with great joy really. And I would have given it five stars, if and only if James Patterson had done a better job at connecting some things in the book.. Sometimes the things that happened in the earlier books had nothing to do with the last books... And the end of last book was quite ridiculous and I didn't like it that much... But it's a good series, it was a bit depressing time to time but it definitely draws you in and gets you mesmerized to read them."
738,5,This book is a great addition to my collection of Kyra Sundance's books. Teaching my dogs tricks has helped to build their self-esteems and has strengthened our relationships with each other. Zorro is especially good at the Head Cock trick in this book.
739,5,"The second trade paperback in this series introduces the new Valiant Universe versions of the Eternal Warrior and the Geomancer, names that will be familiar to anyone who read comics back in the 1990s. Aram (Armstrong)  is one of three brothers who has been alive for thousands of years; his brother Gilad is the one who has been fighting for most of that time (thus the name Eternal Warrior, duh), much of that in service of various Geomancers (individuals who were selected by the universe itself to speak to the earth, and for it.<br /><br />Sound confusing? It's not, and most of the concepts are covered deftly in this book. You get the feeling it's important to the Valiant Universe (it certainly was the first time around). Kay McHenry is the Geomancer this time around; we get an introduction to her but she not featured too prominently throughout the rest of the book.<br /><br />Once again writer Fred Van Lente's wonderful sense of humor carries the book along. You get a sense of what motivates everyone in the story, and Archer finally begins to develop as more of a character than the naïve, earnest kid he was when he first met Armstrong. You also get more of a sense of his potential, which is impressive.<br /><br />This is another great book from Valiant and well worth the few bucks it will cost you."
740,1,"You won't find this helpful unless you're a 12 year old who's interested in photography, and even then, all you have to do is go through her photography tab on her blog and find the exact same information with, mostly, the same photos."
741,2,"I tried to like this novel, but in the end I gave up. I love sci-fi and the storyline behind Windhaven is a good one, but it fell flat in so many ways. I could not find a character worth rooting for, they appeared one-dimensional and wooden. I really found the lack of technology hard to believe. 700 years after their starships crashed, the descendants of the 'star sailors' are STILL using wings fashioned from the wreckage? What about inventing airplanes or electricity or even paper, so the Flyers can avoid reciting messages? I kept hoping a starship from another planet would arrive to cause real conflict that would bring the flyers and the land-bound together, but that never happened. I think Martin is better off in the world of Game of Thrones. Maybe he can re-write Windhaven one day...but until then, I would not recommend it."
742,5,"As an &#34;alum&#34; of one of the schools in the book, it was eye-opening and comforting to learn more about the industry that drives these programs. I have bought numerous copies for friends with teens that are struggling to help them avoid the nightmares and PTSD I'll endure for the rest of my life. The troubled teen industry has more staff working to take advantage of and manipulate parents than they do &#34;helping&#34; the teens, shameful!"
743,5,The best outline of the OT I have ever read. It has some highlighting but very properly done so I don't mind. The book was in good condition.
744,2,I didn't want to lern how to write a tracking journal as this book teaches. I simply wanted to learn some new stuff about tracking animals. If you want to learn to track animals skip this book. It is complete nonsense.
745,5,"With the keen insights of a teacher, historian and practitioner, Dr. John Pafford brings to life the remarkable story of President Grover Cleveland , the \\""Forgotten Conservative\\""  At a time when citizens are looking for political leadership based upon courage and conviction, Cleveland stands as a bold example of a principled public servant who would rather \\""lose an election than sacrifice his values\\"".  \\""Rediscovering\\"" is an appropriate description of this literary journey highlighting the character, philosophy and work ethic of Grover Cleveland, as well as his accomplishments and unique place in American history."
746,5,"There is much more here than just maps. The book includes charts, graphs, and well-condensed historical summaries organized by periods of church history. Is not &#34;whitewashed&#34; and treats off-shoot groups (Coomunity of Christ, etc.) with respect and equality.<br />Potentially very useful for lessons as well as general reference of LDS church related history."
747,5,I  bought another book about Maui but this book is easier to follow and has more ideas on the activities available in Maui.

750,5,"I found this book so thoroughly entertaining! I laughed throughout and found it difficult to put down. I could feel the rush of adrenaline as I read the nerve racking tales of go-cart racing. The wild dysfunctional family setting and outrageous hijinks between the two brothers, Rod and Homer Jr., created a candid and often surprising look into their lives. I was sad to finish the book and wished there was a sequel."
751,3,I have not read it yet. A lot of material that I will probably never use or need. Heavy tome.
752,3,"I like this book but not love it until the school break came, because is full of activities that i can't do know. Another think is that there are the same craft work for diferent animals, or object. I think that this kind of book is good for teachers."
753,5,"I have purchased these memory keepers for almost 30 years. I had them for my children, my grandchildren and now my great grandchildren. If you keep them up faithfully you will be amazed at how well their school years have been chronicled, both in pictures and learning. They are a true joy to present to your child when they graduate."
754,4,"I read any book I can about whatever I am interested in. This book is very good for those who have some experience in photography, although there is an introductory section that is written for someone who is clueless about cameras - this was a waste and a bit disappointing. When you are interested in night and low light photography, you are most likely not a beginner and likely have some good experience. That being said, that section was clear and concise. The rest was what I was looking for. There was nothing revelatory, but was very practical and engaging. Many valuable tips. Buy it."
755,5,"This is an outstanding book worthy of 5-stars all day long. I seen the movie way before reading the book so it was kind of neat being able to visualize the characters as I read. The book, however, had a few more kick-a$$ gory incidents which I wish they would have incorporated in to the film. You will find this out when you read it. Quality of the paperback (signet) is not the greatest, but considering the cheap price, it'll do. Even if you've seen the movie, I would still highly recommend reading the book. You will see the story through a different lens for which I'm certain you will not be disappointed."
756,5,"Purchased this book for an upper-level communication course and really enjoyed the interesting, complex cases the author presented. It was integrated well with my other text and served as an opportunity to discuss the application of interpersonal communication theories in \\""real life\\"" contexts or interactions. I ended up reading all of the cases, even the ones that weren't assigned because they were so interesting!"
757,5,"Described the rules in very detail, and spectacular photos which show the models in real. The printing on models and battlefield is perfect and bring me a lot of imagination of how the real game playing would be."
758,5,"Don't let this easy read fool you!!!  The words and stories told here reflect a strength of character that we all should strive for.<br /><br />Eric is a well known writer and speaker.  The first book I read by Eric Metaxas was Bonhoeffer - Pastor, Prophet, Martyr, Spy.  After I read that book, I knew I was holding literary gold in my hands.<br /><br />Eric Metaxas certainly hasn't disappointed with his latest book, 7 Men - And The Secret Of Their Greatness - Thomas Nelson Publisher 2013.  This book gives a much larger than a thumbnail sketch of 7 men - George Washington,  William Wilberforce, Eric Liddell, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Jackie Robinson, Pope John Paul II and Charles Colson.  Each of these men faced enormous challenges to their faith, their lives, their souls and each of these men came through stronger and filled with a deeper love for God and life itself.<br /><br />I admit, I didn't know 2 of the men, William Wilberforce and Eric Liddell.  The rest I knew about, some a bit more than others.  For instance, I had come to know Dietrich Bonhoeffer to a point where I felt I truly knew him, met him, talked with.  Of course I hadn't met him, he died before I was born, but the writing was so good that I felt as though I was there watching the events unfold before me.<br /><br />This is the feeling I got when I read about all the others in this book.  I learned things about each and every one of these men and grew in respect for them.  I was especially touched by Charles Colson's story.  I remember seeing him and watching the developments during those Watergate years.  My friend Sue and I watched the Watergate Hearings on tv while we worked together.  We didn't miss a day.  What we didn't see or hear was the very private anguish that was Charles Colson's as he realized his part in the Watergate Scandal and the ensuing years of prison and redemption.<br /><br />Eric Metaxas has done it again.  I highly recommend this book."

761,3,"I'm a Jewish American, from an Orthodox family, raised to think Israel was my destiny. I grew up singing Zionist songs, wore blue and white on Yom Ha'Atzmaut, and wore an Israeli army jacket on Purim. Those Zionist songs we sang are now antique, and probably as alien to modern Israelis as Captain Kangaroo is to Generation Y! Somehow I think most of the kids I grew up with will defriend me from facebook when they read this review. Oh well, here it goes....<br /><br />Noam Chayut is what those of us familiar with Israel would call a typical Israeli; independent, strong-willed, and arrogant. It makes sense that he'd be arrogant, because Israel was a country founded on two things; philosophy and desperation. The philosophy was that is was THEIR land, and desperation because it had to be done quickly and with no resources to do it with. Like most Israelis, Chayut goes into the army, becomes an officer, and by his own admittance, most of his work involves taking property, searching the kids rooms while they cower in the corner, all without any due process. I sholdn't criticize too much; the USA did the same in Iraq. Iraq and Afghanistan ain't the USA, so the Bill of Rights doesn't apply there.<br /><br />Then Chayut leaves the army and realises he was wrong. When he was a kid in school, the Holocaust was used to justify Israel's \\""fight for survival,\\"" but the Holocaust is over. It's no longer making sense as a reason for what Israel does. As for me, I realised a long time ago that the \\""settler\\"" movement was probably a mistake. Wherever the settlers go, the army follows. If there's an ancient Arab town nearby, the army puts it on lockdown.<br /><br />Now read the book \\""Home Girl\\"" by Judith Maitloff. This woman moves into a townhouse in Harlem, right before it became gentrified. The cops aren't much help, and maybe that's the best thing; she toughens up and learns to cope with the locals. Now think hard, what would happen if the NYC cops would stop, frisk, and detain everyone walking down the street, all because a white family moved in? I bet the white family's presence would not be welcome.<br /><br />Chayut's book reminds me of an article on psychopaths from \\""American Minds.\\"" There are some philosophies that encourage a lack of emathy for others, and I think Zionism is one of them. It's a philosophy that teaches you that you can't be wrong. Under Zionism, every single thing Israel does is perfect; forcing out an Arab town at gunpoint is seen as \\""security.\\""<br /><br />I've been losing sympathy for a lot of Israel's problems. Their government needs a policy of \\""move into Arab lands, and you do so at your own risk.\\"""
762,5,"This particular translation is a wonderful re-presentation of the thought of Karol Wojtyła, especially when read in the context of \\""The Acting Person,\\"" to which this book owes much of its language.<br /><br />Like \\""The Acting Person,\\"" the first translation suffered from many semantic flaws, which actually inhibit the work from properly fitting into the philosophical tradition. This can be noticed by even a cursory reading of the first page (!); the older translation misuses terms like \\""entity,\\"" where the philosophical tradition - even Wojtyła's own - uses the term \\""being.\\"" The ramifications of the older translation meant shutting this work off from all the philosophies which came before; with this translation, you can see how Wojtyła was seamlessly entering into the discourses of his time, conversing with Heidegger, Sartre, and the like.<br /><br />\\""Love and Responsibility\\"" needed a new translation, one which could be easily placed in the context of all of Wojtyła's other writings. This is that translation, so if you buy one version, make sure this is the one."
763,5,"Oh my God this book is hilarious, a must read for anyone, not just in Hollywood, but if you are trying to break into the movie business, then this is a survival guide for you, this is a fun read but not for the easily offended, I lived in Hollywood, CA in the early 90's for a while and can totally relate, I am sure the competition and hustle and bustle has gotten much more now, but read this book you will see how gritty, shocking, and lurid this book really is, but be laughing all the while.  thanks enjoy"
764,3,"I must say i thoroughly enjoyed this journey through suspenseful England as seen through the eyes of an indecisive music teacher. Having No chapters but merely \\""before\\"" and \\""after\\"" blocks adds to the intrigue.

765,1,"I can't believe the number of inaccuracies the author claims against the churches of Christ.  As another reviewer stated they would never call themselves Campbellites.  Also, they wouldn't know anything about the \\""five volume set of books entitled SOUND DOCTRINE\\"" nor the \\""three volume set entitled Hardeman's Tabernacle Sermons\\"".  Later the author mentions that the churches of Christ consider religious holidays sinful....again, something that is NOT taught.  The churches do not hold special services since Christ wants his followers to worship him weekly.<br /><br />The author mentions several men and what they may or may not have said in the past.  The churches of Christ would say to the author \\""what does the Bible say about this subject?\\"""
766,5,"Lois Lauer does an excellent job chronicling \\""phase two\\"" of The Center. Fifty years into its existence, things looked bleak for this local institution. The board of trustees asked Frank Sanders to come back and run The Center once more, in trying circumstances. Under his stewardship, and with the help of a dedicated staff, amazing volunteers, a loving family, and a remarkable fellowship, The Center thrived once more and is still thriving today. Lois does a great job telling this compelling story and includes nice sections by people (in their own voices) who were a big part of this successful rebuilding. There are also some beautiful photos. (In the interest of disclosure, I received a copy of this book as a thank you for proofreading it.)"

768,3,"This was the first companion novel to a series that I have ever read.  Since I'm no fan of short stories, I wasn't sure what I was going to think of it.  Keys to the Repository contains two bonus chapters: one featuring Jack and Schuyler, and one featuring Dylan Ward.  It also gives us the first two chapters of Misguided Angel (yay!).<br /><br />From reading other bloggers' reviews, I understand that some fans of the Blue Bloods series were confused reading The Van Alen Legacy.  I was able to follow the story just fine, but I had re-read the first three books in the series right before The Van Alen Legacy's release, so it was all fresh in my mind.  One of the things I love most about this series is that the story is so multi-layered and steeped in history.  I like that we can trace the origins of the Blue Bloods back through time.  Keys to the Repository provides helpful character bios and is like a refresher course in preparation for Misguided Angel.  It's not a must-read for fans of the series, but I would definitely recommend it.<br /><br />Just One Gripe:<br />Some of the writing was pretty dry.  At times it felt like I was reading  a history book.<br /><br />The Best Thing About This Book:<br />Without a doubt, it's the chapter about Jack and Schuyler's first meeting at the Perry Street apartment.  That chapter alone is worth the price of the book!"

771,5,It was great to get this reprint.  The quality was wonderful and I appreciate being able to relive the nostalgia!
772,5,"If you can't imagine dealing with the violent mexican drug cartel, this book will give you a look into their world. Jake Martin, an airline pilot, has inherited millions from his money laundering father. Problem is, he has to find it. Tuco Medrano is also looking for the money, he's a cartel enforcer.<br /><br />A well written book that went with me everywhere! I had to keep reading to see what happens next. The storyline is chilling, both believable and unbelievable, the characters are great (whether you liked or hated them). There's lots of action and suspense. You gotta read it!<br /><br />***I won this book on Goodreads as a first reads giveaway. This is my honest review.***"
773,4,"Perhaps my expectations were too high because this book is from ATK, but I somehow expected it to help me use my pressure cooker like never before. It didn't, but I've been using a pressure cooker for many years. I took a second look at the book trying to picture it as a person new to pressure cooking would see it, and I have to admit that it would be a great guide for someone who is new to (and perhaps even a little afraid of) pressure cookers.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Provides basic information on pressure cooking.<br />- Has reviews of pressure cookers for those looking to buy or replace a pressure cooker.<br />- Has a decent selection of recipes. (It's not ideal for vegans or strict vegetarians.)<br />- It's a beautiful book and would make a nice extra gift to accompany a pressure cooker.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Doesn't seem to appreciate electric pressure cookers.<br />- Sometimes lumps too many things together into neat little charts with categories that are too broad. Seems to me like book layout aesthetics were put ahead of content quality.<br />- I used the rice recipe and ended up with a gloppy mess (I pretty much expected to because of the water to rice ratio, but thought I'd trust ATK - bad choice).<br />- Omits what seems to me (a veggie lover) to be half the known vegetables of the world."

775,3,"Sahar Delijani tells an important story by way of a novel that I found interesting and engaging. Yet, I also found it to be missing the rich details that are integral to the legacies of the inmates of Evin Prison. We just sort of get the general idea that there were a lot of young people summarily imprisoned after Iran's 1979 revolution, because it did not usher in the great changes they had hoped for and who had the courage to protest about it. Yet, Evin's prisoners of conscience come from a wide swath -- religious minorities, ethnic minorities, political activists for a variety of parties -- all with fascinating stories and circumstances that led to their incarceration. In Delijani's telling, the story narrowly focuses on the connection between Iran's youth of the early '80s and their offspring, who, in turn, protested that country's 2008 presidential election, and paid the price with their freedom or their very lives. We get it that Evin's guards and interrogators are nasty and sadistic, but why? I could not help but think of Nien Cheng's \\""Life and Death in Shanghai\\"" or Roxana Saberi's \\""Between Two Worlds\\"" and wish for some of the depth of those two works in Delijani's prose. My hope is that her future stories will begin to bare more of her country's soul, and her own, in her characters' telling of how their lives have been altered by Iran's opportunistic, fearful and superstitious regime."
776,5,Super recording quality...I would recommended this to anyone interested in Celtic spirituality. John O'Donohue is outstanding with his depth of understanding and ability to communicate.
777,5,"This is one of the most heart warming story I've had the honor of reading.  Not only do I know the author but I highly respect her more after reading this piece of her life.  I wish I'd had the pleasure and honor of meeting her brother, who the story is about.  It changed the way I see those with special needs even though I have a niece who has special needs.  Truly a courageous spirit.  I highly recommend this book, if you can find a used copy, get it!<br /><br />On a personal note to the author, Sally, you are an amazing woman and your brother was truly a hero and although I feel as if I know him, through this story, I wish I'd had the honor of meeting him.  Xoxoxo"

782,1,"This is a wonderful book of wisdom  My first copy, that I had ordered several years ago, is printed on white paper.  It's wisdom is why I ordered 3 more to share with friends, BUT the three that I ordered and recently received  most definitely are on pirated paper.  The paper is almost too dark to be able to read. I feel very cheated.  The covers are like the first so, unfortunately, I didn't look inside or I would have returned them before I wrote in them on the inside cover.  I will probably not order anymore from Amazon although this is the first disappointment I have had through the years.  Having to return for such a reason is not worth the effort."
783,5,This is a great funny and very educational read. Jeremy Roenick really has a way of telling a great story that shows the indie life of a hockey player and adds a lot of humor. A great gift for any hockey lover!
784,5,"A wonderful product Innovative Kids has such a terrific set of books for infants to early readers.  I love that the characters are a diverse group from Asian, African American and to girls and boys.  I always hate to see one race, one gender books.  Let kids see what the world looks like from a global perspective.  These are easy to tote along in a diaper bag to the doctor's appointments, to church and in the car on road trips.  For older siblings, it is good practice having them read to their baby brother short books that get them practicing their pronunciation out loud."
785,5,"I appreciate books that seek to clarify misunderstanding and misconception. So often, in the biblical-theological world and otherwise, the proverbial pendulum is swung to the far right or left and a valuable topic and/or perspective is terribly misconstrued, or even lost, in the process. The matter of \\""preparatory grace\\"" is no stranger to the aforementioned. In their new volume, Prepared by Grace, for Grace: The Puritans on God's Ordinary Way of Leading Sinners to Christ (Reformation Heritage Books, 2013), Joel R. Beeke and Paul M. Smalley offer a thorough look at this important subject among an array of Reformed and Puritan theologians.<br /><br />Table of Contents:<br /><br />Introduction: The Question of Preparationism<br /><br />Preparation and Modern Scholarship<br />Precedents to Puritan Preparation: Augustine to Calvin<br />Preparation and Early English Puritans: Perkins, Sibbes, and Preston<br />Preparation for Conversion: William Ames<br />Preparation in Early New England (I): Thomas Hooker<br />Preparation in Early New England (II): Shepard and Pemble<br />Preparation and the Antinomian Controversy: John Cotton<br />Preparation at the Pinnacle of Puritanism: Westminster, Burroughs, and Guthrie<br />Preparation under a Scholastic Lens: Norton<br />Preparation and Later Puritan Critiques: Goodwin and Firmin<br />Later Puritan Preparation: Flavel and Bunyan<br />Jonathan Edwards and Seeking God<br />Continental Reformed Perspectives: Zwingli to Witsius<br />The Grace of Preparation for Faith<br />Appendix: William Ames's Theological Disputation on Preparation<br /><br />I must say at the outset that which is duly noted by Sinclair Ferguson in the foreword, that the authors examining the topic at hand may be characterized as both meticulous scholar and gifted pastor.  Thus their writing is not only academically thorough, but also readable and edifying.<br /><br />In terms of the book's content and structure, Beeke and Smalley begin with a chapter entitled \\""The Question of Preparation.\\"" This chapter lays the groundwork of defining terms and paving the way for the remainder of the book. In their foundational chapter, the authors note that their study will be conducted from the perspective of those that believe firmly that \\""a righteous and holy God saves sinners \\""by grace through faith\\"" (Eph. 2:8)\\"" (p. 1). Thus, the book is designed to address the question of \\""how God ordinarily brings sinners to the point of trusting in Christ alone for salvation\\"" (p. 1).  Being a work that examines God's work in saving sinners, the authors are careful to avoid the terms of \\""preparationism\\"" or \\""preparationist\\"" so as to not confuse their subject with those that would argue for the notion that the human being prepares himself for God's saving activity.<br /><br />The book then moves through Puritan history making mention of a handful of Puritans who both advocated and critiqued certain aspects of \\""preparatory grace\\"".  Notably, the authors deal with Augustine and Calvin who held a high view of God's sovereignty in salvation and how they understood preparatory grace. Additionally, in terms of the Puritan figures who posited a sort of separation from sin via human effort, prior to salvation, the authors expose their errors.<br /><br />For me, while this book is thoroughly readable, for many, much of the content may be quite tedious to work through. The highlights would be the chapters on Calvin/Augustine and particularly \\""Jonathan Edwards and Seeking God\\"".  The final chapter that summarizes the book's findings is immensely helpful as well.  The authors note 8 ways in which the doctrine of Puritan preparation is helpful for the believer to consider:<br /><br />1.) Puritan preparation assists the free offer of the gospel.<br /><br />2.) Puritan preparation is thoroughly Reformed, not Roman Catholic or Arminian.<br /><br />3.) Puritan preparation highlights the common work of the Holy Spirit.<br /><br />4.) Puritan preparation engages sinners withthe law but not legalism.<br /><br />5.) Puritan preparation respects the mystery of regeneration in its timing.<br /><br />6.) Puritan preparation honors God as Creator and Savior.<br /><br />7.) Puritan preparation reveals the sufficiency of Christ.<br /><br />8.) Puritan preparation is biblical.<br /><br />In sum, the Puritans were those who sought to know the Lord with great fervor. Their desire to understand the way in which a holy God saves sinners was far from casual. Studying the way the Puritans understood God's saving activity ought to lead the believer to a greater sense of God's rich grace, a great humility, and a response of praise and worship for God's immense kindness in revealing His Son to underserving sinners. Whenever I read a book by Joel Beeke, I come away with a greater desire to know God in Christ Jesus with the same depth, ardor and sincerity as the Puritans did. Encountering this book was no exception. I recommend it!<br /><br />*A copy of the book was provided by the publisher, at no charge, for the purpose of review.

788,5,I ran across this book by accident and am SO glad that I did. This book thoroughly explains how the thyroid functions and how medications work. I learned a great deal especially about the difference between using a synthetic pill vs a hundred + year old tried natural medication. My children have all been plaqued with a disorder similar to mine so this book has been passed around not only to them but to friends as well. Highly recommended to anyone searching for answers to improve their health.

792,4,"Lene Gammelgaard wants to become the first Danish woman to summit Mount Everest, so when she gets an offer to do so from her friend Scott Fisher - owner of Mountain Madness, a company that provides outfitting and guiding services to climbers - she doesn't hesitate. She has climbed with Scott before, and she believes herself capable of reaching the summit of the world's highest mountain. Lene's varied background (psychotherapist and lawyer, among other things) will make her valuable to Scott as a team member, and Lene knows that's the case.<br /><br />Things don't go perfectly as the oddly assorted group moves through the weeks it takes to get accustomed to the altitude of Everest, get their gear carried up to the higher camps from which the summit assault will be launched, and determine which climbers can attempt that assault. Some succomb to medical problems, and one of the Sherpas - Nepalese tribesmen who for generations have made their living working for and with climbers on the Himalayan peaks - falls mortally sick, despite the Sherpa belief that altitude only affects outsiders. Eventually, though, Lene is among those team members who make it to the top. After which the hardest part of this climb faces her: she has to get down alive. Tragedy strikes when Lene and the other climbers who have summited on this day descend into a sudden storm of blizzard strength.<br /><br />This book was published in Denmark before Jon Krakauer's \\""Into Thin Air\\"" was published in the United States. Krakauer, a professional journalist, was a member of Rob Hall's Adventure Consultants team, which by agreement between the two guides summited on the same day as the Mountain Madness expedition. The sudden storm proved to be a killer. Krakauer's book is one of my favorite pieces of nonfiction, but I've read the other accounts of the same events that expedition members who survived to tell about it have produced. All of them but this one...which gives me one more valuable perspective. I found it very readable, and very honest, too.<br /><br />--Reviewed by Nina M.

796,5,"From the first paragraph it puts you inside the mind of a man--the narrator--who is fleeing the Nazi advance into France in 1939.  He gets to Marseille, where he has to decide whether he wants to try to leave on one of the last ships.  Marseille is claustrophobic.  It offers only boredom, muted terror, and the frenetic but likely senseless activity of convincing bureaucrats to issue visas and tickets to leave.  We wait with the narrator in one dismal café or other where the mistral  blows endlessly outside and you can't get a drink unless it's an \\""alcohol day.\\""<br /><br />Like Humphrey Bogart's character in Casablanca, the narrator is in love with a woman married to another man, but Marseille is no Hollywood movie set.  Thoughts and feelings become unstable, then warp under the strain.  The decision to leave Europe behind forever is not easy.  A family where all except the grandmother have been granted visas refuse to leave even though the grandmother is certain to die within a few months and then all the others will all be interned.  Marie, with whom the narrator has fallen in love, hesitates again and again because she refuses to accept that her husband the novelist Weidel is dead.  The narrator too is confused.  He says he doesn't want to leave, then puts all his energy and cunning into trying to get a transit visa.<br /><br />We know little about the nameless narrator.  He escaped first from a German concentration camp and then from a French work camp, but he does not seem ideological or especially political.  He seems to be an ordinary person who just hates Nazis:  \\""their murderous commands and objectionable insistence on obedience, their disgusting boasts.\\""  For this reason it's not possible to read Transit and think: \\""well, that wouldn't have happened to me back then\\"" or \\""that can never happen to me.\\""  This is one of Seghers' major achievements.<br /><br />One of the most moving moments is when the narrator reads Weidel's unpublished novel.  It's the firstnovel the narrator has ever finished, and the beauty of the prose makes him feel that German is once more his language--the language of his childhood and youth, before the Nazis commandeered and disfigured it.  This may not be what most people think of when they think of Nazi crimes, but for the narrator it is a very real, deeply personal loss.  Perhaps Anna Seghers hoped her novel would reclaim and renew the German language for its first readers in the same way.  Beautifully translated by Margot Bettauer Dembo, this English language version has the same simplicity and strength of feeling as Seghers' original prose."

799,4,"This is a great book in terms of content, but the author must have dictated it and never read it.  You will find ridiculous tipos and grammatical errors on almost every page.  Fortunately, the substance rises above the form, but a decent editor could have cleaned it up pretty easily.  That's why it only gets four stars."
800,5,So as I am sure any reader will tell you that the book to most any movie is sooooo much better and this is once again true for this book.  I bought this book for my mom and she can not put it down.... It takes you on a journey that you are soon not to forget!
801,5,"This book is very helpful to understanding the steps to having a Small Business Entrepreneurship  with Innovation and Marketing.<br />I believe if more small business employers took time to read and comprehend whats in this book, there would be less failures. Mainly because they would understand what to do, before they start-up."
802,5,"This book I read in two days! I loved it. It's written so well, it's as if he's there telling you about his life with Selena. I cried at the end. So touching."
803,5,"This is not the typical introductory book for dowsing.  It have an introductory section to dowsing.  It is biased to L-rods.  That makes sense, since they are the easiest dowsing tool to learn and use.  It discusses pendulums, also, especially for determining percentages.  The author discusses two kinds of dowsing.  Reflective dowsing is the traditional kind, where one gets information.  Projective dowsing is the projection of intent.  Dowsers seem to all move into projective dowsing, eventually.  This has a different perspective, and information I hadn't seen in other books on dowsing.  The section on cleaning out a street drug market, using projective dowsing, was not something I've seen in any book on dowsing.  It does discuss water dowsing, some.  However, it is clear the author is interested in using projective dowsing to improve one's environment.  What I would have wanted to know before I got it is that it had a lot of useful information in it, more than I would have expected."
804,5,"I randomly picked up this book recently and was not disappointed.My past experiences with non-American cozy writers has not always been enjoyable. But I pressed on anyway.I have only this past year begun reading cozies. And I absolutely love them, especially ones like Ms Roberts', with a bit of paranormal thrown in.Storyline was great, characters very credible, locale was great as were the descriptions. Just the right amount of info...no TMI.  :)  The ending was a bit of a surprise...and I won't spoil it for anyone...but especially in my life, it really touched a still very raw nerve....well done Ms. Roberts, well done! I am on to book two in A Ghost Dusters Mystery. Can't wait...."
805,5,"This book could be the model for biographies of the songwriters of<br />old Broadway, with an author who is very knowledgeable but also<br />fine company. He clearly likes and admires his subject, and thus can<br />lead the reader into Lorenz Hart's world almost as Nick Carraway tells<br />his readers about Jay Gatsby. There are a lot of good biographies in<br />this field, but this is one of the best."
806,5,"Great book, perfect condition, prompt and translucent service and delivery.<br /><br />The book is a great inspiration and packed with loads of fun delicious and easy to follow recipes.<br /><br />Lots of general tips as well."
807,4,"Ellen Schecter is a woman with great strength of character and fortitude. Her courage to overcome the adversities of her ill health are heart rendering. As you read her personal story, you are secretly cheering her on. Faced with road blocks at almost every turn, Mrs. Schecter's perserverence will definitely win you over."
808,5,"Got this to give to my mom for mother's day, since she is taking care of my baby, and she loves it!"
809,5,AS USUAL I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE RECIPIES IN THIS BOOK. BRINGS ME BACK TO EARLIER TIMES OF GOOD HOME MADE FAMILY STYLE COOKING!
810,5,This book has been extremely helpful in understanding what we need and what we can expect to pay. I would recommend this book to anyone expecting.
811,5,"The Summer of Love has been romanticized by many, in hundreds of books and films of the 60's, but in 'After The Wanders', Cannistraro allows us to relive it, in a truly wonderful, non-romanticized, 'warts and all' LSD trip. In marked contrast to the literary, well trodden, flower power nostalgia of Haight-Ashbury, Carnaby Street and Woodstock, Cannistraro sets his turf in the mean streets of the Bronx.<br /><br />At times poignant, and at times laugh out loud funny, this lush chronicle of coming of age, in the Age of Aquarius, is set against the background of urban strife, racial tensions, anti-war protests and raging hormones, literally on drugs.  And like the times, his main character's journey is part acid trip, part rock 'n roll concert and part free love. With a couple of rumbles, scams and the funniest wedding I have ever read about in print. Denoted with sage lyrics from the music of that time, those words become the poetry and headlines to not only the content of the book but of the decade the story is set in.  In all, a gripping read that spans generations by shamelessly reveling in our basic need to feed our human desires.  - I'm Tom Avitabile, I am an author and I loved this book!"
812,5,all three of these books in this serious is epic. loved them all and i definently recommened them to absolutley everybody &#34;of proper age of course lol&#34;
813,5,"I would suggest every Divorce Lawyer and Judge read a copy of this book.<br /><br />Living with an alienating parent is continual exposure to emotionally charged situations where the child is in an environment where there are a lot of expressions of anger and hostility towards the targeted parent. That negative energy is contagious. The child picks up on that energy. This is the breeding ground for depression, feelings of rejection, and poor self-esteem in the child, all emanating from the negativity that is in the alienating parent's home.<br /><br />PAS is very real; it is very valid; and it is very well documented. The phenomenon admittedly needs more research and discussion; there is no doubt about it. Our focus should, however, should be on the harm PAS does to children, especially when they lose their relationship with a loving parent. In fact when PAS is not acknowledged it can be life-threatening.<br /><br />There are very few books out there discussing this major issue that almost 50% now of all children now find themselves caught between and made to suffer through these traumatic adult head games.<br /><br />Children caught in the middle of two people who can't work their problems out in a civil and adult manner in order to spare their offspring issues that will follow them phychologically into adulthood and even onto the next generation if not addressed.<br /><br />UNJUST: When your granddaughter, whose father raised her as a infant, mother divorced father but told child father left them (lied) which is parental alienation.<br /><br />UNJUST: When the parent will not allow any gift exchanged between the child, father or paternal grandparents.<br /><br />UNJUST: When the court awards a child with a cell phone with only three numbers programmed in, mom, dad and grandma & grandpa.

814,5,"As a baby-boomer wanting to age gracefully, though not too quickly, Be You-T-Full gave me lots of tips for looking my best. I was surprised to learn just how little I knew about the different products & procedures that are available. This book explained the many options so clearly, including their realistic results, down-time, & approximate pricing. It's a great reference for anyone considering botox, laser treatments, and/or other non-surgical improvements."
815,3,Bought it used..... it was definitely used but no serious damage.  Good for reference and will keep in the &#34;look-up&#34; library.
816,5,"An assignment for a college level course required me to choose a nonfiction book that would not only capture my attention, but hold it. Least to say, choosing to read about serial killers was a bold choice. On one end, while reading about the madness and drive behind certain cases can be fascinating, the style of writing and descriptions can turn a good read into a bad one. Picking up \\""Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters\\"" was a bold choice, but reading the first sentence helped me realize it was a wise one.<br /><br />Peter Vronsky opens each chapter with a quote that not only asserts his beliefs as he writes, but adds a little humor here and there. The beginning section opens with Vronsky describing his encounters with two different serial killers. More so than making it seem as if he knew all along what the killers were doing and were capable of, Vronsky places you in his shoes. He lets you experience his life and fear when he finds out he has spoken to a person of mass destruction. How you can resist a story that places you in its midst? You can't.<br /><br />From there Vronsky mentions a few known and unknown serial killers ranging from Ted Bundy to Son of Sam. He doesn't explain their method of killing and move on to the next. He offers logic and data behind the murders one probably didn't consider or known about. He also helps the reader see that a serial killer isn't a mad man, chanting spirit's names and rocking back and forth in public. More than likely, they're normal people living normal lives that have a different streak or nerve inside of them. Vronsky even adds a bit of humor in his descriptions by explaining the normal daily things they did, then adding a random line in the mix that says \\""oh, and they killed such and such amount of people.\\"" It comes as a shocker, yet it flows so nicely.<br /><br />Vronsky's story is a work of magic I recommend to anyone interested in the background of serial killers. It's a different read. But it makesfor an interesting one."
817,5,"This book had action, adventure, information relating to Native American tribes and Mountain Man jargon. Living in the 1800's was difficult and dangerous to say the least. After reading this book, I am more knowledgeable as to the various Native American tribes who lived in the West. I am also more knowledgeable as to the way of the Mountain Man and how they survived the elements and the Indians. And, I believe I could set a trap line and take me a mess of Plew!"
818,1,Not an interesting book or diet in any way. Quite impossible to follow. This one goes to the yard sale.
819,5,"A beautifully inspiring book filled with the life experiences of the artist Beatrice Wood. She set out to live life to it's fullest and that is exactly what she did, living through good times and bad times. Along the way she enjoyed the company of many famous artists and art collectors of her time. As a result of those relationships her life as an artist was enriched. For better or for worse she lived an exciting life that was self directed by her perseverance and courage. She was a vital artist, a spiritual soul and an intelligent human being."
820,3,"PROBABLY A GREAT BOOK, BUT I FOUND THAT THE OFFICE FOR SPREADSHEETS AND WORD WOULD SUFFICE AT LEAST FOR NOW. MAY PURCHASE AT A LATER TIME."
821,5,"To how and why tickets are not available 10 seconds after they are officially on sale, AND MORE!!!  Well written and thoroughly researched book that was incredibly interesting and informative.  If you are interested in this topic then this book will not disappoint."
822,5,"The 1970's, as the author adroitly points out, were the first generation of true professionals.  There were no guidelines to teach the over-reachers how to behave, what to say in an interview, how to push humility.<br /><br />This brought a generation of vivid characters who pushed the limits of behavior to cartoonishness.  Not to say these were not phenomenal players and the matches were not epic.  Short of the current triumvirate of Federer, Djokovic, and Nadal, the inhabitatants of this era may have been the best of all time.<br /><br />There was the sphinx-like Bjorn Borg, beloved by men fans and women fans equally, if not exactly.  There was the raw brilliance on the court, and the raw emotional behavior of John McEnroe, and the feisty, obnoxious, street brawling of Jimmy Connors.  There was a cast of characters competing, like bad boy Ilie Nastase, and the ill-fated perennial runner up Vitas Gerulaitas constantly circling the front runners.<br /><br />It made for dramatic tennis, great copy, but sometimes very ugly on court antics.<br /><br />Borg, ultimately, was the only player on the tour McEnroe truly respected, and this elevated his game to its highest levels.<br /><br />The author, Stephen Tignor, writes in a clear, concise manner, but has some deep insights into the psyches of these seminal players of their generation. He has an understanding of tennis history, and these players places in this hierarchy.<br /><br />Thoroughly recommended read for the tennis fan and/or historian."
823,5,"Having studied U.S. presidencies over the years, I've always taken an interest in Calvin Coolidge and his ties to New England and Massachusetts. This volume on Calvin Coolidge by Amity Shlaes is one of the most well crafted biographies of Silent Cal I've read.<br />Ms. Shlaes' integration of the biographical history of the man woven with the economic development of the nineteen-twenties illustrates a new perspective of a very under rated, if not forgotten president. Must read."
824,5,"This book served the purpose of being a \\""carry around\\"" small helpful guide for the camera.  David Busch other book was larger and more detailed; however, this smaller version is more useful."
825,5,"It is a very fair evaluation of the European Union. Unfortunately the subject can be rather dry, but the author broke it down really well."
826,5,"I read the first book and was so good and then I read this one and the Gage boys are off the chain, I do not know what else the Author can do to add more intrique, I was already up all night reading this book and can not wait until book 3, I am not gonna tell to much, I did in my review with Book 1 but you have to buy the book to get the full awesome read....."
827,5,"I'd give this book 4.5 stars.<br /><br />Difficult Conversations is a must-read for anyone who deals with human interaction as part of their profession, and especially for people in the social sciences or who are in a setting where they are likely to negotiate often. I also think any spouses or parents really ought to give it a read, as it walks you through the thicket of having those discussions that are uncomfortable, painful, awkward, or downright impossible. It breaks things down and gives great examples that keep things understandable and applicable across myriad circumstances. It's useful in working through partner relationships, parent-child relationships (especially with teens), employer-employee relationships, landlord-tenant relationships, and really anything else. My only complaint is that at times it got pretty dry and boring, and I don't think it had to be."
828,5,Its the perfect size. The scriptures are categorized for quick reference and edification. Would recommend to new believers in Christ and Christians evangelizing to the unbelievers.
829,5,"Great read for anyone who has been (and who hasn't been?) offended by our corporate culture of depersonalization and greed.<br />We can all relate to the little guy, be outraged and uplifted at the same time!"
830,4,"As essentially a \\""picture book,\\"" the title really does well here. Just over 300 pages long, each one a glossy full color page containing a full spread of a picture. The pictures themselves are stunning, both in printing and photographing - great color, saturation, framing, and overall composition. Paper weight is substantial, making the piece more of a coffee table book than something you'd sit in bed with. Somewhat chronologically arranged, starting with the earliest models, and moving through in chapters according to \\""erras,\\"" some of which overlap in years, to the modern day variants. Almost all pictures contain years and model designations, with some showcasing brief model specifications, such as engine, transmission, production, etc. The break in pages on the two-page spreads somewhat detracts from the viewing, but not much you can really do with that.<br /><br />The text is really the low point of the book for me. What little text there is present is repeated in several languages, throughout most of the book. A short forward, and a small paragraph introducing each chapter is essentially the only information provided. No details on the history of each model, particular artwork / branding of the car, etc. Just a year, model, and a few sentences on what the particular era the chapter is based around. I understand providing a history lesson wasn't the main purpose of this book, but it would still have been nice to have a little background to accompany the stunning photographs.<br /><br />Overall rather happy with the purchase; worth the price in my opinion. Definitely a book that will actually get picked up and flipped through for some time to come, and not just collect dust on some shelf. Great to show someone the progression of the brand, or as a conversation piece with company."
831,5,"and Atlas Shrugged in particular.  In fact, I am re-reading it right now.  this was a present for a high school graduate - get to them early!"
832,5,"Indian mythology's long awaited debut on mainstream bookshelves is here. I may have been a late entrant to this, but I am glad that someone of Amish's intellect and passion was chosen to pen this &#34;treatise&#34;. Must read for the masses and the illuminati alike. An LOTR like movie franchise would be very welcome if well made."
833,5,"The Eternity Cure is ten times better than \\""The Immortal Rules.\\"" This book is everything that that I was looking for when I picked up book one of the \\""Blood of Eden\\"" series. It is action packed, filled with drama and more importantly gives us the much desired look into Kagawa's vampire world. I enjoyed this immensely. I quite literally could not put it down.<br /><br />It has been four months since Allison Sekemoto left Eden and the boy she could have loved behind, in order to look for her sire, Kanin. It's been a long and lonely road, but Allison knows that she is close. She can still feel the torment that the insane Sarren is putting Kanin through and she just hopes that her sire can hold on until she can get to him. Along the way she finds new friends and old enemies. Allison joins forces with unlikely allies and goes on a journey to save Kanin and find the cure for the new strain of the red lung virus.<br /><br />Since this is a series, I knew that most of the characters from the original book would return, but I had no idea how Kagawa would pull it off. Answer, brilliantly. I enjoyed the reemergence of friends and foes. It was interesting to see relationships complicate and the story move through layers of complexity and conflict.<br /><br />I spent a lot of time just being concerned about the welfare and fate of the main characters. It's probably, because Kagawa proved with \\""The Immortal Rules\\"" that she is willing to kill off characters and leave Allison alone. Characters that I was ambivalent about or even hated in book one became important to me. I wanted everyone to be ok. I wanted everyone to just sit in a room and be safe. Fortunately, I did not write this book, because obviously safe characters don't star in very good books.<br /><br /> I really can't gush enough about the amazing work the author did with character development. The characters evolve, mold and communicate on a whole new level. I actually believed the romance between Zeke and Allison, whenin book one I could barely stomach them together. We learn a lot of Kanin's secrets in this book, but somehow he remains as enigmatic and mysterious as ever. I want to know everything about him. I want to know why he decided to risk himself to save the humans and why, even though he has so much self-loathing, he continues to fight for his life.  He's a walking contradictions and I love figuring those kinds of characters out.<br /><br />The villains are still extremely weak or insanely evil and I love to hate them. Literally, I caught myself yelling obscenities at people who could not respond, because they are not real!<br /><br />This book is a wild ride. Truly and completely.  It is jammed with conflicts, adventure, life and death situations and of course romance. The ending left me gasping for air. It was filled with so much hope and yet so much despair and heartache. Really, how much can this girl take? She's a vampire, she's immortal and a great fighter, but she's still just a teenage girl with the world on her shoulders.<br /><br />My final thoughts about this book are.... next book please!<br /><br />Recommended for fans of Julie Kagawa, readers of urban fantasy and people who love some YA romance."
834,5,"I was totally amazed at the depth and knowledge in this book and finished it in two days.  Leah is the granddaughter of my neighbors who I have met a few times.  She is a wonderful, sweet young woman and very mature for her years.  I could not believe she began this book at such a young age and am anxious for her next one!!!!  Good job Leah!!!!!"
835,5,"I don't have to write much. I can't even imagine a reason why someone would read the reviews for this book. If you read Part I: Shadow & Claw, then you either hate the series or love it. I have never heard of anyone reading The Book of the New Sun and saying &#34;Eh. It was alright. Maybe I'll read the second one, maybe not&#34;. If you loved part I, then buy part two, reread part one while waiting for part two, then read part two."
836,4,I always like Linda Schotts books.  She is a great inspirational writer that challenges one in their daily Christian walk.
837,4,This was a very enjoyable read. I had not heard of Joy Argento before encountering her on a list of new attendees of the<br />Golden Crown Literary Society; so this was a happy discovery. I look forward to reading her other novels.
838,5,A wonderful guide on how to date and follow God's will for our lives. This book is fitting for All Christian women.
839,5,"I enjoyed the alternate earth/moon world that McGill has created.  There are the different monsters that he's brought to life, as well as the history that he has given to his world.  I even was drawn into the future earth and moon colony that he has created as well.<br />I also liked the characters.  I was drawn into seeing how the kids reacted to their new world and their new chance on life. I didn't always like their choices, but they were the characters choices and they stuck by them.  For example I didn't like the way that the kids seemed to ignore that one of their own was dying.  But it made sense in a way since they were from a world where people died all the time and no one cared.  So it would make sense if it had desensitized them just a little.<br />The story was also interesting.  There was just enough mystery to keep the reader interested without the mystery becoming annoying.  The story is also filled with lots of action, adventure and comedy.  Overall I think it is a fun read that can be enjoyed by adults as well as kids.<br />A lot of my readers lately have been asking for age ranges on books. This one I think is good for midgrade on up.  There are some heavier spots to the story, for example the Geneva virus and the devastation it has caused, but nothing overly dark or to heavy materiel wise.  However I always recommend that a parent read through a book before just blithely handing it over to a child.  You never know when there is going to be something that you might not be comfortable with them reading."
840,5,"I love it because it hast all the element that i am always looking in a a writen novel, so i Love it that s it and I am only waiting for the next book. love it."
841,5,"great and easy read, you have to get the series<br />if possible, item in great condition, better than description<br />recommend to all<br />thanks"
842,5,"POSTMORTEM by Patricia Cornwell stands the test of time. Although this book was released in 1990 it is a fabulous read. Read and enjoy it and then get the audiobook to go with it and it will enhance the whole experience. I am so lucky that I am starting now and can read each book in sequence and enjoy how Dr. Kay Scarpetta grows in her relationships with her niece Lucy, with her love interests and her forensic team as they move through the decades of forensic technology and science. You will not be dissappointed with this book if you like mystery and a very talented writer. Enjoy."
843,5,"I bought Sons of God because I am a big fan of Zen Garcia's radio show, [...] I found the show on blogtalkradio while I was researching Halo of the Nephilim, my horror sequel about a fallen angel and the nephilim who he fathers.  One episode later, I was hooked.  Fallen Angels is one of my favorite radio shows.  Zen educates his listeners with very intellectual, well-researched, and fascinating Bible related topics.  His studies are not conventional, but add more mystery and insight to God's word.  Sons of God expands his radio teachings.  Zen constantly interprets scripture and other writings while including primary sources for the reader.  Like most Christians, I am well aware of the Bible, Enoch, Jubilees, other gospels, and letters to and from the disciples that did not make the cut into the Bible, but Zen provides a wealth of resources that were foreign to me.  Have you heard of these writings?  Love to hear your comment:    Kolbrin Bible    The Vitae of Adam and Eve  The First Book of Adam and Eve  Hypostasis of the Archons  Testament of Amram  Emerald Tablets  Nag Hammadi Codices (I heard of them through Zen from his radio show)  Trimorphic Protennoia    Pistis Sophia    Book of Bee  Kebra Nagast  The Apocryphon of John  On the Origin of the World  Baruch  Cave of Treasure  Lost Book of Enki  Babylonian Creation Tale  The Gospel of the Secret Supper  The Book of Giants  Sibylline Oracles    Sons of God explores the falls of man, Satan, and the Watchers.  Zen states Adam was created twice on the sixth day of Creation.  His soul held dominion over one-third of Heaven.  God wanted Satan to bow down to Adam.  Believing Adam to be his inferior, Satan refused.  He convinced one-third of the angels to rebel.  We all know the rest of the story, or do we?  Zen prolifically writes about Satan's transformation from angel to alien, dragon, and reptilian.  Satan first appears in the Garden of Eden as a serpent.    Ancient Quetzlcoatl    Without giving the book away, one of the many interesting things that I wanted to share is the word seraph.  In Sanskrit it means reptile.  Seraphim (plural) mean angels, burning ones, nachash (serpent), and/or shining Enchanter.  Zen states that this serpent might have had wings and connects it with the Quetzlcoatl and Kulkulcan.  Satan's third of rebel angels are seraphim.  Back to the story of Adam and Eve... Zen's studies suggest that Satan either seduces Eve (fruit is a metaphor) or rapes her.  She gets pregnant with Cain, the world's first nephilim.  In the Bible, nephilim are described as giants.  More women and angels breed once the Watchers descend to earth and take them as their wives.  The Flood wipes them out, but they are not gone for good.    Giant skeletons are found all over the world.    Besides extensive study on Adam and Eve, Zen also writes about a Niburu connection with reptilian aliens coming to earth for gold.  Other connections include a Satanic bloodline that pervades throughout Europe, including royalty, Vikings, and Illuminati.  He even weaves Atlantis into his studies.  My Review:  This book took me a long time to read.  It's a ton of information to digest-not exactly a light read for a day at the beach.  I took away a vat of knowledge.  Zen leaves no stone unturned, proving to be a leading scholar in esoteric writings.  I can't imagine the time it took him to put this together in a coherent format for layman to read.  Although I don't agree with everything in the book, I really enjoyed learning about these kinds of topics.  Sons of God is highly recommended as a resource for anyone interested in ancient alien theory, angels, and other religious texts.  5/5 Stars  Dina Rae, author"
844,5,The emotionally gripping story of Fable and Drew continues in this sequel to One Week Girlfriend. I couldn't wait to get it on my Kindle after finishing the first book and it did not disappoint. Fable and Drew continue to evolve and grow as individuals and as a couple. The story grabs and pulls you in just as much as the previous book.
845,5,"Once again, I am transported back in time to the beginning of the Roman Empire.  The stakes have never been higher - with the final battle between Anthony and Octavian for First Man of Rome position is coming closer and closer. Titus must know make a decision regarding himself, his woman, his friends and his beloved 10th Legion.  Then there is Cleopatra who is working behind the scenes on her own ambitions. Once again, the characters come alive for me in this book.  We see Titus, Anthony, Octavian, Cleoptra, Scribonius and others as individuals who have weakness, worries, sorrows, courage and fears. Follow the course of history as it has never been told before - by a Legionary of Rome. I have enjoyed this book so much, I have both the paperback version and the e-book."
846,5,"*****<br />This is the second Tenzing Norbu mystery about a Buddhist ex-monk and ex-LAPD police officer turned detective, but it stands alone; if you haven't read the first in this series you will still enjoy this one. I wondered how someone who loves peace and calmness and meditation could possibly be a gun-loving private eye, and this is part of the fun of this book. Tenzing's character is someone the reader grows to love, and in my case, identify with too.<br /><br />The Buddhist principles are subtle, woven into Tenzing's life. It helps you to see how anyone can integrate mindfulness into their life. I also enjoy this better than a movie because in the book, you can read Tenzing's thoughts, and see what goes on inside his head easier. The book is also really funny with great characters.<br /><br />This particular mystery focuses on Tenzing's second rule, which is about how our unconscious beliefs keep us from seeing reality as it is--they are familiar and seem to keep us safe but in reality they can mislead and endanger us; thus we need to challenge these unconscious beliefs and release them. Tenzing makes peace with his past as he solves the mystery that the book is about. It involves mysterious deaths, a search for a Holocaust survivor, a drug cartel, and many twists and turns.<br /><br />I normally don't read mysteries often, but this one really kept my interest because of the wonderful characters and the interesting focus on mindfulness.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****"
847,4,I am not much of a reader but I need to read this.she seems to have alot of knowledge on this subject
848,5,This is one of the best books on understanding and dealing with a person with Borderline Personality disorder. It covers almost everything that is known about this disorder with a lot of empathy and understanding. I would highly recommend this book especially for people who are beyond the stage of grief and anger and are ready to deal with the borderline in their lives in a compassionate manner.
849,1,"After reading one of the most cravenly dishonest, politically left-wing introductions to a book purporting to aide in Christian meditation and prayer I could not possibly have continued on reading the book.  Jesus Christ refused to allow himself to be used for political purposes but sadly there have been and, I suppose always will be, those who,like this author, insist upon injecting their--not His--views into Christianity.<br /><br />If it were possible to have given minus ten stars to this book I would have. It is going into the trash where it belongs."
850,5,I found Time to Tangle with Color more a resource to inspire creativity than anything. Which is what a how to draw books should do. I enjoyed it very much.<br />Teresa J. Reasor
851,5,"&#34;I just love these zombie detective books! They're so funny with the major mysteries and the little minor mysteries that Dan Chambeaux, the zombie detective, tries to solve! There is just so much going on! Dan is hired by the self-proclaimed ghost of Shakespeare to find out who was responsible for the arson which destroyed his stage and props. The most likely suspect is a Senator who is vehemently against unnaturals and is trying to pass the Unnatural Acts Act, which is aimed at making life (such as it is) intolerable for the &#34;monsters.&#34; There is also the possibility that organized crime is trying to gain a foothold in the Unnatural Quarter. I really enjoy the humor in these books, and one of the parts that stands out in my mind is the vampire pianist decked out in a glittering outfit a la Liberace who declares that his outfit is so shiny because he belongs to the minority that believe that vampires should sparkle! A very fun read, and I can't wait for the next one!<br /><br />&#34;"
852,4,"Feisty relentless heroine and reluctant sidelined MI5 hero play off each other beautifully. Grand adventure. Unbelievably good luck but then it's fictional, fun, and romance. I enjoy Chery's books and this one was right at the top of the heap. (Afterglow is my favorite to-date). Thanks Cherry for a colorful ride through Egypt and international thievery. It was a trip I will remember."
853,2,the package arrived a little later than i though it would but it was immaculate and still have plenty of time to get organized for the performance.<br />why is inside the us longer than from across the ocean
854,5,"easter bunny is bringing this book for my son easter sunday, seemed appropriate with the title and all.  I am sure he will enjoy it<br />update he really liked he book"
855,5,"This is a must read! It's really nice to know people living out their faith. This book is not a book that is about the next great theology; nor is it a book that states any new doctrine. The issue with our church generation, especially in America, is that Christianity has become just another belief, but in reality, Christianity is about a radical call that has been forgotten. This book brings that forgotten call. I am not going to spoil that call, you should really pick it up and read it for yourself!<br /><br />Another very encouraging is fond in the forward; every proceed that this book receives goes directly to supporting orphanages and feeding the hungry. Even if you don't like to read, buy this book to help another out!"
856,5,"I read these in order so yes, I have read the previous books and this was as delicious as expected, maybe a little predictable because after all these years I do get conditioned to the formula used but never the less, when I'm in the mood for a Fluke, nothing else will do! Best part was the ending of course, It actually made me speak out loud, shouting something like \\""no way!\\"" which only made waiting to read the next book harder, perhaps that's why I didn't...<br /><br />We get the usual baking, sleuthing, Moishe troubles set in a cozy setting, but the most important and juiciest part was Hannah and Norman and the third wheel. I know she will probably never settle down ( cant force yourself to be attracted to Norman) but reading about it is sure fun, besides the woman is in her twenties ( although she sounds more mature) and who says she needs to settle down like an ancient piece of furniture, bogus hogwash... anyways, there were a few parts that annoyed me ( Hannah suggesting that certain someone marries someone else because of a certain thing) which brought the book back to 10000 BC to me.. Other than that I loved it, the mystery was a little cleverer this time but I was still able to nudge most of the truth myself and the food, yumm.... I like how she includes savory and sweet things, I have tried a few over the years and they were very tasty, cozy home style things...<br /><br />- Kasia S."
857,4,"Vector Prime is not the best book in the New Jedi Order. There, it had to be said. However with that said, understand that the New Jedi order if rife with extremely high caliber books, and compared to the average Star Wars book, Vector Prime is pretty damn solid.<br /><br />More importantly, one must read it to start the New Jedi Order, a series that is well worth starting, not only for Star Wars fans, but fans of Sci Fi or even intense character plots in general.<br /><br />R.A. Salvatore is right at home in action sequences, befitting his Forgotten Realms roots, and does a passable jobs introducing a new generation to the Solo kids, and the new crop of Jedi Knights. Likewise, his intro of the Yuzzhan Vong is subtle enough to make their true nature unknown even after many interactions throughout the book.<br /><br />Vector Prime is not going to blow your socks off, but the later books in NJO will, and Vector Prime is 100% necessary to read the series. Enjoy the relative calm of the first two thirds of the book, but do not let it lull you into a false sense of security, it is the first bookend to the best literature of Star Wars (yes, I say that even after reading Zahn and Anderson)."
858,1,"A very OUTDATED book, with little in the way of information for someone wanting to start a cleaning business. Unless you are completely clueless how to clean. Not useful really for a cleaner today."
859,5,"I purchased this book because I am new to Windows 8 and had no idea how to do anything. I'm in my retirement years, so computers are still a bit intimidating to me, but this book made things so simple.  There are so many pictures with simple instructions that even I could follow. Now I can email my family and see all the pictures of my grandchildren with a few clicks. Thank you so much to the author!"
860,5,Came fast and new I buy these every year since 1985 when I started running and have found this one to be the best for all my need even if now I don't run the distances I use to.
861,4,"Restaurants of New York<br />Liked this one.<br /><br />Did  not like Restaurants of San Fran cisco.  No recipies, and too much money for it.<br /><br />I wonder why you didn't ask me about the San Fran Cisco book."
862,4,Very helpfull and entertaining also very easy to read for people who want to know more about prepping and WTSHTF
863,5,"This bird bingo game is a hit in our family.  My boys love it.  I would suggest a regular bingo game also, just to increase number proficiency."
864,5,This is a really cute story about a little boy who isn't sure about taking his teddy bear to a sleep over. Having the CD made it a great listening center for my students.
865,5,I am simply joining in with the many positive reviews already posted.  This book is the most helpful I have found on the topic of depression. I highly recommend it to anyone who's suffering or knows someone who is.
866,5,This book is great for married and engaged couples. It's very enlightening and helps you understand a man's needs and a woman needs that need to be satisfied in a marriage. All couples should read it.
867,5,"This is a great book for anyone who is aging, has a loved one who is aging, or expects some day to be aging him/herself!  It is full of practical tips to help people stay in their homes comfortably for as long as possible. While there are tips in areas you might expect, such as accessibility and safety, you will also find information on less expected topics, for example, how to promote good nutrition in spite of a declining sense of taste.  Best of all, the book is readable and even amusing at times.  It is an invaluable handbook in this era of aging boomers.  Highly recommended."
868,5,You can use your intelligenc to follow Glidden's journey and her questions.  It is the kindest and most hopeful thing I have read about the dread Israeli/Palestinian issue.
869,5,"What an excellent thriller!  I have read several of the Myron Bolitar novels but have yet to read one of the stand-alone novels.  I think this was a great one to start with.  The characters and the suspense were first-rate.<br /><br />This novel has multiple plots that all have a common thread and it is up to the reader to figure out what is going on.  The main story centers around the Baye family, as parents Mike and Tia have just made one of the most difficult decisions of their life and have decided to spy on their sixteen year old son.  Their son Adam has been acting differently every since the suicide of one of his closest friends and they are so worried about the bad influences that have entered his life that they have decided to download a spyware application and spy on their son.  Not too long after that Adam disappears and they must use the clues from his computer to find him.  Several other stories that involve a feud between a student's father and teacher, a conspiracy involving drugs, a very sick child who needs help and not to mention a psychotic killer on a rampage are all involved in the gripping story that is leaves you wanting more.<br /><br />This was a truly gripping story that I found to be top notch.  I have heard reviews that mention that the fact that all the stories coming together at the end seemed to be a bit of a stretch.  I certainly understand that opinion but I would say that considering a lot of it took place in a small community and everyone knows everyone, I didn't think it was as big of a stretch as others did.  To me this novel ranks right up there with the Bolitar series which to me is the highest compliment one can give.<br /><br />Grade A+"
870,5,It contaions very much interesting information and the abundant art is just really nice. I consider it a collector's item.
871,5,"I discovered Brian's works with The Painted Darkness, a highly celebrated novel that took its readers on a literary ride.  I dug into his catalog and found Blue November Storms and Black Fire to be much of the same, novel length works that are great, engaging, and aren't the type of hit you in the mouth writing, but makes you feel the characters, and the situations.  The writing style that Brian has puts him up there with the best in the business.<br /><br />This continues on with Brian's short story collection, More Than Midnight.  Within you find five stories of horror nature (What They Left Behind, The Final Lesson, Among Us, Pulled Into Darkness, Answering the Call) that do just what his novels do, but in short story form.  A nice bonus to this hardcover, is that it's signed by Brian himself, along with Michael Koryta who does the introduction, and Glenn Chadbourne who illustrated the cover."
872,2,This is another book that was whatever to me. I think it has great potential but it did not appeal to me.
873,5,"I am finishing week 4, and I am down 14 pounds. :) I think this is the best diet, ever!"
874,4,"This is not an easy read, but it is well worth the effort.  I find Pelton's ideas about the construction of the physical universe very interesting.  His analysis of the purpose of free will and the psychological makeup of the human being is fascinating.  These two make a convincing argument for the presence of an intelligent and loving creator of the universe.  However, when Pelton applies quotes from the Bible to his arguments, his Biblical scholarship lacks the same objective distance that his views on science have. What he proposes from the Bible is much more faith based than objective.  It does not make sense to me that a wise and loving creator of all things would limit his revelation to one person and thereby require belief in that one person.  If you like books that make you think, this is one you will want to read."
875,4,"I loved this fantasy story by Maria Schneider. The plot is complex and very interesting, the characters are well-rounded and the world that has been created is fascinating. A must-read for fantasy buffs. I am definitely going to read more stories by this author. The first story in, I hope, a long series of imaginative books."
876,4,This is the first book in this series that I've read. It had a good plot and great characters. The author could have given more description about what the characters looked like so I could have a better picture in my head. I like to &#34;see&#34; characters as I read.
877,5,"Ms. Miller's new book was profoundly enlightening in a number of ways.  She gives state of the art advice on how to approach potential employers and executive recruiters.  Her writing style is straightforward and she provides a ready road map for success.  Just how successful? We'll see about that, but I've had two interviews this week just by following through on her advice."
878,4,"Book was as described, only problem was that it took longer than expected to arrive. That is why im giving it a four star rating."
879,5,"This book does the thing that I always want a thriller to do--It makes me feel like I am constantly on the verge of figuring out where the story is going, but then the twists and turns foil my every effort to anticipate the story enough times that I am staying up late, turning page after page to see what will happen.<br /><br />The setting at a small, quiet college near an abandoned insane asylum creates just the right atmosphere for this gripping story. The characters are well-drawn, and because the protagonist Helen is a newcomer to town, Helen and the reader are right there together trying to figure out this cast of characters and the situation surrounding the legs found zip-tied to the train tracks.<br /><br />I don't want to give anything away. Suffice to say that if you like thrillers, especially thrillers that are both sexy and deeply messed-up, you will love this. I am already anxiously waiting for the next book in this series."
880,5,"I loved everything about the book and the shipment, service, price, packaging. Everything was perfect. Looking forward to the other two books."
881,5,"Received this as a gift last year.  Loved it so much, I got another one for this year!  Very funny, sarcastic, dry wit."
882,5,"I have purchased two copies of this book -- one as a gift the expensive way through Amazon and a much cheaper way from Charles Poliquin's website:  [...] ---$12.95 plus shipping.<br />That said, I have three books  that I consider 5-star when it comes to learning what their is to know about building arms with weight training. The first is TARGET BODYBUILDING by Per Tesch. There are three muscles in the upper arm -- the Biceps brachii, the Brachialis, and the Triceps brachii. The Biceps has two heads and the Triceps has three heads. There are several popular exercises for each muscle, but not every exercise taxes all the heads equally. Several exercises have little efffect on one or more of the heads. TARGET BODYBUILDING uses MRI's to identify how much each head is affected by each exercise. In this way one can select exercises that will ensure complete development as well as reducing the number of redundant exercises. TARGET BODYBUILDING is no longer in print, but ,thanks to Amazon, used copies can be acquired at bargain prices.<br />Here are some terms used in titles of the 57 sections which Poliquin uses to describe the 57 methods:<br />goals, technique,  loading parameters,methods, nutrition, support, dumbbell work, agonist/antagonist, most effective exercises first, speed of Biceps brachii exercises, seated vs. standing exercises, cocking your wrist, thick bar training, place for unilateral training, Brachialis training, feeling an exercise, \\""most bang for yor buck exercises\\"", body position, speed of contraction, tempo of eccentric contractions, last slow rep trick, cluster training, rest intervals, back-off set, modifeid Hepburn method, strength building, chin-ups, 100-rep method, pre-exhaustion, post-exhaustion, twice a day, lateral head of triceps, triceps mass routine, Jachere arm training, functional isometrics, post tetanic facilitation [ AKA Post Activation Potentiation or PAP], F/I supersets, one day cure, isometric stops, uni-angular tri-set variation,pre-workout stack, BCAA's, Yin stack, post workout recovery, verify neck alignment, verify soft-tissue alignment, trap development, a quick way to monitor overtraining, how to train your grip, role of Olympic lifting, forearm training, OTC compound for quicker recovery, partial range training. I have shortened, paraphrased, and in other ways altered some of the titles of the section headings so as not to give too much away, but you can see Poliquin covers a lot of ground -- enough to provide a lot of variety for several months/years of arm training. The book itself is printed on high quality glossy paper and there is an abundance of color photos that illustrate how to perform the exercises, some of the special equipment he mentions, and so on.<br />Be warned that much of this is book is suitable for advanced trainees. Most beginners would be ill-advised not to jump into many of the advanced techniques although certainly topics such as exercise tempo are applicable to all trainees.<br />Not everyone agrees with Charles Poliquin, I came across a commentary/response to Poliquin by Bret Contreras on youtube. My advice in the matters of disagreement between gurus is to be as amused as possible and if you can come away with what you think is a more informed point of view, that's blessing.<br />One thing I always look for in weight training manuals are precautions to avoid injury and the possibility of being injured or killed by advice within the book. I wish that Poliquin had given more advice on avoiding exercises that conflict with one's individual anatomy. Many people are simply not constructed for doing parallel bar dips and parallel bar dips can stretch the shoulder capsule into what my kinesiology professor called \\""the red zone\\"" -- red meaning danger.<br />For precautions on arm exercises I like better DELAVIER'S ANATOMY FOR BIGGER, STRONGER ARMS by Frederic Delavier. The three books I have mentioned comprise a good library for anyone interested in weight training with the goal of getting bigger arms. Tesch's book would be the one I would consider a \\""must have\\"".<br />Oh, and me -- I'm a geezer for sure, but I have done one-arm chin-ups and six parallel bar dips with 140 LBS of added weight. I just have not done them lately is all."
883,5,"Dr. Sandy runs the pediatric practice that I take my children to and it is a well-respected and professional office. I purchased her book when my son was born and I was thrilled with the clear and detailed information that she provides to help first time parents who are muddling through the basics. I had so many well-intentioned family members and friends giving me advice that I often felt confused and overwhelmed, especially in those first few months. I hated to be \\""that mom\\"" who called the doctor everyday with basic questions and so it was wonderful to have this book as a quick reference guide when I wasn't sure about something. Knowing that Dr. Sandy is a medical professional and a leader in her field gave me confidence in the material but it was also easy to understand and geared towards the first time parent. My husband loved the book, too. We were both completely terrified of doing those first simple tasks the wrong way, such as bathing a newborn, and her clear illustrations really helped us get through everything. I loved this book and I hope she will continue to offer her expertise these subjects - maybe a toddler book in the future??"
884,1,"Warning: rape triggers mentioned.<br />The first issue of Nightbreed Jihad is okay but not great like the comics. The comic book series is really good, go read it. But book 2 of Nightbreed Jihad is just horrible. The story that's set up very quickly shows that Peloquin has a human girlfriend and anyone who's read the comics or has even really just thought a bit about the presentation of the character in the movie might guess that he doesn't really have the best of luck. So it's a good guess that she's going to die and she does. But first she gets raped by a Cenobite. Also she's pregnant and strapped to an OBGYN examination chair during said rape.<br /><br />This isn't just hinted at either. It's shown for three freaking pages. That's really upsetting and completely enough of a reason to avoid the Nightbreed Jihad duo. The story is weak, the art work is bleh and it's just very very upsetting."
885,5,"This small booklet is just about completely contained inside Sandor Katz's larger book on wild fermentation so you may not want both. But this one has the basics and is a very good place to start, and if you qualify for free shipping on your order, well worth it.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1931498237 Wild Fermentation: The Flavor, Nutrition, and Craft of Live-Culture Foods]]"
886,5,"Full disclosure: I've read all of Corbett's novels. He's one of my favorite crime writers. I've also taken a writing class with him, which isn't cheap. His help on my book was invaluable. Now for only $17 or less, you can get a valuable book on writing, like taking a master class. Thing is, it's not about \\""character,\\"" it's about how to create a living person in your work. A living person with drives, wants, and needs, values, an unconscious, with secrets and contradictions, and wounds. A person with heart rather than a \\""personality type.\\""  On and on the book goes from a simple premise, like a philosophical treatise, getting deeper and deeper into the self, the examined life, even marveling at the ultimate fiction of this self. A very rich and profound writing book. The many examples were very helpful. Finally, my epiphany: other characters define the main characters. \\""We don't know ourselves by ourselves,\\"" Corbett writes. For me, this book is a godsend. It helps lift me out of my overbearing subjectivity when I write, and helps me to really create fully realized characters in a \\""teeming\\"" world. My only negative is that he also used some examples from television, which I didn't know about--but after all, the book is for \\""fiction, film, and TV.\\"""

So Compendium #2, if my calculations are right, will get to season 6 if show runs that long.................But of course it'll run that long. Plus story, character narrative, illistrations are any TWD fans idea of a good time. Trust when I say this was worth every penny. Hurry please Compendium #3."
889,1,"I would love to red this book, but I am not going to pay more for a kindle edition of the book than I am for the paperback.<br /><br />Pricing for kindle books is out of control!"
890,5,"Book came quickly, but after a few weeks and some reading in it I notice there were some defective pages.  I submitted a replacement request and got the replacement book quickly.  I will be returning the defective one today.<br />I only kept the defective one until the replacement arrived because I was using it for school."
891,5,"I truly enjoyed the author's story. The Three simple steps are very simple. However, I can also see how my personal habits will have to be overcome. Protect your mentality, take quiet time and set intentions and eliminate doubt. I know that if I apply these simple steps diligently the quality of my life will improve. It is hard to disagree and argue with the author when he has a proven track record of success. I believe him."
892,5,"The old methods just wont cut it anymore. This book shows you how to get your message across in a world that rewards brief and to the point communication. The author certainly backs up his claims with solid research, and these are tested and true methods. If you are a spiritual leader and feel like you can do more to reach out to the widest audience, it might be time to brush up on these cutting edge methods. Get this book, highly recommended."

I have read MANY books, tapes and attended many seminars on self-improvement and this book is incredibly timely.<br />With the energetic shifts that r happening right now, this book hits the target!<br />He was way ahead of his time and yet preparing us for this auspicious time, it seems!<br />Thank you!"

897,5,I loved the honesty that was in this autobiography. I have been intrigued with adam ant for years and was excited to finally read about his life in his words. I could not put the book down. A great read. Loved it!!!
898,5,"One of the best books I've read in marketing/branding! It unravels such an undeniable, clear perspective on marketing that you wonder why you didn't see the connections before - it all seems so obvious after the fact. Using neuroscience and evolutionary psychology, the author ties the pillars of effective marketing to the ways we tick as social animals. Some of the best and most loved advertising campaigns are dissected, explained, backed up with science, and shown in a light that reveals new frameworks.<br /><br />- Are you in marketing? Read this book. It will teach you how to understand the consumer and create brands that can make lasting, emotional connections. (Read: It will make you money. Use this book to build a loyal, diehard fan base.)<br /><br />- Are you NOT in marketing? Even more of a reason to read this book. It will teach you how external factors influence your decision-making and how to be aware of unconscious blind spots. (Read: It will keep you from being parted from your money. Use this book to better understand your brain, be aware of how your unconscious may be making choices for you, and shield yourself from marketers who also read this book.)<br /><br />- Do you want to be a better communicator? Read this book. It will teach you how to present ideas in a powerfully effective way that speaks not only to people's rational minds, emotional feelings, and social inclinations, but also to their unconscious, evolutionary processes. (Read: It will make people want to listen to what you have to say.)<br /><br />- Do you want to make better decisions? Read this book. It will teach you how to understand why people are sometimes terribly irrational. (Read: Use this book to find lifehacks to not make your own irrational decisions. We all make them.)<br /><br />- Do you have kids? Read this book. It will teach you how to teach your kids to understand American materialism and their own desires of owning \\""things\\"". (Read: This book makes you a demi-god of a parent. People will be jealous of the wisdom and zen of your children. This one is a stretch.)<br /><br />- Do you NOT have kids? Read this book. It will teach you why you shouldn't have kids. (Just kidding.)<br /><br />In all seriousness, I think this book really humanizes marketing and branding - a refreshing take in a field that is increasingly obsessed with algorithms, data, and optimization. Personally, I found this book to be a new way to look at almost everything - its principles are applicable in all other areas of life. It's an overall great read. It's so good that I actually wrote a review about it. It's my first review on Amazon ever!"
899,5,"Quinn is a main character with a distinctive voice, and while the book pokes fun at pararom conventions (a monster-hunter gets bitten by a werewolf and a vampire on the same night!) it's as fun a read as any of the no-nutritional-value books it mocks. I love pararom as much as I love junk food of the non-literary variety, and reading Blood Oranges is like a game of spot-the-trope. This book should be a crowd-pleaser both for fans who love the genre and readers who would normally never touch a pararom book."
900,4,"Australian Young Adult Fiction is something new to me. This book was first published in 2010 under the title Good Oil. I must say that this book was a wonderful and quick read during my Christmas Holiday. It left me wanting to know more about sweet Amelia and her troubled Chris.<br /><br />The main setting is a supermarket. There are times when it's not, however 70% of the time, it is. So I quickly scanned my brain for childhood supermarkets and immediately thought of the small town Piggy Wiggly or SuperDuper grocery stores that were around and envisioned that during my reading. Amelia a young 15 year girl is a cashier and older Chris is her NEW Hire trainer. This brief moment in time and interaction forms a unique bond between Amelia and 21 year old Chris. Amelia forms an unspoken crush on her new coworker, but cherishes the friendship that they have developed and finds it very hard to act upon it. Chris admires Amelia. He admires her smartness and her different views on life as a teenager. He even protects her in a sense, until he can't any longer.<br /><br />Love and Other Perishable Items is told from two point of views. Through the eyes of Amelia and through the pages of Chris's journal. It is through the journal that the reader really learns a lot about Chris's life and his feelings for those closest to him. Ok, so I must say that I got a little teary eyed on this read , near the end. The author Laura Buzo, truly creates realistic characters with real world problems, with not so simplistic answers. But isn't that how life is sometimes. I originally thought that this book would get 3 trees. But then I was quickly reminded by book talk friend that just because a book goes in a direction that you do not want or wasn't expecting, doesn't mean it isn't great writing. She's right.<br /><br />Laura provides her readers with a novel that allows them to go down memory lane of teenage years (for those of us my age) and for the others it's just the perfect read that lets them know these crushes sometimes happen. In my eyes, Chris's journal represents a symbol of unspoken trust, feelings and respect. Giving this novel a try will not be a disappointment. It will be a road down pages and pages of love, heartache, and closure, though the eyes of a teenage girl. - Deitrethem know these crushes sometimes happen.

901,5,I have been looking for this book for a year. I had an old copy and wanted a new one.  It's a great study of the whole New Testament with a reading from the Bible and then a devotion to go with it...all in one book.  (Being combined is better than having to deal with a Bible and a book.)  One year and you have been through the New Testament.
902,5,"It's difficult for me to believe that this is a first effort from a new author. The characters are so well drawn, the plot so subtly complex that you don't realize it till the end, and the writing so vivid and satisfying. Erika Liodice manages in her debut what many authors never achieve: the ability to place you almost bodily into a setting you can feel, hear, taste, smell and see, with characters so real you'll swear you've actually met them. Better yet, her protagonist is a real human being, with character flaws large enough to make you not exactly love her all the time, but with whom you can't help identifying because she's...like you.<br /><br />I had some foreshadowing of the twist at the end, but not enough to have it really figured out in a way that made it less enjoyable. In fact, just the opposite: I had figured out enough to know there was going to be a real eye-opener, and savored the slow build to that final climax. Wow. That kind of pacing, with just the right amount of revelation to keep you turning the page, is another skill that many writers pray for and never achieve.<br /><br />This is just really good writing. I have to admit that it's not a story I'd originally have picked up on my own, but it was recommended to me by someone I trust, so I gave it a shot. I'm so glad I did. I'd really have missed something if I didn't read this book. The characters stayed with me long after I'd finished that last page."
903,4,"Using an experimental storytelling technique that requires some dedication from the reader, E.L. Doctorow told the story of the Master of Loon Lake, a man who takes an unlikely route to reach his station in life.<br /><br />According to the book jacket, the hero of the Depression-era story is Joe from Paterson, a drifter and former hand at a carnival who ends up at Loon Lake, a retreat in the Adirondacks, by accident - retracing a similar path taken by the poet of Loon Lake.  Both drifter and poet wind up at the estate of FW Bennett, a robber baron barely distinguishable among the likes of Rockefeller and Carnegie and Henry Ford.  The odd and eerie interactions and coincidences cause the characters to understand themselves better, and to revisit brief connections made in earlier stations in life.<br /><br />While Joe from Patterson is the main character of the novel, Warren Penfield -the aforementioned poet of dubious abilities - is not too far behind.  Another important character is Clara Lukacs, the daughter of an owner of a funeral parlor who becomes the mistress of a gangster, then the mistress of the industrial scion.  Clara also has a connection with Penfield, and develops one with Joe during the story.<br /><br />The robber baron, F.W. Bennett, plays a big role in the plot, while only making a small appearance in the novel.  Other characters with small but important roles are the aviatrix Lucille Bennett, who is married to FW Bennett, the industrial agent / gangster Thomas Crapo, and an employee of Bennett Autobody Number 6 in Jacksontown, Indiana named Red James.  His young wife Sally is transparent, but Red James is one of several surprises of the novel.<br /><br />Warren Penfield first arrived at Loon Lake with the intention of killing F.W. Bennett - but his rather poor impersonation of Alexander Berkman began an eight-year detour at Loon Lake.  Before his life at Loon Lake, Penfield did have some interaction with a pair of worker's movements that are lionized by leftists liberals socialists commies and all others with shades of pink and red in between.<br /><br />Penfield grew up in Ludlow, Colorado - where the Colorado Coal Mines Strike endured from September 1913 to December 1914.  It was organized by the United Mine Workers against the Colorado coal companies, the largest of which was the Colorado Fuel & Iron Company, owned by John D. Rockefeller.  There was a tent colony of 1200 strikers in Ludlow, which was attacked by the camp guards from CF&I and the Colorado National Guard on April 20, 1914.  The Ludlow Massacre claimed the lives of two women and a dozen children who were suffocated in a fire initiated by the attackers.  Infuriated miners responded to the attack with raids on mines for the next ten days.<br /><br />The second worker's movement was the Seattle General Strike of 1919.  After the conclusion of World War I, unions in the shipbuilding industry of Seattle demanded a pay increase.  The reasons behind the wage freezes of the last two years, installed as part of the war effort, were no longer valid.  Most other local unions joined the general strike when it appeared as though the federal government was siding with employer interests in early talks.  A General Strike Committee acted as a counter-government for the city during the strike, discharging members who performed essential city services from the strike. A worker could indeed get a meal for 25 cents during the strike, just like the one described by a young Warren Penfield.  The strike ended after little more than a week as leaders of international unions began to pressure their Seattle affiliates to end their role in the general strike.  Increased police and military personnel called by Mayor Ole Hanson also seemed like a threat that the union was not prepared to defy.  Some of the IWW leaders involved in the strike were considered subversives and later arrested.<br /><br />The narration of the novel jumps from one character to another - primarily between Penfield and Paterson.  Different readers have their own techniques to gain focus on the story. My solution was to read some chapters out loud, similar to the way an author would at a promotional book reading. The extra effort to read the novel was worth the investment of time."
904,3,"This is a difficult book to review that has been written, without a doubt, with good intent about a very serious subject. Cancer.<br />According to the publisher, this book is for the woman `...who has been handed the cancer card-and for the one who never wants to get it.' Written by two Cancer survivors, the authors set out to share `girlfriend-style' knowledge and experiences about the healing power of food, stories of cancer ups and downs with more than 100 recipes for fighting cancer and soothing symptoms of treatment.<br />This reviewer, a male who has no direct experience of cancer, desperately is trying to remain sympathetic about this book. It is clear that unless you have or have had cancer you cannot really, truly, appreciate how deliberating the disease is and its effects on everyday life. Yet, this reviewer is not exactly sold on the idea that this book is the way forward. It could be a matter of style. In a bid to be informal and friendly maybe it tries just too much. Maybe the book tries to pigeon-hole itself too hard.<br />To be clear, no opinion is given as to the efficacy of the dietary regime under discussion - this is something that should be discussed with a healthcare professional. It is clear that many of the suggestions can have general health benefits and if these benefits help you `handle' your cancer better (if one can even say such a thing without appearing obtuse) then is that a bad thing. Yet equally can the `benefits' be really demonstrated as being efficacious compared to any other dietary regime? The dietary regime being proposed by the authors is not so easily categorised. The authors admit that they have a focus on real, plant-based foods that retains flexibility, based on individual choice, for some animal proteins.<br />Once you start to dig through the book, you note that there are two main sections, a `girlfriend's guide' and then the recipes. The former details the authors' personal cancer stories, details of support and resource connections as well as more detailed information about the range and scope of the dietary regime. The latter section, the recipes, should be self-explanatory. The book is clearly written from a North American-perspective and thus there will probably be some subtle differences with healthcare pathways and procedures in your own country (if you are not based in the U.S.). However this should not be a significant barrier to hinderance.<br />The feeling behind the authors' text is not in question and certainly there is a lot of information that would appeal to the health-conscious person, whether they have cancer or not. This reviewer just feels that the initial `packaging' and tone the book sets up too many hackles and might encourage the casual browser to pass on by. With books of this nature, it is more likely that you will form a close personal connection to the book and what it stands for OR you will form a strong indifference and possibily hostility. There is not so much middle ground and thus a closer, personal inspection of this book prior to possible purchase would be strongly recommended. Don't just buy it blind.<br />Looking at the recipes themselves, some of them look sufficiently different to even appeal to a hardened meat-eater, such as an `Oatmeal Carrot Cookie Smoothie' or `Sweet & Strong Adzuki Beans.\\"" Each recipe starts with a short bullet point about its raison d'être, such as `blood boosting, constipation kicking' and a short introduction. The ingredients' list and procedure are concisely written so there is no major hassle involved in making the dishes. There is a collection of photographs bound together rather than appearing next to each dish - and that is mostly an irritant when you are browsing through the book for inspiration. Are you likely to be using this book though as a casual browsing source? Debatable.<br />So all in all this book is a much of a muchness. A strong recommendation for or against cannot be made. If you are a cancer sufferer and you are looking at changing your diet it might be worthy of a read or consideration. If you are looking for a general health-changing book this might not directly hit the target, but if you can check it out in a bookstore it might be worthy of a glance at least. A difficult conclusion, over a book that purportedly can help mitigate and help those suffering from a very difficult, consuming illness.rer and you are looking at changing your diet it might be worthy of a read or consideration.

910,5,Meredith is funny and the book is a quick read. Great advice for triathletes. I hope this book inspires more people to take on this great sport that is great for the soul and the body.
911,5,"THIS IS THE BEST ONE IN THE SERIES SO FAR. I DID NOT THINK THE LAST BOOK COULD BE BEATEN, BUT THIS ONE HAS LEFT IT IN THE DUST.WENDY HAS EVERYONE IN THIS ONE THRU OUT THE BOOK, FROM GOD TO CHRIST. WHEN CHRIST TALKS TO THE CHARACTERS IN THIS BOOK, SHE MAKES IT FEEL LIKE YOU ARE IN A REAL CONVERSATION IS GOING ON RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU. WHEN THE RATURE HAPPENS YOU HAVE TO CHEER FOR THE LUCKY PPL WHO ARE BEING TAKEN TO HEAVEN. I CAN NOT WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOOK IN THIS SERIES JUST TO SEE SATAN GET HIS BUT KICK."
912,5,"When I started reading this book I knew within the first few pages that I would not be able to put it down until I finished it. This book not only give you a glimps into the life of Pastor Benny and his family, but it builds up your hope and faith for whatever you may be going through. And how God can use the storm we go through to bring us closer to Him, to bring revelation that He is always in control. This is a book everyone, Christians and non-Christians alike need to read."
913,5,"If you like Tom Clancy, then you'll like this book.  It benefits from the time spent in Scandinavia by the author working defense projects on the behalf of a prominent American defense contractor. The novel echoes  many of the reports of Soviet submarine intrusions into Sweden's territorial waters during the cold war, despite Sweden's neutrality.  It's a fun read!"
914,5,"I have been following the Ingram's story at [...], so I knew the basic premise of Following After Trek before I read the book--true story chapters that recount their real life events, followed by chapters inspired by a dream that Jarrett had after Trek passed away.  I was looking forward to the book, but I was a little wary of the dream chapters because I'm not big into science fiction--I mostly just wanted to read about their real-life experience with Trek from Jarrett's perspective.  That being said, I could not put this book down, and found that the dream chapters were the ones I began to look forward to as I got further and further into the book.  It really is a brilliant construct--as the real-life chapters get more difficult and sad to read, the dream chapters become more hopeful and uplifting.  By the end of the book, I was so engrossed in Jarrett's dream world that it truly felt like real life.  I think the answer Jarrett provides to the question about what happens when a loved one dies questions is the most profound and moving answer--his dream world is what I hope happens when I die, because it is beautiful and so much more than a heaven made of clouds and angels.  The book has stayed with me long after I finished reading, and I highly recommend Following After Trek--it's an amazing story!"
915,4,Very interesting. Every teacher needs to read this book to better understand how to determine students that could have problems.
916,5,"Everyone should read this.  Gives you the insight as to how you should not only live your life, but lead others also."
917,5,"Each chapter is less than a 5 minute read and gives you plenty to think about.  Challenged me on how I went about my day and thought about different obligations, projects, and responsibilities."
918,5,"Shuronda writes from a personal perspective that is relatable and encouraging.  Through her writing, you are encouraged to dream again of the many possibilities that you may have thought were not possible.  Her writing is engaging and thought provoking. In highly recommend this book!"
919,5,"I am an artist and writer and this encyclopedia is chock full of information from a lot of sources, so there is plenty of research material to get you started."
920,5,Betty Cotton has written an excellent book showing her method of &#34;quilt as you go&#34;.  Great photos and easy to understand explanations of the method.
921,5,"Peter Hessler is a fine writer, with insight and sensitivity. He gets the balance between personal anecdote and travel writing just right. I am learning so much about Chinese society and customs."
922,5,"This is a fantastic supplemental resource for behavior management. It is not a plug and play fix for behavior issues, but it provides a solid blueprint, with varying plans for each issue, for educators to shape to the individual student's needs. it is not going to do the work for the teacher, and results will vary and adaptations will have to be made. Just like any behavior plan in the real world. This is a great brainstorming tool for experienced teachers, as well as a must have for beginners."
923,4,well i do not like it all wrinkeld and it is kind of durty it was worth it wish it was more clean
924,5,It's book is truly different than most of the books out! It's really wonderful. The first 20 pages seem to drag on a little but pay attention! This is one of those books where every detail matters in the end. It will keep you guessing the whole time! Highly recommend :)
925,5,"Many Iranians take pride in the pre-islamic history of Iran, especially the accomplishments of Cyrus the Great. This book is an excellend book to read if you want to understand the character of Cyrus the Great . It is a one-of-a-kind book. I really liked the book and bought several other copies as birthday presents (especially for children of Iranian heritage). It is a very positive book and truely an excellent book on leadership."
926,5,Daughter and son in law loved the book!! They love adventure and travel.  Will be a helpful resource for them they said.
927,4,"A \\""used\\"" 727 goes mysteriously missing in Angola, and the alphabet soup of agencies say its no problem, can't make it to the US and has probably been destroyed for insurance. Because of agency infighting, the president assigns Major Charley Castillo to find out who's telling him the truth and who's pointing fingers and covering their butt.  To do this, Castillo has to find out about the hijacking of the plane and who knew what.  As a consequence of his work in Angola, he meets up with a shady Russian arms dealer who has an interest in helping him find the plane.  He then begins to track the known locations of the plane and uncovers a terrorist plot to use the plane as a guided bomb in the US.<br /><br />I make the reference to James Bond because of the number of location switches and the Major's success rate with the opposite sex.  In general, this is an entertaining book.  Don't look for deep meaning or philosophical debate.  At best, Griffin does a good job of pointing out the failure of the US government to operate efficiently.  In many ways this is like a more well developed Patrick Robinson novel.  There appear to be seven novels in this series, of which this is the first (and my first Griffin novel).  It also appears that Griffin is well published in this area and has more than 30 books on the market.  This is definitely an author that knows his material and readers and knows how to spin a story. Griffin handles technology well, and I didn't catch any slop due to not understanding the science.  His plot is not so canned as to put you to sleep, although I wouldn't call it incredibly creative.  It does have enough variation to keep you following and interested.  Griffin is obviously a veteran author and handles pacing and content like a pro.  There are no real lags in this story and and no superfluous parts that needed to be extracted from the story or tied up.<br /><br />Summary:  If you like the terrorist, special forces, James Bond-like story, this is a good choice.choice."
928,5,"This book teaches you a variety of activities such as clothespin and baskets to stimulate brain and sensory development .In this book are ways for you to help children on,ways to encourage brushing teeth, Brushing hair,cleaning up by setting an area just for children"

930,1,"This is the most illiterate collection of random words I have ever seen and unfortunately I paid for it. Don't bother, this book has little at all to do with camping"
931,1,"If it would let me, I would give negative stars! This is the worst company Ive ever dealt with.  I order and paid for expedited shipping. I even emailed to express I was in a crunch and asked if they were shipping asap. No answer, I gave it two days and emailed them again, no answer. Gave it one more day, canceled my order, called Amazon, emailed them again, as did Amazon... still No answer?!?! They haven't charged me as of yet, but I have been going in and emailing them everyday and requesting to cancel my order. We'll see if they ever try to contact me! I would never go through them or recommend again. In fact I think I will post everywhere I can to warn others DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!!!!"
932,5,"\\""Inhuman Bondage\\"" is an engaging, well-written, and fascinating history of slavery in the Western Hemisphere.<br /><br />I have an interest in the Civil War, and picked out this book to provide some background to understanding the roots of slavery in the United States.  I couldn't have picked out a better book!<br /><br />Mr. Davis provides thorough coverage of every aspect of New World slavery, from its old world origins, to the history of abolitionism in England and America, to the end of American slavery with the Civil War.  Davis has his own biases, but he doesn't hide them, and succeeds in presenting opposing viewpoints.<br /><br />While slavery was clearly a central theme towards the end of the war, there is less agreement about how important it was as its cause (vs. 'maintaining the Union').  Davis provides a convincing argument that slavery was, in fact, central to the very genesis of this conflict, with a degree of inevitability going all the way back to the founding of this country.<br /><br />For any armchair Civil War historian, this is an essential (and enjoyable!) read.  It is fascinating, engaging, and highly educational.  Highly recommended!"
933,4,"I'm not American, an historian or a meteorologist, so had never heard of the Galveston storm, but I was very quickly enthralled by this tale. Initially, I found the writing a bit over-blown for my taste, but I soon got into the swing of the story. If I'd have just read an online sample, I probably wouldn't have bought the book, which would have been a pity. The author has done a great job of bringing this disaster to life by telling the story of the storm through the words of those who were there. It's fascinating to see how sometimes little has changed - there are some cracking examples of people making decisions in their own interest, or for political gain, rather than for the common good - and also how much has changed - imagine if weather data was sent in by telegram today! If you read this book, then consider the impact of the recent big storms to hit the States, you will get a real sense of how far mankind has come in protecting citizens from weather extremes. I would have loved to have seen some photos included with this book, though. Otherwise, I'd definitely recommend it."
934,5,"Well written with practical ideas that have been proven on the street. Makes you rethink many assumptions you may have had about your weapons, gear and tactics."
935,5,"As a first time role-player, this has been very helpful. And the friends I play with think it's awesome that it was a re print from this year. They find it as awesome as I do."
936,5,"I loved her humor and romance book Confessions of an Alli Cat and thought I would try another book she wrote. This read was nothing that I expected in a very good way as a totally different genre. I was expecting a story line about a spoiled pampered daughter and her wealthy political driven family,who lived in IL.I got that and so much more ,as Ms. Cole can really weave a plot. I got so many different twists of characters,a little romance, mystery,drama, and so much tension that I had to read in one sitting.I'm in awe of Ms. Cole as a writer!"
937,5,"Exellent read. If a book doesn't have my attention in the first few pages, I probably won't finish it.<br />It was very well written, I loved the dialogue between his characters. I'm looking forward to his next<br />book."
938,5,"I had to check out what the fuss was all about. At first it was hard to get into it, but quickly you get addicted and before you know it, you have read the third book! I loved it!"
939,3,"When I received this book, it took much time to review in light of  circumstances affecting children in our country in the past month. I am not clear how an author could conceive such description of pure evil. This book consists of several story lines. Some might find this book engaging. I find it violent. The story line is engaging, but the beginning of the book jumps around too much and works more like a puzzle to be fit together than a clear concise story line.<br /><br />Fire of the Raging Dragon explores the changing relationship between China and the USA and how consequences of choices may one day play out on a political level. Fire of The Raging Dragon also devels into moral and ethical issues China faces and the accountability of the US government. Be warned as a reader, there are descriptions in the book that are upsetting especially if the reader has little girls. The book contains gruesome unsettling crimes against humanity (p.139-154).<br /><br />Fire of the Raging Dragon is the story of attack. China,  US, and Taiwan.  Also, the president's daughter involvement increases the drama. This book contained similar elements form Jenkins, Accused.<br /><br />I received this book free from Zondervan publishing."
940,4,"I have to admit, I'm not the biggest fan of Nabokov. Too often, I feel the sense that he's showing off his skill and just not getting to the point. Maybe I'm not the kind of reader he intended to write for, but I just don't enjoy the way he spins the stories in his novels, with the exception of Lolita. Surprisingly though, I find that his writing works well in short stories, or in this case, novellas. Quite frankly, I enjoyed the fact that the focus wasn't so much on the plot, but on the changes that the character undergoes psychologically. We take the initial premise of revisiting first love, and we see it being used as a cause for change. I'm not going to go into too much detail on major themes of the book, but I do want to put focus on one way of reading what Mary means to Ganin; yes, what spurs on the connection between the two is that of young, first love, but ultimately, it is memory, not love, that drives the man."
941,5,"Please refer to my review of Book Four in this wonderful series. They are not to be missed by the human who wants to reflect on life, not just run through it. These words make Life more beautiful."
942,5,I gave this poem to my mother for her birthday and it made her cry she loved it so much.
943,5,This book revealed many details about the history of a form of music whose popularity was short lived (1930's to late 1940's) but may have planted the seeds for many Rock and blues musicians to cultivate. I thoroughly enjoyed the reading.
944,5,"I spent half an hour skimming through this book before wrapping it up as a Christmas gift.  It was fun to read about how everyday items got their start - who did it, when, where, why.  It's a book that you could read cover to cover or just pick up now and then and read a few pages.  Good gift!"
945,5,"It was in new condition. Came right on time. It ended up not being used as much as I thought throughout the course, but that's on a different note. Thanks."
946,5,"Christmas gift for 9yr old Indiana Jones fan.  Cute book, explains how to handle yourself in various situations (just like Indiana Jones would).  Very different from other books; great to add to your collection. Definetly would recommed this book!!"
947,2,"I was pretty excited to receive this book, as I myself rail against the anti-scientific left and the politicization of science. Ironically, the book is more political than scientific.<br /><br />First, the good points that they touch on:<br /><br />- The widespread adherence to the naturalistic fallacy on the left is terribly anti-scientific and damaging.<br /><br />- Yucca mountain should never have been shut down, and nuclear energy should be more vigorously pursued. (they actually don't spend nearly enough time on this topic)<br /><br />- Organic food is, by and large, a scam.<br /><br />- Fuel ethanol is worse than useless.<br /><br />- GMOs are probably key to feeding our growing population, and people opposed to them due to health concerns are ignorant. (points for mentioning the superiority of Bt corn, minus several points for using the typical weak \\""Golden Rice\\"" example)<br /><br />- Anti-vaccine activists are evil and stupid.<br /><br />- Progressives are inconsistent about their support of clean energy versus other environmental concerns.<br /><br />But those are the high points in a sea of sludgy rhetoric - the book's tone veers erratically from reasoned arguments to straight up childish mocking of straw men, digging up the wackiest left-wing beliefs they can find and tarring all \\""progressives\\"" with that brush. They repeatedly drag out tired conservative tropes like \\""banning happy meals and plastic bags\\"". They outright say things like \\""animal rights activists are crazy\\"", and that feminists, by saying that most psychological gender differences are not innate, are basically equivalent to creationists. Any pretense of impartiality is completely obliterated by the time you make it halfway through. Don't get me wrong, I love me some mocking of hippies, but it's really overdone for a book with aspirations of being apolitical.<br /><br />They present claims that they must know are false, but can't resist bringing up anyway, like \\""being vegetarian will result inmore environmental damage and animal cruelty than eating meat\\"". This wild conjecture is based upon the same kinds of dubious calculations they go on to ridicule when it comes to calculating emissions needed for different types of food production (they use the same specious math in the section on electric vehicles). They cite one study only relevant to Australia's cattle ranching, and even cite Steven Davis' famous but discredited paper, which is a sure sign of sloppy research pursuant to an agenda.<br /><br />Where they really go off the rails, though, is in chapter 10, where they actually start referencing \\""evolutionary psychology\\"" as evidence for innate gender differences. Guys - evolutionary psychology is not science. And I say this as a longtime student of it, owning most of David Buss' works. It's ultimately white males with no grounding in evolutionary theory spouting contrived speculation, usually to justify sexual inequality or attributes associated to gender. I recommend the book [[ASIN:0262514214 Evolutionary Psychology as Maladapted Psychology]], which addresses this topic in detail.<br /><br />Like \\""evolutionary psychologists\\"", the authors have an embarrassingly bad grasp of study design, and keep saying things essentially like \\""men were shown to behave in x fashion, while women were shown to behave in y fashion. Therefore, it's genetic!\\"" Most of their gender arguments are puerile and largely demolished by books like [[ASIN:1590510348 Gene Worship]] and [[ASIN:0393340244 Delusions of Gender]].<br /><br />But the pièce de résistance: they actually defend Lazar Greenfield. And at that point, it was clear that they were clueless, Steven Pinker-loving white guys. Lazar Greenfield was forced to step down as the editor of Surgery News after writing an allegedly humorous editorial, based upon a shoddy study which concluded that ingesting sperm via unprotected sex had anti-depressant properties for women. He suggested in the journal that maybe men should givewomen the gift of semen for Valentine's Day instead of chocolate - that is, women should be good sperm receptacles for their own well-being. It should be pretty clear that given the disenfranchisement of women in scientific fields, an authority figure shouldn't be making such obnoxious and demeaning comments - but the authors refer to his subsequent removal as him being a victim of \\""the progressive censorship machine\\"".<br /><br />From there on out, it's a rambling mess of Republican talking points that are only loosely related to science, like affirmative action (gauchely referring to it as \\""reverse racism\\"") and drilling in ANWR - while they could have been addressing actually interesting things, like hippie objections to High Fructose Corn Syrup - until chapter 15, where they have an uncharacteristically sensible set of scientific and social goals for the years ahead. But by then, many will have set the book down, and will have missed little."
948,5,"At 202 pages, I thought this would be an easy read with hopefully some practical advice for financial management. It was more than I expected. I found myself captivated by the author's interweaving of the classic Art of War by Sun Tzu with his strategies for making money, so much so that as I read it the first time, I constantly dog-eared pages, went back to re-read parts of it, then found myself going through it all again, this time with a highlighter, making notes in the text and a list of ideas to employ as I try to put into practice some of the sound advice found throughout this book. Highly-recommended reading for anyone interested in serious strategies for improving their financial position. I don't give out 5-star reviews, they have to be earned and this one earned it. As the new year starts, I have a list of strategies I'll be employing to put Sun Tzu: The Art of Making Money to the test. Buy this book, get out your highlighter and get ready to take notes."

I know a book is a winner when the time is up and the bike starts to spin and I don't want to stop. The author knows how to spin a story. As a reader  you find yourself caring deeply about the characters in the book. The is a great balance of plot, description, and character development that engages the reader throughout. It is a fast satisfying read."

Well thought-out, great photography- the kind of book I love to pick up to find a recipe for some ingredient I just returned from the market with, then find myself immersed in fascinating anecdotes or descriptions of home kitchens or markets of Morocco. (And mouth-watering recipes.) Mourad Lahlou writes in a wonderful conversational style that just makes you want to read on and on.  Highly recommended!"

960,3,"Grubacic sums up what US/EU imperialism has achieved in the Balkans: \\""Torture in the name of democracy. Occupation in the name of freedom. Bombing in the name of humanitarian intervention. Protectorates in the name of state-building. Wars of terror in the name of a war on terror.\\""<br /><br />The USA has always wanted to get a US military foothold in the Balkans. Now it has the huge new military base of Camp Bondsteel, Europe's Guantanamo.<br /><br />NATO bombs in 1999 of Yugoslavia caused $50 billions' worth of damage. The bombing was illegal, but set a precedent for `humanitarian' intervention without a UN mandate.<br /><br />The UN Charter does not allow the Security Council to set up any international body. Yet the Security Council set up the Hague Tribunal, citing Article 29 of the UN Charter as its warrant. But Article 29 only allows it to set up a `subsidiary body'. An international court must be an independent, not a subsidiary, body. So the Tribunal is illegitimate.<br /><br />The USA forced Serbia to extradite its president Milosevic to the Tribunal. But under the 1975 European Convention on Extradition, states have the right to refuse extradition of their own citizens, even those accused of severe breaches of the laws of war (Article 6, paragraph 1a).<br /><br /> Germany's recognition of Croatia in 1991 started the disintegration of Yugoslavia into six fragments. The EU opposes united nations as a threat to its powers. Western media and the ultra-left echo the EU - that nations and nationalists are the enemy. Anarchists like Grubacic and Noam Chomsky aid the US/EU destruction of nation-states. Grubacic calls for `a balkanised Europe of regions', an exact echo of the EU. He urges the partition of Kosovo (pages 197-8), as does Chomsky (pages 203-4).<br /><br />The six fragments are in chaos. Unemployment in Bosnia is 40 per cent plus, in Kosovo 40 per cent and in Serbia 30 per cent. In 2001 Serbia's crash programme of privatising all socially owned property virtually deindustrialised it. One million workers lost their jobs, 70 per cent of the population are in poverty.<br /><br />Kosovo's Prime Minister Hashim Thaçi is a war criminal, with links to the criminal underworld (so say secret NATO reports), head of a human organ and arms ring, and he was a leader of the terror group the KLA.

966,5,"Happy Herbivore Abroad is a kitchen essential!  With pictures and easy to create recipes from around the world, there is something for everyone in this book.  In addition, Lindsay Nixon includes anecdotal stories about how the recipes were developed, which makes them that more interesting.  One of my favorite things about the book is that most of the recipes are made from kitchen staples and do not involve hours slaving over a hot stove.  Simple and easy, topped off with healthy, makes this an ideal resource!"
967,5,"Ir&egrave;ne N&eacute;mirovsky was a talented writer with an amazing outlook that makes her wonderful book, \\""Suite Française,\\"" a captivating read.  Although it's a complicated account of the arduous circumstances endured by the French people when the Germans occupied France early in 1940, the author kept it well-organized and easy to follow.<br /><br />N&eacute;mirovsky was a writer with Jewish forebearers living in Paris during the occupation and witnessed the events she wrote about.  After writing this book, although having converted to Catholicism, she was arrested in July, 1942 and sent to Auschwitz where she died.  Her husband, Michel Epstein, was arrested three months later, and was sent to the gas chamber at Auschwitz never knowing the whereabouts of his beloved wife.<br /><br />Nemirovsky must have written the book during the occupation and hidden it away because it didn't surface until sixty-four years later.  The deprivations she surely endured while imprisoned were after the writing of this book and thus were not reflected within its pages.  Instead we read about the fear, discomfort, and unpleasant upheaval suffered by most citizens during the occupation in clear and focused language that is strangely poetic and tranquil.  Consequently, as a reader, I was able to feel the resolve and the courage of the French people as described by a writer with the ability to illustrate in a pastel style rather than garish prose.  I was able to savor her stories rather than be bludgeoned with them.<br /><br />The stories were carefully rendered to present the many different mechanisms for coping.  A man known for his frugality met an unusual end that denied him the enjoyment he longed for.  A young couple who catered to an oppressive employer got retribution in an odd way.  A young woman whose unfaithful husband is a held prisoner by enemy forces finds growing attraction for a young German officer who has commandeered a room in her farmhouse.  An aristocratic woman scoffs at the locals for failing to appreciate her ability to get what she wants from the oppressors.  A husband returns from the front and finds a German officer billeted in his home with obvious intentions towards the wife he left behind.  I'll leave the conclusions to these circumstances for the reader to uncover.<br /><br />There is no single theme to the book other than presenting the many ways the conquered French were impacted by the occupation, and the various ways they chose to cope with it.  There are both comical and tender moments.  There is prosperity to be found amidst paucity.  There is infidelity that is tempered by incredible loyalty.  Every act of inhumanity is tempered through bravery and strength.<br /><br />Ordinarily I'm not fond of translated works but Sandra Smith deserves special praise for her efforts with this novel.  It was obscure and a work-in-progress so Smith, as she explains in her book notation, had to correct some minor errors and clarify some confusion.  Her respect and admiration for the author allowed her to take some \\""leaps of faith\\"" and liberties with the story without essentially altering the tone and intention of N&eacute;mirovsky's writing.<br /><br />There are also marvelous appendixes with a transcription of N&eacute;mirovsky's handwritten notes, correspondences from 1936-1945, including information about the author's imprisonment and death, and the preface to the French edition published in 2004; great reading that provides valuable background information.  The correspondences are poignant and painful to read considering the barbaric end to the lives of both Nemirovsky and her husband.<br /><br />I enthusiastically recommend this book as a motivating read absent the coarseness of so many current novels.  If you love language and a writer who uses it beautifully, don't miss \\""Suite Française.\\""<br /><br />Schuyler T Wallace<br />Author of TIN LIZARD TALES"

The notes are stated as fact, when many could be considered interpretation.<br />  I'm not sure how to make that happen throughout without becoming redundant, but I noticed.<br />3.

Hope, more comfortable hiding behind her camera then dealing with emotions, arrives a week before Christmas to take photographs. Watching the perfectionist heroine let down her guard and fall in love with someone who, though not perfect on the outside, is perfect for her on the inside is a story worth reading - especially on one of those cold, snowy nights leading up to Christmas. If you haven't read this author before, this is a great place to start. And if you have, you'll know the treat waiting for you."

And, sure enough, I found what I was looking for.  Unfortunately, my guess was correct regarding the invasiveness with \\""one of the world's worse weeds\\"", paragrass.<br /><br />With this guide's help I also determined we have about fourteen other types of grasses within our lawn, some good and some bad.  Short of using the Florida's plant atlas website, this is a wonderful reference book if you want to determine many of those 'weeds' that have taken over your yard.<br /><br />The book contains some nice colorful pictures showing not only the form of each of the grasses but also what they look like when they go to seed.  This is important to know because, honestly, many of the grasses look similar in growth habit.  Published by the University Press of Florida, this is a wonderful supplement to keep on your Florida gardening bookshelf."

I would caution anyone from purchasing or following his protocols until questions surrounding his death are answered honestly!<br /><br />I am a member of the Andreas Moritz Facebook page and was BLOCKED for asking what he died from.  As a customer, I feel I have the right to know if his passing was directly related to the health protocols recommended in his books.<br /><br />Did he die from Cancer?, did he die from doing his liver cleanse? HIV?  How did Andreas Moritz die?  I will continue to ask this question until it is answered.  We deserve answers."
980,3,"I had an especially difficult time writing this review, though I couldn't have told you exactly why. What I've since discovered is that while writing this review, I kept feeling is as if I were justifying my love for Nora Roberts, instead of describing it and why. I've seen so many knock her books, deeming it something you'd pick up from your grandmother's library shelf. And that riles me up. As cheesesauce as this may sound, to a lonely fifteen-year-old holed up in her room, Nora Roberts was the authority on all things romantic and love related. Because three years ago, I'd understood that Roberts often didn't exaggerate the romance. She shows us practical romance, in which every day people--with some beautiful and some average-looking main characters--fall in love over every day things, in which the women find their own and take their men as they are instead of changing them or wishing for something different. It's realistic.<br /><br />Roberts makes simple, practical romance sexy and desirable, and somehow magical. Whenever I read one of her books, it makes boundless, deep love not only believable but possible. And to have anyone say different makes me cranky. Because they're comfortable, meaningful, and realistic. It's the same for The Perfect Hope by Nora Roberts. Roberts is the one who instigated my unabashed love for books featuring a brood of brothers. Now, I won't argue that Roberts has certainly picked up a pattern and sticks to her character formulas. Anyone who's read her books knows that in just about any trilogy of brothers or brotherlike friends, Roberts introduces the level-headed one, the nice, perhaps anal one, and the rough-around-the-edges, abrupt one. It's a tried and true favorite that can get somewhat obvious, predictable, and even a teeny bit boring. However, because Roberts makes each version a little different, they're never all the same, and therefore it's easy to look past what might annoy some. Keep in mind, though, that this is only really obvious if you've been a long-time reader of the author. Otherwise, I don't think it would be as irritatingly noticeable.<br /><br />That said, I don't love the Inn Boonsboro Trilogy. It's not a new favorite like The Witness. However, I'm nowhere near knocking it. I enjoyed each of the books immensely on principle--they're written by one of my favorite authors. Plus, they're modern, funny, and just lovely. I'd been anticipating The Perfect Hope by Nora Roberts in particular because, true to nature, I always get slightly more excited for the next installment when we're talking about the tough brother. The sparks have been flying between he and Hope for some time. And, in some ways, this book did disappoint. I wasn't a big fan of the lack of spotlight on the romance. I felt as if Roberts chose to focus more on the actual building and handywork than the relationship blooming between Ryder and Hope. Also, I missed the sex Roberts used to write so well. I find that in recent book series in particular they're cut short and aren't lingered on as much as I'd have liked. The negatives aside, there is plenty left to like in this installment in particular. One thing Roberts always does really well is bringing things full circle. We may not get every single perspective of characters past, but it's nice to see the past two couples in a good, solid place while a new one is muddling their way and trying to find a rhythm.<br /><br />The humor is there, the loving female relationships are there, and the romance is dazzling for any wistful, starry-eyed romantic. Ryder and Hope's relationship flows very well and the bond formed as a couple is something true to who they are as individuals. They are both flawed and complete opposites, yet on the most basic and fundamental principles and traits they agree and unite. It's a heart-warming compatibility that I really wish had more page time. While I enjoyed the side mystery of the resident ghost in Inn Boonsboro, it certainly wasn't mymain concern, and the same can be said of the detail with regards to all the Building Stuff happening. Still, that full circle bit really dissolved my disappointment so that I was left with nothing but warmth and joy by the end.<br /><br />Most Likely to Be Enjoyed By: If you're a Roberts fan then the formulaic characters may set you back some, but once you take note of their differences from characters past, it's easy to love the Montgomery brothers. These books don't seem like they'd have much going on in them, but just as daily living can get complex so can the plot. It chronicles the building projects begun throughout the series, the romances between each of the brothers and their women, the progress of uncovering the mystery of Lizzy the ghost, and any other smaller-scale dilemmas that crop up as a result of pasts coming around to cause a rift. I always stick to Roberts' books for the characters and their romances, and I think the Inn Boonsboro Trilogy overall has enough good quality of both for it to be an engaging, enjoyable series.<br /><br />Content Warning: This is an adult book. That means heavy kissing, sex, and profanity aren't implied and flowery. However, Roberts is never especially explicit either. There is some blood and violence throughout the series, but nothing too exciting.main concern, and the same can be said of the detail with regards to all the Building Stuff happening.

982,2,"I expected \\""Must Have Been Something I Ate\\"" to be a cookbook. There are only 25 recipes. The remainder of the book is information that is easily accessible on the internet.

983,5,"SHEPHERD GIRL is a delight, and beautifully written.  It's a good \\""dog book\\"" for the general dog lover, but stands out with how the author captures the uniqueness of the German Shepherd Dog (GSD) personality, eagerness to work and be a helper to its master, beauty and dignity, and - of course - goofiness (there's no other word for this characteristic).  After my wife and I both read it, we ordered four more copies for friends for whom the GSD has a special place in their hearts."
984,5,"Defend the Realm is of course an \\""authorized history.\\""  It's hard to imagine a substantial and verifiable unauthorized history of the spy agency.  Where would the author get his facts and how would he have verified them?  Of course, with an authorized history one is left wondering what's left out.  A whale of a post-war shadow is left by MI5's brilliant deception campaign -- in Churchill's phrase \\""the bodyguard of lies\\"" -- that protected Overlord.  If M15 was indeed so good at deception operations, one wonders, who else did they deceive after the Second World War?  Christopher Andrew doesn't tell us, of course.<br /><br />All in all this is well-worth reading.<br /><br />I think the best thing about it -- it's a lengthy slog, after all -- is a compelling argument that successful institutions take a long time to nourish, and successful institutional cultures need to be grounded in respect for ethics and values."

986,1,"Artisan publishing has had a long record of anti-seedline tracts & books (and, oddly enough, alot of PRO-British/Anglo-Israelism booklets aswell). However, after reading thisa book, i easily seen the \\""old\\"" arguments people have been using to try & \\""disprove\\"" the 2 seedline theory since the middle ages. The \\""author\\"" of this \\""book\\"" clearly misrepresnts several MAJOR key arguments in the 2 seed theory, and argues against things 2 seedliners don't even teach (atleast in the 20th-21st centuries!)! In all, as an African-American Baptist pastor (for the last 17 years), whom knows the TRUTH about the 2 seedline theory, i can honestly say, that this book is nothing more than misunderstandings about a controversial religious doctrine, and a feeble atempt at another religion to try & \\""debunk\\"" it, via using \\""straw-man\\"" arguements (which have been used by so-called \\""Christians\\"" for years, on subjects such as Islam, Mormonism & Freemasonry). Look up \\""Shepherd's Chapel\\"" if you want the truth about the dual seed thory (NOT CALLED \\""serpent seed\\"" by followers, whom don't, \\""b.t.w.\\"", even believe the serpent was the father of Cain, but the \\""racial/family tree\\"" of \\""good & evil\\"", that of fallen angels, was his true paternal side. The author also pays WAY too much attention onto the King James Version, which we all know was a mideval translation of a centuries old text, in another language to boot! (this guy really needs a Strong's concordance), and he KNOWS NOTHING about figures of speech, which the Bible is FULL of (Judah's called a lion, Assyria a cedar tree, God a great fir tree, Christ is the tree of life, and it is PROVEN that Satan, the great dragon, the devil, lucifer, the \\""nachash\\"" was \\""that old serpent\\"". In short, the Hebrew manuscripts are clear, it was NOT a serpent, but the \\""nachash\\"" or Angel of Light/the light bearer Lucifer, an arch-angel. And Eve said she concieved a man from AN ANGEL of the Lord, and that angel's name was Samael or the \\""angel of death\\"" (ala lucifer). And as far as the \\""crush the heel\\"" quote referring to Abel & Cain, that, in my country slang, is pure \\""hogwash\\""! Nobody, and i mean nobody teaches this, everybody whom teaches the 2 seed theory teaches that the \\""heel\\"" was Christ, and the \\""head\\"" was Satan. Yet another stawman. And Cain DID have a tribe of people, the KENITES, in Hebrew, the \\""sons of Cain. and Cain himself became \\""King Sargon of Akkad\\"" in later years, Sargon meaning Cain. Also, he seems to make up a doctrine 2 seedliners also have NEVER taught, that Adam passed on homosexuality via the sin in the Garden, however, most seedliners teach that it was Lilith whom layed with Adam (because she was also of the FAMILY TREE of good & evil, the line of fallen angels). Some more false doctrines the writer relies heavily on, is the \\""global Noah's flood\\"", which the Bible does not teach in the original Hebrew scripts, and furthermore, science has already disproven this aswell, it is impossible. And on this note, the author of this book also teaches the whole \\""races evolved from hebrew Noah's white-Jewish sons less than 4,000 years ago\\"" doctrine, which, again, is TOTALLY FALSE. Science, which never contridicts the Bible, has proven, without a doubt, that the 3 main races (white, black & asian), are centuries old & have seperate lineages.

988,4,"As a Peace Corps Volunteer in Thailand during the mid-80's, never heard Dr. & Mrs. Holmes mentioned as former PC trainers nor the approaches per se.  After living in Thailand almost 3 years & marrried to a Thai for 25+, I can truly appreciate this work.  The technology 'computer class' refs are definitely outdated.  The thought bubbles are pithy & poignant.  So after some time, the central themes are tragic and truthful, as evident by the recent transecting of Thai society, ie yw v. red..  still trying to sort the caste-like system corroding like an old battery.  Voting rights, English media, tech devices & Thai migrant laborers abroad are transforming this generation.  Future decisions are carbonizing an effervescent culture.  The definition of being 'a Thai' may be changing.  I truly hope the good things remain which can be appreciated by all who value the uniqueness of such a culture."

993,5,"Poor misunderstood Emily Dickinson! I too said \\""What?\\"" when I started reading her poems in earnest a few weeks ago. But thanks to this biography, I'm far less bewildered than I was at first.<br /><br />Richard Sewell clued me in to Dickinson's metaphors, cadence, passions, obsessions, sense of humor - and her unconventional approach to cosmic questions. And he taught me to ignore the titles of her poems, all affixed by editors, and all limiting.<br /><br />This biography is a combination of critical help with reading Dickinson's poetry -- and a picture of her life and personality.<br /><br />Sewall's approach to actual biography is highly original. He maintains that, \\""The whole truth about Emily Dickinson will elude us always.\\"" There is too much myth. There are not enough verifiable facts. She was too protective of her privacy, and well-meaning relatives destroyed too many papers. So Sewall gets at the poet by describing her family, her friends, her mentors, the men she loved - and the intense relationships she had with them all. He effectively squashes the myth that she went into seclusion because of a love disaster. He portrays her as a confident artist with a strong sense of vocation who never let anything (love included) interfere with the poetry. To me, the portrait he paints is far more appealing than the tragic Emily Dickinson we meet elsewhere.<br /><br />So this is a wonderful book, but be warned:  it's almost overwhelmingly detailed. It's obvious that Sewall had trouble leaving anything out from his vast stores of knowledge about the poet. The biographer delivers Dickinson's life circuitously, perhaps following the poet's advice to \\""Tell the truth, but tell it slant --  / Success in Circuit lies.\\"" While most Dickinson scholars grope for certainties, Sewall is comfortable with probabilities and cautious scholarly deductions.<br /><br />Still, despite the heavy scholarship of this book, it does include all the juicy doings in Dickinson's inner circle: her brother's unhappy marriage, his extramarital affair, her sister's romantic disappointment, and her own repeated losses in friendship and love.<br /><br />I got this book from a university library, but I'd recommend buying it if you're serious about Dickinson. It's a keeper.other's unhappy marriage, his extramarital affair, her sister's romantic disappointment, and her own repeated losses in friendship and love.<br /><br />I got this book from a university library, but I'd recommend buying it if you're serious about Dickinson.

998,3,"Taking us behind the scenes of the world in which author Jessica Grose has forged her career, Sad Desk Salad gives a lighthearted insight into modern day tabloid journalism.<br /><br />Alex Lyons is a blogger for Chick Habit, an online zine site focusing on celebrity gossip, fashion, pithy social commentary and controversial opinion. Responsible for publishing a dozen or more posts a day, Alex obsessively browses through Twitter, Facebook, her RSS feeds and news sites for inspiration from her couch, churning out pieces designed to attract the attention of Chick Habit's readers. Sad Desk Salad traces a frenetic week in which Alex's desperate desire to meet her quota (1 million hits a month), creates a conflict between her real and virtual life.<br /><br />Caught up in her world of virtual drama, which includes being targeted by an anonymous 'hater' who sets up a blog \\""Breaking the Chick Habit\\"" Alex fails to recognise the changes in her self that are putting a strain on her relationship with her boyfriend and friends.<br />Her perspective warped by her immersion in a arena that rewards controversy, gossip and scandal mongering, it isn't until Alex posts a damning video that could do irreparable harm to the reputation of a young woman who is only a 'celebrity' by association with her politically ambitious mother that she is hit by a crisis of conscience and begins to reconsider what is important to her.<br /><br />Grose keeps things light in Sad Desk Salad, it is often funny and sharp but unfortunately the novel lacked the insight I had hoped for. The author's examination of the eroding boundaries between 'public' and 'private' arenas is superficial at best. Not exactly a surprise really considering the author's own background as a writer and editor at sites just like the fictional Chick Habit, but disappointing that the potential of such a relevant social issue was left unexplored.<br /><br />What Grose does do well is highlight society's growing obsession with virtual connections. Alex doesn't shower for days in the fear of missing an important text or email, her iPhone is her constant companion and her obsession with the virtual world overshadows her interactions with real people. Sadly Alex reminds me of at least a couple of women I know whose obsessive checking of Facebook and Twitter has stalled many a conversation.<br /><br />Sad Desk Salad (so titled in reference to the meal women most often consume as they browse the internet during lunch at their desks) is a quick contemporary read.

999,5,"I remember my 5th grade teacher, Mrs Flower, reading this to us years ago in installments during class daily.  All of us waited with baited breath to see what would happen next to this family.  This story shows a staggering amount of love, determination, fortitude and strength in a family, and being that it's children that are displaying this, well it is remarkable.  All these years later (and I'm 59), I still remember this story.  Now I want to read it to my grandson, and I hope he enjoys the excitement, and understands that with determination, you can scale mountains...literally!  I recommend this book to all..children and adults.  It's not a fun story, and at times it's very sad.  But very worth while."
1000,4,"I picked this book up when it was released, as a movie fan and someone who likes reading a good critique, and I found it entertaining, well-written and a little depressing. Mr. Hoberman basically ties two narrative themes together, America post 9-11 and the mass acceptance and introduction of non-celluloid or \\""Digital\\"" film. It is a little obtuse at times, quoting critics like Marshall Mcluhan with an ease and off-handedness that assumes the reader is at least passingly familiar with them, and the theme is relentlessly negative and there are liberal bon mots sprinkled through the text(the man is clearly not a fan of either post editing or the Bush administration) that seem unnecessary but, overall, it's a great critique of cinema from the last twelve years and isn't so academic to make it unreadable for the average ignoramus(like myself)."
1001,5,Very detailed account of person living with anxiety. I wish there were more helpful tips about overcoming anxiety in this book.
1002,5,"This is a rare book that integrates the results of cutting-edge field studies by psychologists with practical marketing techniques that focus on a consumer's, or a client's, basic needs.  Dr. Ingwer somehow manages to describe the results of technical field studies in terms that are accessible and easy to understand, apply those theoretical results to the development of a marketing plan and, ultimately, present actual, real-world examples of marketing campaigns where the techniques were used, both successfully and unsuccessfully.  The result is an insightful book that is useful in marketing to a broad spectrum of consumers, including (in my case) potential law firm clients.  As a bonus, the book is well-paced and an interesting read."
1003,4,"This is an engrossing compact book about various people at a Pittsburgh coroner's office, which covers a lot of ground in its 170 (minus index etc.) pages. A review noted the prose read as written by a reporter and I agree this as a whole advanced its cause -- a facts based approach, without too many flourishes, adds to the experience. The book is still largely focused on first person accounts, starting with an extended look at the first day of two young interns. I'm an amateur but the book reads as a serious work that knows its stuff.<br /><br />My only criticism really is that the interns don't only mostly disappear for chunks of time later on but the epilogue (written about three years later) don't update us on their status. Other people in the book are referenced, why not them? Seems strange."
1004,5,"I can't tell you how much weelicious has changed my life as a mother.  To be honest, I'm not great in the kitchen, and as a working mom, I don't really have time to be.  Weelicious has allowed me to easily boost my meal-making skills and I feel great about putting a healthy meal together for my husband and my two year old daughter.  The recipes in the book are quick, easy, and delicious (seriously).  So much so that my daughter helps me make almost everyone of them.  It's become a thing we do together.  McCord's commentary is easy to read and entertaining (if your interested), and like many cookbooks- the pictures and graphics are beautiful.<br /><br />Another bonus, this is my new go-to present for mommies.  It's practical, the recipes are healthy and do able, and it's beautifully presented...something every mom needs.  I highly recommend this book."
1005,5,"Bonnye Matthews' exhaustive work left my mind full of new considerations and questions about the life and society of our early ancestors, the Neanderthals. There have been many newer theories regarding their levels of intelligence, compassion and social structure, and Bonnye's obvious in-depth research has utilized these and her own innate intelligence to create a full and rich possible reality for the Neanderthals, far removed from the early assumptions that they were brute creatures of low intelligence, troglodytes, or to use a simple term, Cavemen.<br /> She has also spun a wonderful tale of life in more primitive times, though primitive, in this case, means just lacking in all the complex and often confusing items and substances of this cyber age. But, to survive and thrive in such a brutal environment meant the need for a high level of intelligence to understand and deal with whatever confronted them. Their belief in a higher being, Wisdom, would not surprise me, and it might show that they were more cognizant of such things than some modern humans are.<br /> Ms. Matthews characters are beautifully created in painstaking details, regarding their personalities and in their belief system and how it formed their mores. Her descriptions of their environment are also finely and accurately depicted. This is a book well worth reading for those interested in our human ancestry and readers who appreciate a colorful, exciting, and well-defined major work."

As he walks through the configuration he offers the reasoning for the various setting values backed by real-world production experience.  This saved me countless hours of trial and error as we setup our first HBase cluster."
1007,5,"When I saw this book on a friend's table I was very curious because of the title. She explained a bit about the background and how she had happened to get to know about the book.  She had ordered hers from Amazon so I went home and did the same. I did so because I read the first chapter at her house and realised that friends of mine probably knew a bit about the area.  I was really wanting to know what they thought about the book so I gave them the book, and yes, I could not have been closer to the truth.  My friends are quite closely connected to the area and, indirctly, to the author.  So I'm looking forward to finishing the book after they have taken it to Greece on holiday. I enjoy the personal touch and short sections. I'd really like to write a book like this myself."
1008,4,"Like all the nutshells, this is very easy to follow.  I was about to register and pay $200 for an all-day CLE on this topic, which would have flown through each topic.

This book is arguably one of Ojaide's best poetry collections."

1014,4,"I'm a bit of a grouchy grumbler and purchased this book, along with Seligman's \\""What You Can Change and What You Can't\\"", out of curiosity -- just wondering what \\""positive psychology\\"" is all about and whether it could really make a difference in helping me overcome my perpetual negativity.  Essentially, Seligman posits that we can improve our own well-being by being more positive -- expressing gratitude regularly, saying thank you (and finding things to say thank you for), expressing joy in other's achievements -- can enhance our own well-being.  Do these things -- and your life will be better.  Flourish contains a number of specific, concrete exercises one can perform to become more positive and have enhanced well-being.  And the book is not about happiness per se -- though I imagine Seligman as a somewhat happy, chirpy, smiling fellow -- it's about well-being, which includes deeper content.  There is an understanding that \\""happiness\\""' per se is not necessarily an ideal to strive for.  Our lives are more meaningful with content and purpose, focus, not just \\""happiness.\\""<br /><br />Seligman does make a compelling case for positive psychology, and the approach can no doubt lead to improvements on an institutional level.  Despite the good content, I think the approach is a bit simplistic, particularly for people who are dealing with issues of depression and other mental illnesses.  I just kept thinking of \\""Gray skies are gonna clear up -- put on a happy face.\\""  It's not always that easy, particularly when life is full of challenges.  Sometimes it is a really struggle to find things to be thankful for.  I think the approach is a bit simplistic, useful within limita.<br /><br />I also agree with many of the other reviewers sho found Seligman to be a bit self-congratulatory, going on and on about his own achievements and the amazing people he has drawn into the positive psychology fold -- but I found the anecdotes about the successes of his approach to be entertaining.<br /><br />Overall, this is not a perfect book, but it provides plenty of guidance on concrete, specific steps one can take to try to enhance one's own well-being./><br />Overall, this is not a perfect book, but it provides plenty of guidance on concrete, specific steps one can take to try to enhance one's own well-being."

1016,3,"This is a pretty good book. It gives a lot of really good insights into Dispensationalism and Covenant Theology and how they are closer than you think. I am not completely sold on some of his exegesis, but he deserves a lot of credit for recognizing the unity of Law and Gospel and for stirring a lot of conversations that came later on. The book is very technical and dry however. Most of the value of the book lies in the conversations it started in the evangelical world, but its still a very interesting read with an interesting exegesis of Romans 10 and Galatians 3."
1017,5,"Slater, a therapist who has suffered from mental illness of her own, recounts stories of treating severely mentally ill patients. She tries to show that the severely mentally ill yearn for friendship, love, and companionship just as much as their healthier counterparts do. This hardly sounds groundbreaking, but it does contradict certain psychological treatises-- most notably, Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Slater works with severely schizophrenic men. These men suffer hallucinations, their linguistic abilities have been stolen by disease, they are sometimes catatonic. In these conditions Slater uses talk therapy to find desire for connection, though it is often deeply hidden.<br /><br />Slater manages to convey the sadness and despair that surround profound mental illness, though there are glimmers of hope too. The writing in this book is too florid at times, but Slater always approaches her subjects with grace and humanity. I enjoyed Slater's discussion of her academic training and the theoretical universe in which she works. Readers get to see how she uses academic training to make treatment decisions. We get to see how she thinks as a practitioner. This is a fascinating memoir, though perhaps not as groundbreaking as it was in 1996."
1018,5,This book has a great story line!  There were several plot twists that caught me by surprise.  So much potential for a sequel!
1019,4,"A Texan's Honor, the second installment of The Heart of a Hero series, was just as good as I expected! The author gives readers quite the intro with a train robbery, murder, and hostages, and it continues to get better from there. Regardless of the fact that Will is part of the gang that held up the train, Jamilyn feels a connection to him and trusts him to help her. She knows it's a huge risk to believe in Will but feels she has no other option.<br /><br />Shelley Gray delivers a wonderful book, and I loved the mix of romance and action. At times, I couldn't quite figure out where the story was going, but each time, the author filled in the gaps and brought everything together. She also wove together two stories--those of Will and Jamilyn and of Scout Proffitt. After getting to know Scout a bit, I'm hoping he will be featured in the next book in the series (and that we'll get to connect with Clayton again too!). Historical romance fans will be thrilled with A Texan's Honor! [# stars]<br /><br />I received a free copy of this book from Abingdon Press via Net Galley in exchange for my fair and honest review."
1020,5,"This book has outstanding organization, concise and clear writing, and makes points crystal clear with impressive images and screen captures that are labeled beautifully.  It is no surprise that the author, Steve Laskevitch, is an experienced teacher and trainer. In actuality this book is a class covering how to use the most sophisticated image editing tools available, Photoshop CS6 and Lightroom 4. This book serves a beginner well because it introduces important terms and even how to set up software preferences so that the user can get the most out of their experience. The explanations give you a solid understanding with careful efficiency.<br /><br />The illustrations throughout are second to none. On page 53 there is a 3-D illustration that is the best I have ever seen to teach the concept of layers in Photoshop. It slices a multi-layered file in Photoshop and labels it to perfection. Screen captures also do a fantastic job of showing the reader what is happening in a given window. Laskevitch takes great effort to label and highlight the points that he is trying to illustrate.<br /><br />After the introduction, the author offers a logical workflow that provides the structure for the majority of his book. He begins with \\""Capture & Import,\\"" progressing to \\""Organize and Archive,\\"" \\""Global Adjustments,\\"" \\""Local Adjustments,\\"" \\""Cleanup & Retouching,\\"" \\""Creative Edits & Alternates,\\"" and finishes with \\""Output.\\"" This works well because it allows the reader to \\""chunk\\"" a manageable set of steps and tools to practice before moving on to what would be a sensible next step. Get through the whole book and you are well on your way to producing satisfying quality work.<br /><br />This book is also comprehensive without being overwhelming. A beginner, would be able to have a strong grasp of how to use a large portion of what Photoshop CS6, with Adobe Camera Raw, and Lightroom 4 has to offer. More advanced users of Photoshop will find that this book serves them as an up to date reference for the newest features offered in the Adobe products covered. One thing I learned was how to dodge and burn without using the traditional Photoshop tools that I have used for years, the dodge and burn tools. On pages 200-203. Laskevitch uses an intelligent non-destructive technique using Curves adjustment layers and masking to dodge and burn. The masking method allows you to repeatedly adjust the image without destroying a single pixel. I think a lot of long-time users of Photoshop and Lightroom are likely to find a few new tricks they may have overlooked by buying this book.<br /><br />This book is for someone who wants to learn a step-by-step process to craft a photographic image like a professional. As a rabid consumer of Photoshop books, manuals, magazines, and on-line training, if I could only have one item Photoshop CS6 and Lightroom 4: A Photographer's Handbook by Steve Laskevitch would be the best choice!"

1025,4,"My copy of Peter Moruzzi's last gem just arrived and come September I'll have a complete set!!<br /><br />While more moderate in scope than his book \\""Havana...\\"", a bible for those interested in the socio-political construct that was Havana before the Cuvan Revolution, \\""Palm Springs Holiday\\"" offers the subject matter the same in-depth treatment, absolutely saturating the reader in the culture and color of the time.<br /><br />This gorgeous tome BRIMS with fabulous images and stories, serving in many cases as the sole unifying historical record of a time and place that was such an incredibly massive part of the \\""American Experience\\"" of the period.<br /><br />Moruzzi, an art historian and expert on mid-century 'modern' architecture, sprinkles architectural history throughout every chapter of the book, offering lively discussion on styles from Spanish Colonial Revival to Rustic Ranch, but his chapter dedicated to 'Desert Modern' styles and techniques, influences that would become so very prominent in much if the rest of the country in the third quarter of the century, provides the reader with a depth of understanding uncommon in what may initially be seen as a coffee-table book.<br /><br />Whether intentional or not, Mr. Moruzzi treats this subject with more personal input than his previous book.  That is to say, one gets a sense, going from page-to-page, less of reading an historical analysis on the art and architecture of the times, and more like they are listening to an educational newsreel (possibly one produced by the Chamber of Commerce?) on the Coachella Valley area.  If this rowdy, delicious book had been assembled by anyone else I don't think it would have come off as well as it did, but the author does such a splendid job of setting the stage and pulling the characters together (the hotels, the visionaries, the scenery) that it would almost seem academically-heavy if not for his occasional tongue-in-cheek observations. .<br /><br />Why not 5 stars?  Simply put, while a terrifically interesting look at a colorful, sometimes pivotal, often kitschy period of sun, fun, and fashion, I don't personally see it as a 5-star subject, and that's okay. Mr. Moruzzi's presentation through photos and stories truly brings this corner of history to life.  The book is just a joy, and makes me anxious for his next offering.

There is SO much repetition and drivel (we get it, he has big, strong biceps and you like it when he takes charge). I kept reading, thinking it has to get better, but sadly, it never really did. I'm used to Anne Tyler and Anna Quinlden, John Irving, Anne Lamott, etc., and am also used to real plot lines and gripping storytelling. I DID find, that the last quarter of the book, when Ree had her baby and lived on the ranch, things picked up in her ability to be an author and storyteller, but I don't think one should have to wait until the last pages of a book to find it meaty and worthy of a read.<br /><br />And lastly, I found her to be a selfish, spoiled, self-obsessed woman. Her bratty interactions with her disabled brother and lack of true empathy and concern for others tragedies and tribulations (such as the dissolution of her parents' marriage), was disconcerting to say the least. I'm sure ranch life has humbled her and wish her the best, but won't be reading any more from her."
1027,5,"I love great business and \\""how things got started!\\"" books And I love great sports books.  Take a shot is a truly rare combination of both - a book about chutzpah, guts and sheer determination...in business, in life and in sports.  It was a fast, engaging read from beginning to end full of wit and important life lessons alike.  I've never seen a lacrosse game before, but I want to now.  I highly recommend this book."
1028,5,I love the crisp blackline masters.  They are simple and straightforward to understand.  I teach first grade and I'm using this book even though it's listed as 2-4.
1029,5,"If you enjoy Cindy Gerard as an author I guarantee that you will love the series written by Christy Reece.<br /><br />A fast and pact novel with strong characters.  You will loose yourself in the story, form strong attachments to the characters and want to read the next in the series!<br />Highly recommend this and all of the books in Christy Reece's series."
1030,2,"This book was assigned to me for my political science class, it's an informative book over the issues on women rights and how their still is segregation. Martha Burk is a very passionate feminist who encourages women to get out there and have a voice. It informs you on various basic political issues, I think it's a good book for a class discussion. She touches on the subjects of abortions, civil rights, prohibition, birth control and a lot others subject that most students should be aware of. I'm glad I read this book it has motivated me to get active in my community and be more aware of all the issues women go through."
1031,3,"this book  yearns to  cover a whole era  through selective vision  and  it  leaves  for  some interesting takes  and yet it leaves  some empty spots as well. the  book  wants to  tell  the story of the  60's and tie things together to the movement and moments of today.  this  book  has  some good moments,however  it never  quite land that knock out punch  where  it fully makes a  statement, still nevertheless  its a  interesting read and journey."
1032,5,The story of Dee's life written as a letter to her Grandson is so powerful.  The courage and strength it must have taken Ms Stephens to write her story in an effort to help Ryan some day deal with lifes challenges touched my heart.

1035,5,"Malaika Mapembe is a young, Tanzanian woman who falls in love with an American Peace Corps volunteer named Paul Mondeson after he arrives in Tanzania to teach at a remote inland school. Swallowed up in the eddies of political conspiracy theories, social frictions, witchcraft, misunderstandings and imprisonment, the couple gets separated, and Malaika is informed that Paul has died of malaria while under arrest. However, after scrutinizing his journals several years after moving to America, she comes to suspect that that may not have been the case, and that things are not what they appear to be. Anxious to discover the truth, she returns to Tanzania to find out the real reason behind her husband's death, and in the process revisits her past as she tries to make sense of it all. The plot is a beautifully woven tapestry of time, choices, premonition and fate.    The characters in the book are very convincingly developed. I could picture the various people looking a certain way, behaving in a certain fashion, with all their quirks and nuances. Malaika and Paul are opposites in some ways, Paul symbolic of America's schedule- and ambition-driven, quick fix culture, and Malaika of Africa's infatuation with all things American, and their respective temptations cost them dearly and slide them down the slippery slope of ambiguous ethics. The characters Valerie and Yusuf, on the other hand, while not very appealing at first, have some redeeming qualities. Valerie, while seemingly unscrupulous, has one saving grace - to &#34;tell the truth and to be true to herself&#34; (like me!). Yusuf, while old and feeble and seemingly useless, has a strong sense of loyalty and of right and wrong, and proves to be a valuable source of insight into the fog of mystery surrounding Paul. Even minor characters come marvelously to life through the author's depictions. I enjoyed the personality of the wily goatherd who confounded the diplomatic officials, and Higgy's &#34;ponderous&#34; lechery had me chuckling long afterwards.    The literary style (having tuned out the occasional foul language and vulgar epithets that tend to mainly come out of Malaika's mouth) is spectacular and very evocative. The descriptive sections made me laugh out loud, sigh dreamily, get lost in pensive thought, reel in shock, or get misty-eyed. One beautiful sentence still lingers in my mind: &#34;I have thoughts that are not yet thoughts, but unfocused terrors that rise unbidden out of a miasma of conscience, like the spiraling mist you will find in the early morning eucalyptus forests north of Moshi&#34;. In another instance, the vision conjured up of a Tanzanian cook rolling meatballs on his bare, sweaty, hairy chest in the tropical heat while cooking for a group of unsuspecting expatriates was hilarious. The depiction and flow of interpersonal exchanges, social dynamics and internal psychology are pure magic. Having grown up in Tanzania in the 80s, I can say that the incredibly stunning level of detail and vivid portrayal of the people, place and culture are very true to the land and time period, and give the story an extremely realistic feel. Reading the story made me feel like I had stepped back into Tanzania, surrounded by the lush vegetation, decaying poverty juxtaposed with manicured wealth, and multifaceted cultures of both the local and expatriate populations. There are several actual landmarks and a few political figures and events that feature in the book, which lend to the realism. In fact, there is a gigantic baobab tree like the one that features on the front cover of the book in the very spot (off Kenyatta Drive near the Indian Ocean) that the author mentions in the story. Shakespeare's play &#34;The Tempest&#34; is referenced often and used as a metaphor e.g. references to the characters Prospero, Ferdinand and Caliban, all aspects of Paul, the name of the enchanted island &#34;Bermuthas&#34; that is given to Malaika and Paul's home.    One of the themes of thebook is the contrast between appearance and reality. A line from Edgar Allan Poe's poem comes to mind: &#34;All that we see or seem, is but a dream within a dream.&#34; An associated theme is the cost of secrecy and deception in what could otherwise be beautiful, honest, enduring relationships in a corrupt world. Another theme is the succumbing to temptation or personal folly being one's undoing in the end. The author writes very profoundly, and I got the sense that some of the thoughts expressed were his very own personal ones due to the depth and intensity in the writing. American and African cultures are compared and contrasted, and there is ample and striking irony when it comes to the concepts of civilization and progress in the two lifestyles. The ramifications of socialism on the local economy and the Tanzanian psyche, as well as the related temptation to indulge in corrupt practices are also explored. The notion of corruption brings up interesting moral questions: does performing illegal activities for a good cause make one corrupt and worthy of punishment? And if corruption is part of the system that all of society accepts and partakes in, then does that make the laws that the very society created invalid? The efficacy of witchcraft is speculated upon: does witchcraft work because the spells cause real physical effects, or does it work because people believe it works? A prominent theme from beginning to end is the idea of one being responsible for one's lot in life, articulated by Paul's quote of his father's words, &#34;If it is to be, it is up to me.&#34;    As for how the book affected me and what I took away ... the book left me with goosebumps the first time, and feeling somewhat surreal the second, as if I had stepped back out from another world. The haunting story confirmed my longstanding belief that life can genuinely be better if we choose to make it so without selling our souls in the process, and that our destiny is in our hands if we have the wisdom and humility to see that we are its primary architects.    The author is a brilliant, gifted writer and among the most talented I know.

1036,5,This is a pretty good book for basic Geometry questions.  It has great step by step explanations.  It came in perfect condition and was shipped immediately.
1037,3,"This is a book that addresses grief, the processes, identifying it and handling it as well as other different issues. Getting rid of heartbreak, for example, in our lives while bring in nourishment for strengthing our faith. Also contained within the authors experiences with grief, life and everything in between, also has ways of addressing the readers own grumble issues; hallelujah prayers and questions for reflection and discussion after each chapter.<br /><br />Upbeat, modern, humorous and beneficial is how I would describe Grumble Hallelujah. I feel it would be a book befitting a person suffering from grief, especially a young person. Some of the author's suggestions have merit, there are points addressed in this book that she elaborates on. Being very honest, the author discusses in detail her faults and shortcomings letting the reader know that they are not the only ones who are going through difficult times. The book is divided into different sections, the reader can decide which part is more suiting to their needs, part three was most helpful to me which addresses jealousy, competition and judgement. Overall I did enjoy this book."
1038,4,"I really liked the idea behind this novel... Lincoln survives the assassination attempt... and now has to face the politics of the war between the states.  A great variation on the \\""What if this had happened...\\"" premise.  If you are into history and especially civil war era, all the big names are involved.  Should you read this book?  My thoughts are that if you are looking for historical accuracy probably not...  but if you are just looking to be entertained by characters you know through history this could be the book for you.  Why 4 stars?  I honestly found it a little \\""soap opera-ish\\"".  That sort of rubbed me the wrong way, but I write this understanding that just because I found it off putting that doesn't mean that everyone would feel the same.  If you buy the book I hope you enjoy it and thank you for taking the time to read my review."
1039,4,"Really good book..a page turner.  hopefully there is going to be a part 2, if not i have to say the ending was incomplete."
1040,5,McGovern's debut novel is a well written page turner that grabs the reader from the start and doesn't let go.  The atmosphere of Boston is captured perfectly and Detective McGrath is a wonderful protagonist.  Full of twists and turns this is a great summer read.
1041,5,"I would highly recommend this book for anyone.  It was a great, easy read and left me more encouraged and inspired to please God.  After reading all the author has experienced and seeing how God has come through for her, I was encouraged to continue to live for God."

1044,5,"This is a love story of a family and their dogs. Written by national talk show host and attorney Mark R. Levin, he shares his love of dogs, particularly his rescue dog, Sprite.<br />Already sharing their home with Pepsi, a 6 year old mixed breed, the family decides to adopt a second dog from the local shelter. They fall in love with the adorable Sprite, believing him to be between 3-6 years old. He fits right in with the family, he and Pepsi becoming inseparable.<br />Weeks after adopting Sprite, he has an emergency and must be rushed to the animal hospital. This is followed by another incident shortly thereafter. The Levin family realizes Sprite is much older than originally believed, perhaps ten years or more! But this does not matter; he is family, and he needs them.<br />The next few years are spent loving Sprite and caring for him. The Levin family, including Pepsi, is forever changed by Sprite and his gentle spirit. Friends and listeners of Mark Levin's show are touched by Sprite's life and struggle.<br />We are reminded by the Levin family's story with Sprite of how much animals add to our lives, and how much we can learn from them, from their simple wisdom. This is a beautiful story that will stay with you, especially if you have had the joy and anguish of rescuing an elderly dog, as I have had.  It is indeed special."

1046,5,"Nothing beats a well drawn out plot and likable life like characters. although the book was published far before my time it earned the one award that makes me go after books like no other.

I went to my credit account company but the cant cancel the paiment.I WANT MY MONEY BACK. I WILL NEVER BUY AGAIN ON AMAZON.IT WAS MY FIRST AND LAST TIME.
1049,2,"The series had some promise in the beginning, but the last book seemed lazily put together. I was interested the first half of the book when they were trying to find the artifacts that had very little purpose in the end.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:<br /><br />I don't understand why Daniel and his gang couldn't have just told Luce that she was an angel, or maybe hinted at it so she could remember. It certainly would hurry the process along. And the fact that she remembered really didn't do anything for the plot. It all seemed like it was pulled together very hastily. The last 100 pages were strange and seemed very out of place with the rest of the series.<br /><br />The ending was happy and decent, but the way they got there was choppy. It seemed like the writer didn't really plan out this book and was just making things up as she went along."
1050,2,"**Doubleshot Reviews called upon a guest reviewer who is an elementary school teacher and mother to lend her expertise to reviewing Hand Puppet Horror**<br /><br />Hand Puppet Horror is a story of a 4th grade boy named Jay who makes a hand puppet during arts & crafts time at his school. Somehow, the hand puppet comes to life and it is clear right away, that he is not a friendly puppet! Jay immediately regrets making his puppet \\""Yeti Booger\\"" with such sharp teeth and other appendages. The story chronicles Jay and his two closest friends, Sammy and Becky as they learn to deal with the evil puppet and his antics. Towards the end of the book, we come to learn that Fred (another classmate) is a warlock who has put a curse on the hand puppet in an attempt to get back at Jay for a brief scare Jay had given him early on in the story.<br /><br />The concept of the cursed puppet is a good one that I think your average 3rd or 4th grader would find interesting. When it was presented to me, I was told I would be reviewing a book geared towards middle school students and while entertaining, the complexity of the story is far too juvenile for that age group. There were several great vocabulary words (again, appropriate for a 3rd or 4th grade level) which could be brought up in discussion groups in the classroom and added to students' personal vocabulary books. The illustrations scattered throughout the chapters were wonderful and brought an otherwise patchwork story together.<br /><br />Overall, the structure of the story seemed scattered. It definitely built to a climax but, I feel the actions leading up to and down from that climax were far too rushed and the beginning of the story was somewhat uneventful. There is a brief (half page) romantic encounter between Becky and Jay at the very end of the book that was not well placed or built up to. Sadly, the character development in the story didn't make you like or dislike any of the main players. I felt I was TOLD outright, how to feel about them but, didn't let me form my own opinion about each character. Very few 4th grade students that I have personally worked with would find Jay's character realistic. The story seemed to try too hard to paint a picture of a child's life. Jay's catchphrase is \\""Holy Knickerbockers\\"" which is fairly appropriate and accurate but, there is a dog in the story named \\""Stupid\\"" which in my class and most Elementary classrooms (in the three different states I've worked in) is akin to a curse word. My students would definitely make sure I knew that word was in the story and then later use it as a defense when they decided to say it in school.<br /><br />Finally, I had a really hard time with this book as a teacher, as there were at least half a dozen grammatical/spelling errors. I make it a point to provide my students with exemplary models of writing so, when they go to write their own stories they pay attention to such details as grammar, spelling and structure. I don't think I could use this book in that way in my classroom.<br /><br />In summation, while the concept and illustrations of Hand Puppet Horror were spot on and appropriate for a 3rd or 4th grade reader, the lack of character development, unrealistic depiction of the life of a young boy and multiple grammatical errors make this a story that will most likely not make it in my classroom library.feel about them but, didn't let me form my own opinion about each character.

1051,4,"I enjoyed this book and the series. My favorite book was the first one. This one wasn't what I expected but, it was still good. I sometime have trouble imagining the setting or what's going on because of the made up words. I like that Lasky does that thought. Not many authors can do that without sounding werid. At first I thought they were misspellings. This book was good but, I was hoping Faolan and Edeme would be mates. Maybe in the sixth book. If only Fengo didn't die then the watch could go on. And the Sark in my opinion was kinda crazy. This book was strange having Euo (or however you say Faolan's bear sprit name) and the owl. Why was she female? I found that werid. And I thought the bear cub \\""Toby\\"" was from the seekers series for a moment untill I realized that this is a totally different author. Overall I rate this book four out of five and would recommend it to anybody who likes to read and loves animals. If you like this book then you should look at the Nightshade City Book and The Mistmantle Chronicles not to forget the Warrior Cat Series."
1052,4,"Celluloid Mushroom Clouds is a solid, well-written critical analysis of the relationship between the military/government establishment and the Hollywood filmmaking establishment concerning the atomic bomb as a film subject from the bomb's development and use in World War II to its proliferation thereafter into the 1960s. The study is very well documented (I've purchased a couple more books because they were incorporated effectively into the text and listed in the sources section), increasing the value and effect of the book's overall analysis. The study makes a convincing case for strong ties between and enduring direct influence (not without ulterior movtives!) of and the shifting characterizations of the military and science as bomb movies (mostly B movies) were created, principally between late 40s and mid 60s.The text would have benefitted, strengthened its argument had analysis been given to a few more atomic bomb movies (however, the study does provide an extensive chronological list of atomic bmomb movies early on in its discussion). Celluloid Mushroom Clouds is, as intended, a strong academic study."
1053,5,"I am a big fan.  This book has everything, action, humor, more action, fantasy, action.  LOL!  You get the point.  An easy read by an Author who writes extremely well.  I have enjoyed this series tremendously and look forward to newer entries and other titles!  Keep'em coming!"
1054,5,"Imagine an outdoor market filled with cultures from around the world. The scents, sounds and colors would be intoxicating. Hunter and Fox is all that and more. I couldn't get enough of the peoples and cultures of Conhaero and the mystery of the White Void from which they came. As I read Hunter and Fox I found myself scrutinizing the details and always yearning for more.  Philippa Ballantine is easily a master world builder but it's the richness of her characters too that held my gaze, pulled on my emotions and kept me up all night.<br /><br />I enjoy reading Fantasy, but it's not always my first choice. Too often I feel like I'm reading the same books, only with different titles. Not so here. When I give a Fantasy novel 5 stars-as I did Hunter and Fox-then you know it's a cut above the rest. I immediately identified with the character Talyn the Dark. She's strong and ruthless, and does the Caisah's bidding. She's not a heroine. Or is she? Everything is open to interpretation and you soon learn there is more to Talyn's story, and everyone else's too. She's not alone in her struggle. There are many things hidden in Conhaero and they all begin to take shape at once. If I say anymore I'll start spilling spoilers!<br /><br />Hunter and Fox is only the first book in the Shifted World series, so don't expect everything to be resolved at the end. It's like an episode of Game of Thrones,  you'll be gasping at the end and wondering how the book could end there!"

1056,1,"This is maybe the worst book I have ever read. The science is laughable and the actual writing is terrible - it sounds like a 10th grader wrote it.

If you are interested in this genre, save yourself the trouble and just pick up any Peter Benchley novel instead."

The advice, a few miles short of stimulating.<br /><br />But if you push through and really take in the words and advice given in it, you will become a better writer.

1060,5,Love the book! I don't paticularly like to cook but I love to throw parties and especially like the decorating/theme part of the planning process.  It is amazing when you implement just the little touches that can make a party not just fun but fantastic and unforgetable!! Just flipping through the book and seeing the pictures for the first time I got some great ideas for my future parties! I am definetly going to be following Cheryl Style.  Bring it on!!
1061,5,It is a very easy to read textbook and what I need for my class. I will recommend it to everone.
1062,5,All the food I have been waiting to lose my weight to get back to and how to make it healthier!  As a southerner I have had a hard time giving up so many of our traditional foods.  They are in this cookbook and made the way southerners love to eat.  Thanks Weight Watcher!
1063,5,"I really enjoyed this book, it was such a delight to read. Nadine writes with such humour, I found myself laughing out loud. We moved down to Panama last year and built a house and I could understand some of her experiences as we had some of the same. Great read!"
1064,4,"\\""Sunrise on The Battery\\"" is a very thought-provoking book. Mary Lynn has every material thing she could ever want. She joins a Bible study, has a change of heart, and begins praying for the same in her husband, Jackson.<br /><br />As the story unfolds Jackson's change of heart becomes more than Mary Lynn bargained for. Mary Lynn begins to question whether material wealth can offer as much as strong conviction.<br /><br />Beth Webb Hart paints a vivid picture of Charleston, South Carolina while she weaves a heavy story that stays with you after the book is closed.<br /><br />* I received this book free for review from Thomas Nelson Publishers*"
1065,5,"Stan Rowe (1918-2004) was a Canadian scholar whose career meandered from forestry, to botany, and finally to ecological ethics -- a new field of study in which he gained attention for his outside-the-box thinking.  His book Earth Alive is a collection of essays that explore the importance of ecocentrism, a mode of thinking that embraces the entire planet, and is committed to its healing and wellbeing.<br /><br />Ecocentrism is a healthy alternative to the worldview that's killing the ecosystem -- humanism.  Almost everyone in the modern world suffers to some degree from morbid humanism, a belief that humans were created in the image of God, are the best and the greatest, and can do whatever they wish with the Earth, because God made it just for them.  \\""Among infantile beliefs, the idea that Earth was made for the pleasure and profit of the human species ranks first.\\""  It's like worshipping sacred fish while rendering their pond uninhabitable via toxic pollution.<br /><br />Rowe was careful to distinguish between biocentric (yuk!) and ecocentric (yum!).  A biocentric view is limited to living organisms only.  But life is far more than organisms.  Organisms cannot survive without sunlight, air, water, and soil.  Ecocentric embraces the whole enchilada.  We need to care about everything.  Rowe recommended that we call ourselves Earthlings, so that we could form an identity with this planet, the mother of our existence.  We should think of ourselves as Earthlings first, and humans second.<br /><br />In his college years, Rowe studied prairies, and they fascinated him.  The wild prairies of Nebraska were essentially unchanged by the passage of thousands of years, while the lands of his European ancestors were a never-ending hell broth of raiding, raping, pillaging, and ecological destruction.  During the `40s, his professor was horrified to watch the sacred prairies plowed out of existence and converted into cropland.  A precious treasure was senselessly destroyed, and the health of the land was diminished with each pass of the tractor.  Ecocentric Earthlings naturally harbor a deep and passionate contempt for agriculture.<br /><br />Agriculture was the most radical change in Earthling life since we learned to control fire, and it led to the emergence of cities and civilizations.  Cities are absolutely unsustainable.  The average adult spends 95 percent of his life indoors, and the new world of digital telecommunication isolates us even farther from the family of life.  Eco-psychologists refer this alienation as EDD, Earth Deficiency Disease.<br /><br />Cities are also crazy.  Urban culture is a nightmare of unsustainable fantasies that are completely disconnected from ecological reality.  \\""In short, Western culture -- more and more city-based, further and further removed from any grounding in Earth-wisdom -- systematically drives its citizens insane.  A society that renders its citizens mad must itself be mad.\\""<br /><br />Earthlings should regard nature as being sacred, so we will treat it with care and respect.  Instead, we indulge in magical thinking about \\""sustainability\\"" and \\""good stewardship.\\""  But in the real world, we are heading for disaster because our God-word is \\""growth.\\""  We will not protect what we do not love.<br /><br />Ideally, everyone should live in wild places, surrounded by nature.  But the herd is migrating to cities.  \\""The city is an unhealthy place for those who want to come home at least once before they die.\\""  Not surprisingly, soon after Rowe retired, he promptly abandoned the big city and moved to a remote and gorgeous hamlet, population: 650.  He had a powerful love for the natural world, and he enjoyed walking. (\\""Our two best doctors are our legs.\\"")<br /><br />Children are far more open to forming a bond with the natural world, if they are ever exposed to it.  This bond is a normal and healthy Earthling experience, and it can last a lifetime.  What is not normal is growing up in a humanist culture, where they unconsciously absorb the toxic worldview by osmosis.  Humanist education is a central cause of the problem, because it devotes little or no attention to ecology or natural history.  Illiterate people harm the planet far less than the well-educated.  And multinational religions tend to direct our attention away from the living creation that surrounds us, and have us look inward, to contemplate other-worldly dimensions.<br /><br />The humanist culture is extremely proud of the wonders of modern technology.  Modern living is seen to be a great advancement over the primitive lives of our hunter-gatherer ancestors.  But is it really?  Not if our standards of judgment focus on sustainability -- by far the best standard of excellence and high intelligence.  Self-destructive cultures are for losers, despite their smart phones and big screen TVs.<br /><br />Our pre-civilized ancestors had an ecocentric worldview. But modern Earthlings can't acquire a healthier worldview by popping a pill, watching a PowerPoint presentation, or reading anthropology books.  A good worldview is rooted in place, and consumer society resides in a placeless world, where every main street looks the same (McDonalds, Wal-Mart, Toyota...).  Healthy change will take time.<br /><br />What can we do?  Rowe concluded this book with A Manifesto for Earth, in which he describes the changes needed, none of which are quick and easy.  Humanism simply has no long-term future, it's a dead end.  We need ecocentric spirituality, ecocentric education, and ecocentric living.  We need to escape from our miserable boxes, race outdoors, and return home.<br /><br />For most of us, our worldview is as invisible as the air we breathe.  We accept it without question and rarely think about it.  Our entire society is on the same channel, everywhere we go, which reinforces the misconception that our worldview is normal.<br /><br />Green thinkers are searching for a new vision, but it's really not a great hidden mystery.  Rowe shouts the obvious:  \\""Look!  The new vision surrounds us in the trees and the flowers, in the clouds and the rivers, in the mountains and the sea....  The new vision is out there and always has been.  It is the spring of inspiration, the source of whatever good has been discovered within the human mind.\\""<br /><br />Richard Adrian Reese<br />Author of What Is Sustainablere they unconsciously absorb the toxic worldview by osmosis.

1066,2,"I received this book as a gift and was excited to finally have time to use it.  I chose the Millefiori pattern in size 9 months, traced and cut the patterns, and got to work.  However, what I quickly discovered after a number of hours of work was that the pant leg patterns just didn't match up.  I quadruple-checked my work to make sure I'd cut the right patterns and I had.  I fudged through the pant portion and continued.  Then, I found that the bodice and pant portion didn't match up, forcing me to put gathers on the sides (which are mostly hidden due to the skirt portion of the outfit).  When all was said and done, after many modifications to the pattern to make everything line up, the outfit didn't fit my small daughter.  The modifications I had to make to the pants put the crotch up too high so the shoulder straps pull very tightly.<br /><br />Another minor negative are the directions.  There were some points where I had to infer directions if it didn't state something explicitly.<br /><br />I gave the book 2 stars because it has some really cute patterns.  But don't expect to go through this pattern without modifications.<br /><br />I can't speak to any other patterns in this book."
1067,5,"This is one of the most heart touching, inspirational books I have ever read.  You will find yourself laughing and crying at the same time.  I didn't know Joan O'Brien, but I sure wish I had.  What an amazing true story about a wonderful woman who was an unbelievable mother, wife, friend and philanthropist.  I am still in \\""awe\\"" from her story.  Thank you Joan for sharing your life through this wonderfully written book.  May you rest in peace and be in God's arms."
