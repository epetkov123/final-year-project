0,5,This CD has multiple versions of &#34;Let's Get Loud&#34;; so I can really get my salsa on.  I LOVE it!  It exceeded my expectations.  Was also delivered rather quickly.
1,5,Amazing piece of art. People who use to listen to sufi songs in Aleppo during Zikr session will start crying when listing to such songs. Good job and wish we can have more.
2,5,"Forty years on and still rockin' strong!  This is Motorhead's 22nd studio album.  And this year marks the band's 40th year.  This is the reason, I guess, for the four XXXXs on the cover.  The cover also looks like some kind of war medal, maybe it represents the Medal of Valor for Mean and Lean Rock'n'Roll.  Anyway, this album is pretty similar to the last five studio albums, i.e., since Inferno, in that Cameron Webb produced this one and the last five.  And the major players are the same, Lemmy, Phil, and Mikkey, as they have been for the last 20 years.  In other words, the album does not disappoint.  A major surprise is the last cut, Sympathy with the Devil, which I thought would be sub-par but Mikkey Dee does some incredible drumming that kicks this song up a notch.  Phil's guitar work on this track is outstanding as well. The whole album is a pleasant surprise."
3,5,A+
4,5,One of the better alblums I have bought in a long time. Good range of songs.
5,5,"Was kind of disappointed that this was not the newly remastered 2014 version, but this is a cool picture disc. Looking back at description this was listed as the picture disc so that was my fault"
6,5,as expected
7,5,I love this band and this album. I haven't stopped listening to it since I bought it. I would recommend this to any La Oreja de Van Gogh fan!
8,5,Great sounds from the 70's
9,5,Rich. Beautiful. Intense yet gentle enough to read to.
10,5,Legendary!
11,5,Love it! It is a product that meets its expectations and that's all I want!
12,5,"It's good that Maria Anna Walburga Ignatia Mozart - otherwise known as Nannerl - is coming into her own. She was clearly an important figure in her brother's life and no mean musician in herself (she spotted a weakness in a cadenza of K 451 which Wolfgang duly acknowledged). She preserved the family correspondence. Better still, she inspired the Septet that bears her name (K 251 - arguably the most Mozartian work in K&ouml;chel) and the Concerto for Two Pianos (K 365); how many of us could say as much? The union is enshrined everlastingly in the coda of K 365's Andante where the keyboards address one another as afterglow.<br /><br />Reader, this is a fabulous disc on all fronts. This is what it means to make music. It offers two masterpieces - K 365 and K 608 - and two instances where Mozart speaks more to his own time than ours (K 242 and K 501). First and foremost, it includes Mozart's expanded orchestration of K 365 where he added clarinets, trumpets and timpani (they're excluded in Bohm / Gilels & Brendel / Cooper/Marriner). The English Chamber Orchestra, beefed up in consequence, for once sounds like something more than a welter-weight outfit. While I'm not a fan of Perahia's Mozart - I find it somewhat faceless and safe - the presence of Lupu sparks fire from Uncle Murray. With flare and authority, both pianists evoke the full sonority of the Steinways at their command. Charm and power are conjugal. In Einstein's estimation, K 608 was Mozart's last reckoning with Johann Sebastian Bach; for once, it's played like the cosmic statement that it is. The appeal of K 242 is maximized.<br /><br />In summary, this is a captivating affair. Superlatives become it. Gun stuff!"
13,5,Here's a collection of some of the truly greatest Wagner singers......better than sitting through four interminable hourse to hear some outstanding arias without having to swallow mouthfulls of oceanic waves.....<br /><br />Basso di Cornetto
14,5,Brought back memories as tenor sax player with &#34;The Syndicate&#34; during 1965-1966.  &#34;JAJ&#34; was the first song I ever learned on the sax (played by ear after four years clarinet in school band).  &#34;Busybody&#34; was one of the favorite songs we did.  We also had a trumpet/sax combination.
15,5,great dealings!!!
16,5,Original cast album of a Broadway Classic.<br />Tracks are listed in the description.
17,5,"Really Red is an awesome and seldom known early Texas punk band. Their playing is tight and energetic, with a nod to the more political side of life lyrically. You would never be able to find almost any of this material without seriously dishing out some serious bucks. This comp of virtually all their work is a must have for any would-be punk young or old."
18,5,"I have to say that this is my favorite Fela Kuti disc so far.  I was introduced to this music with his greatest hits double cd, Best of the Black President, which is a gate way drug to his entire catalogue.  The horn play on these songs are truly epic.  It's hard for me to pull this disc outta my car player even though I've got Monkey/Banana, Alagbon Close, Kalakuta Show, Open & Close (which is way down my playlist),  and Teacher Don't Teach Me Nonsense (which is even further).  The jazz/afro beat elements are truly sublime on tracks 2 & 4.  Buy best of the black prez first, and if you feel it then this will elevate.  BTW, this has got to be the best long distance running music ever!"
19,5,my daughter loved the album
20,5,"I bought this for my daughter, who is a massage therapy student, to play for clients to listen to during massages.  Perfect length.  Relaxing music.  She (and they) love(s) it!"
21,5,The Leibesleider Waltzs was exactly what I wanted
22,5,Great price
23,4,"Good sound, clear and I love it"
24,2,"Regarding audio quality I'm really disappointed by this disc.  I expected a lot more.  Cyberpunk sounds great, this one is a couple steps backwards and seems clearly mixed for car stereos.  It's muddy all the way through.  If you're looking for good audio for a quality home stereo, pass on this disc."
25,5,"i love this band and lost the orignal albums over the years from moving around etc,so finding all 3 of there albums on amazon was great !!!!!"
26,5,The tempo is medium and the music is familiar so it's a good workout cd.
27,4,I like Joe...I like Joe alot....Dust Bowl is ok by me.
28,5,Very good ambiance music.  Really very beautiful!
29,5,"I have always loved Enrique so this was a great purchase for me.......husband not happy, but let the music play! LOL"
30,5,Awesome band and songs !!! Melodic rock doesn't get any better than this!!!!! Steve plunkett is a awesome lead singer!!!!!
31,5,"Leon Bridges has the smoothest voice, and the songs are all great.  There isn't a bad song on the album."
32,5,Nice rockabilly and rock and roll from a classic artist.
33,4,good
34,5,Nice collection of songs for Billy Cowsill benefit.  Good album for collectors.
35,5,"This entire CD is perfect. It is mostly made up of slower songs, but based off what the album is about, that is to be expected. There are however, still a few fast paced songs to lighten the mood. Sam Smith has a unique voice and he's very talented at creating songs based around it. Can't wait till he comes out with a new album, I will definitely be in line to buy it."
36,5,Muse is restoring my faith in music again.
37,5,He takes your breath away. Try not to miss him when he tours in your area.
38,5,"Great stuff.  I was interested in his music after hearing his interview on Fresh Air, and that he was influenced by Jimmy Rogers.  I'm really a fan of regional music, and this is a bit too cool for me, but my son really liked it, and it was a great gift for him."
39,5,"for fans of dinosaur jr, and the gun club..with a little help from the tree people?? lol pretty good stuff from Olympia WA!!"
40,5,Love Is All We Need by Vic Dana  is a fine song. Vic has a terrific voice. Fans of Vic Dana will like this the most.
41,1,Not your jagged little pill
42,5,He was the greatest. So nice to be able to still hear him play
43,5,"Excellent CD. Definitely recommend it. The case was a little cracked, but the disc was fine"
44,5,Another GREAT rock album by Axel Rudi Pell
45,5,Love Todd's new album! Saw him in concert and had to get the cd.
46,5,"I've had this twice on cassette, and both wore out, and twice on CD, I sold the first CD because I needed money, couldn't find a copy of it for a long time, then it appeared on Amazon.com and I snatched it up. This album reminds me of high school days, which I'm not too fond of, but the music I remember is very sentimental for me. The album tracks do not disappoint, some say the album is about homosexuality, but I disagree, the album can be about anything you perceive it to be - if a half full glass can be associated with optimism, and a half empty glass can be associated with pessimism, it's fair to say an empty glass can be associated with whatever."
47,5,I heard Take Me to Church on the radio and was immediately hooked. I researched the group online and learned they had this CD out. I love all the songs on it.
48,5,"Will You Love Me Tomorrow was released in 1960 by The Shirelles and charted #1 pop. The flip was Boys, a song so good The Beatles later covered it. Fans of The Shirelles, and girl groups will like this the most."
49,5,Many happy memories of this family going back many years.Their music has always been an inspiration to myself and to an untold numbers of others...
50,5,Purchased this CD after having read numerous articles on Gary Moore. He was a talented guitarist and singer and I am very happy with the CD.
51,5,"This is the real sound track from the movies, not the pop production by Hugo Montenegro.  Buy both."
52,4,Truly enjoyed it. Appears to be combined with some hard rock and jazz.
53,5,This Cd has alot to offer and the production is great.His bass playing is outstanding . Crystal clear bass playing. . Well mixed!
54,5,I can't beleive that it was cheaper to buy the CD that came with a free download than to just buy the download. Crazy!
55,4,An up and comer this artist.
56,5,I had this album in college and was delighted to find it again as a CD.
57,5,This kind of music isn't being produced .  Enjoy it !
58,5,The best TSOW album! EVER!
59,5,jospeh lullaby
60,5,"Awesome samples online already, going to be a must have for any collector for his or BTNH albums."
61,2,"It was ok bet it was a copy of the CD not the real CD its self. Because I have Volume 1 & 2 and the one  I received was nothing like 1 & 2 i was very disappointed in AMAZON saying it was an original one.<br />Tim Riggs<br />St.Louis, Missouri"
62,5,"This cd was a surprise to me and I listen to this cd a very lot, the different Opus on this side are a different kind of love of Milt Jackson, and it is hard to pick good individual songs. So Buy it and tell me What I know already."
63,5,"This album was written to be heard in one fell swoop. It sent chills down my spine several times, it's just plain amazing."
64,5,great
65,5,"I have been possessed by black metal music since before the beginning.  Volahn offers a native theme that is every bit as deep, dark, and cold as any other, yet unique in that B.T.C. fashion!  Being a Southern California native and a lover of dark music makes it impossible for me to not be totally enthralled by Volahn's sound."
66,3,the mix is OK its other than that great extras and a solid album.
67,5,Perfect. As described. Thank you.
68,3,Not a good as some of their others but OK.
69,5,"Fantastic overview of Vee-Jay Records' hits and some misses.  All of the familiar stars are here:  Jimmy Reed, Betty Everett, Jerry Butler, and some wonderful obscurities.  Well worth the price.  The oversize booklet is a gem as well.  If you love 1960s soul and r&b, this collection is a must."
70,4,"GOOD TUNES TO FILL IN YOUR BLANK IN THE SOULFUL COLLECTION SECTION!!...TKS CHARLIE R., LAS VEGAS, NV.."
71,5,"This is a good sounding, heavy, double sided 33 1/3 LP.  It is not a double LP set.  I thought it was a double disc when I  purchased it from a retail outlet.  Nonetheless, the cuts are sufficiently long.  Most of the content is from Scanners, with an extended suite track representing The Brood.  My disc has a greyish cast with some green mixed in around the center.  It is a high quality, collector grade pressing.  I paid $40.  Recommended."
72,5,Very well priced. Nice boxed collection.
73,5,"Love this man's music--and he's gorgeous, too!"
74,5,This is a excellent cd.
75,5,What a great voice and choice of songs. I love 'em all.
76,5,Great cd !
77,5,Magnificent voice & stellar performance!
78,4,Nice to hear some of the songs from the past. Thank you
79,5,Great Bluegrass.
80,4,The Prince Consort Chorus and Orchestra is to be commended for presenting us with a rare Sullivan Operetta not penned by the inestimable Gilbert.  Although Sydney Grundy claimed to have tried his best to avoid sounding like Gilbert he certainly stimulated Sullivan to come up with music that sounds like it belongs with the Savoy Operettas.  I enjoyed this work more than I expected to despite a few slight ensemble slips now and again.  A complete libretto is included within a generous booklet that tells us about the background of the work.  Spoken dialog is printed but not performed.  Haddon Hall was produced at the Savoy by D'Oyly Carte near the end of the reign of G&S. It is distinctly Sullivan in character so we need to salute Grundy for bringing out the kind of music we have learned to like from Sullivan.
81,5,Absolutely love this music and the selections on this CD - southern gospel music at its best!
82,4,enjoy their riffs
83,5,"It was what I expected. A great album and the # 1 hit for that month for 1976, If you leave me now. And I didn't --38 years later."
84,5,I love it it was in great shape when I got it was awesome
85,5,My Dad loves it
86,5,good
87,5,Great Albun  All tunes are catchey.  Super sounding.  Awesome.
88,5,I am very pleased.
89,5,"great music, good price, fast shipping, everything you could want"
90,5,very good!
91,1,"Great album. However, this pressing of the CD only plays on some devices. Plays fine in my DVD player. Does not play on my PC. Does not rip via iTunes. Does not rip via Windows Media Player 11."
92,5,Great!
93,4,"For being a cassette, sound is good. It's clear and plays great. Seems like it was well taken care of too. Great purchase!"
94,5,Gift.
95,5,Found a song I had been looking for for quite a while
96,5,awesome as promised and fast.
97,5,very good
98,5,Great album. Power ballads are a different touch for Blackie Lawless.
99,4,Great cd but shipping came later then promised only by one day so not a big deal but overall wonderful cd I love it and this was a great purchase
100,5,"Mostly a collection of previous works, but its Tomita, so why complain."
101,2,bought it for one song
102,5,"Superb, and so classic that I don't need to review it further."
103,5,Great resources
104,5,"Some of Jimmy's best stuff here, and the DVD is great!"
105,5,"This is a nice compilation of songs of the Willis Brothers. The group of the Brothers Guy, Vic & Skeeter Willis was already formed in 1932 and their first recording attemps were made in 1946 for the Sterling label, also the starting label for the famous Hank Williams Sr. They were backing him on his first recordings for this label). During 1947-1948 they were under contract of Mercury, followed by RCA Victor (1950-1952) and Corral  (1954).<br />Than followd by a rare recording session probably 1960/61 wich resulted in an album of historic songs under the name of the Smith Brothers and then finnaly arrived in 1960 by Starday. About 10 albums appeared on Starday and it's subsidiary label Nashville not included some rereleases on the Gusto, Hilltop label.<br />Already in 1987 an almost identic release of this cd appeared on Hollywood DCD-7809 so the new release shows a bloodless reproduction for what was already done (It's is the same company who sells the same stuff over and over again in differnt compilations howevers their are so much more songs left that needs to be released. !). This is for the ones who missed the frist cd a nice album with recordings taken from albums but also from various artists albums wich were not seen on their own albums. I have my doubts about two instrumentals on this cd &#34;High ballin'&#34; and 'Gear shiftin' that were probably tunes from the Tommy Hill Band but certainly not the Willis Brothers. However these tunes fit in this compilation of trucking songs.<br />Recommanded anyway. Soundqualitiy is typical Stary stereo but clean and well reproduced. Since I'm a diehard Willis Brothers fan this album is a welcome addition in the collection"
106,5,love it
107,5,Great tones
108,4,Decent cd.
109,5,"Very different from other Gov't Mule recordings.  I like it, but sample before you buy."
110,5,Luv IT!!
111,5,"Actually, I didn't buy this on Amazon, but I do own it!<br /><br />VIXX's Boys' Record is their special single albulm and it includes 4 tracks: 01. 이별공식 (Love Equation), 02. 차가운 밤에, 03. Memory, and 04. 이별공식(Inst). They're all very lovely to listen to and the CD design is really cool. It looks like a record, hence the album's name. The album comes with a beautiful photobook, a postcard-like photo, and a photocard. Both my photocard and postcard was Hongbin, so I'm very pleased :3"
112,5,"old , BUT Great"
113,3,I enjoyed it but not one of their better albums
114,4,I really  enjoying this CD
115,5,A tribute to Jack Jezzro and BeeGie Adair.  Thank you
116,3,"Good, but not spectacular."
117,5,Bought for my Father and he loves it
118,1,"WHY WOULD ANYONE BUY THIS CD, WHEN THE SONGS AREN'T EVEN LISTED?"
119,5,great cd
120,2,I was expecting a greater variety of genres and artists. Almost every song started with an organ intro. :-/
121,5,"If I had to pick one hip hop album to put in a time capsule, this would be it."
122,5,i loved the beats as well as the lyrics.
123,1,Very Disappointed ...not what I expected from Bob Dylan
124,4,Best Onyx Album
125,5,Love the album... Shipping was quick.  Packaging was great.  So many great songs.
126,5,"Hollie is truly an excellent artist, and although I wish it showed some of her other performances, these really reflect her amazing vocals."
127,1,thought this was going to be the whole music list..was only 5 songs. very disapointed.
128,5,"My copy was discovered at a local Goodwill and I was fortunate that the LP was in pristine condition. The music is like of the of the better JATP concerts - full of energy, superb musicianship and some great selections. And improvisation, of course.<br /><br />I would rate the sound quality as excellent (dependent upon the condition of the LP). There is a CD version of this concert floating around too. I have not actually heard a copy so cannot say if the mastering is as good as it is on this LP.<br /><br />At the time of this review there is no track list on this page. Here is what the LP contains:<br /><br />SIDE A<br />A1  After You've Gone...7:55<br />A2  Mitch's Lament...7:46<br />A3  Home Grown...5:52<br />SIDE B<br />B1  Mood Indigo...5:28<br />B2  Detour Ahead...6:22<br />B3  Fatty McSlatty...9:40<br />B4  Flintstones II...5:38<br /><br />In addition to some excellent music there is a bit of humor in the recordings as well. Specifically on Mitch's Lament and Detour Ahead Herb Ellis introduces the songs since he is the composer and mentions the ASCAP fees he expects from the live performance. Other tracks written by performers are Home Grown (Harry 'Sweets' Edison) and  Fatty McSlatty (Ray Brown).<br /><br />Performances are from the 1974 Concord Jazz Festival and feature the following line-up:  Sweets Edison on trumpet and Plas Johnson on tenor sax, backed by George Duke on piano, Herb Ellis on guitar, Ray Brown on bass and Jake Hanna on drums."
129,5,Halo collector
130,5,"Another stellar album from Brandi Carlile and company. It's great to hear them rock out on a few songs but still keep the great harmonies and beautiful melodies I've come to love. And of course, nobody can sing a song like Brandi."
131,5,High quality
132,5,excellent music love it
133,5,"A fun and uplifting album, each song is a little different but does not let you think I bough the album because of that one song kind of feeling that some people get."
134,5,"Virginia native Kenn Starr joined the collective Low Budget Crew in 2001. At the time, he was the only member of the Kev Brown and Oddissee fronted ensemble that wasn't from the Washington, D.C. area. Shortly after his induction in the crew, he released his debut single &#34;If&#34; and appeared on &#34;The Answer&#34;- an album track on The Foreign Exchange's 2004 debut &#34;Connected&#34;. His appearance landed him a deal with the indie upstart Halftooth Records and management by way of Hot 97 personality Peter Rosenberg. Arriving in 2006, his formal debut &#34;Starr Status&#34; boasted production from Kev Brown, Oddisee, Illmind, M-Phazes and Khrysis, among others. His subject matter ranged from battle rapper to all around everyman and even a person who wears his heart on his sleeve. Despite rave reviews and critical acclaim, the album barely made noise within the underground circuit. Not helping matters was Halftooth folding a mere three years after &#34;Starr Status&#34;. By the time the 2010's rolled around, virtually nothing was heard from him- that was until 2012, when Kenn revealed he signed a recording contract with the Arizona based hip hop label Mello Music Group. After his announcement, he seemed to disappear again.<br /><br />At the end of 2014, he resurfaced for the second time. The first thing he did was release a teaser trailer for his upcoming album that was ready to be released. The second thing he did was issue two promotional singles- &#34;The Movement&#34; and &#34;The Definition&#34;. At the end of January 2015, he released his second album after a long nine year hiatus- the appropriately titled &#34;Square One&#34;. On the production side, he works with familiar producers like Kev Brown (who handles the lion's share of the project) and Roddy Rod- however, this time around, he brings along the production of Black Milk for his album. Lyrically, he hasn't lost a step despite the extended length of absence. Starting from the brief title track &#34;Square One&#34; and the first single &#34;Say Goodbye&#34;, he airs out his grievances with the current state of hip hop. He teams with Sean Born again on &#34;Product Of The Basement&#34; and details the downside of friends with benefits on the Melanie Rutherford assisted &#34;The Definition&#34;. He recalls his path to maturity and adulthood on &#34;Strangers&#34; and trades verses with labelmate Boog Brown on the 14KT produced song about a relationship gone bad &#34;Exodus&#34;. He addresses his time away on the introspective &#34;Cigarettes & Whiskey&#34;, while collaborating with Supastiton and Wordsworth on &#34;Came To Deliver&#34;. Lastly, he creates a posse cut with Kaimbr, Hassan Mackey  and yU on &#34;Overdue&#34;. &#34;Square One&#34; is another great recording from Kenn Starr. While he hasn't really changed much of anything, he sticks to what he does best and in the end, it works out very well for him.e One&#34; and the first single &#34;Say Goodbye&#34;, he airs out his grievances with the current state of hip hop.

135,5,A great record to have for anyone who is a Sonny and Cher fan and a Cher fan must have.
136,5,"What can I say, Leela James is Leela James.  She has such a unique voice and is style is so unusual.  Awesome!"
137,5,Loved it. FYI-The video portions are kind of hidden on the disc. Also the video portions are just a photo slideshow of them making the new album. Its not a music video or footage of old Pink Floyd.
138,5,"oh my!!! he's back, mr do wah diddy diddy and sha la la himself, not to forget pretty flamingo and so many more. and its a soul, blues & jazz extravaganza with no less than texas guitar god jake andrews, joe bonamassa, eric clapton and former bee gees axeman vince melouney on 4 strings, tony marsico on bass, alvino bennett on drums and mike thompson and jools holland on keys plus little willie g!, gregg sutton, tom jr morgan and more.    deep deep soul: are you lonely for me baby, beggar for the blues  rockin' blues: lonely nights, remember me  poppin' jazz: don't go to strangers, straighten up & fly right  did i mention the mel & tim / johnnie taylor classic starting all over again featuring clapton smokin' the fret board loud & nasty  and more eg the temptations' classic soul to soul    Paul Jones is back!!! and produced again by Carla Olson."
139,5,I only buy CD's for bands I REALLY like.  The others I just purchase as MP3's.  This is one such artist that I really like/admire.
140,5,"The cd came in on time, the tracks here amazing, and completely worth the price. I love skillet and own all their cds, this one by far is my favorite with the hide range of songs it includes along with some extended versions of the songs. I also thing the packaging was appropriate. I admit it took a little longer than I thought it was for it to arrive, but still came around the date it said. I would definitely recommend it!"
141,1,I love the Beatles and after completing my CD collection decided to start my collection in vinyl. Even that the disc came sealed as new it had 2 tracks that were damaged. The red album had 1 damaged track.Vtrack.Very disappointed.
142,5,Expanded our children's connection around the globe.
143,5,love it a keeper!
144,5,These men are still amazing!
145,5,I really like this album.
146,5,Great
147,3,"Great voice but the material on this LP was a bit disappointing for me.  I heard Arnold at the Beacon in MA, with James Taylor several years ago.  He was amazing when James let me fly.  I also remember Arnold back in American Hot Wax.  Once again, a stand out vocal star.  I did not feel the material on this LP allowed the magic, that Arnold carries in his music skills.  Looking for another LP that displays this magic."
148,5,I am Beatlemaníaco and this item comes add much in my collection.<br />I am very pleased to have found this copy on vinyl.<br />Nestor Caiuby
149,5,Love his music
150,5,Cool
151,4,"Not as impressed with this CD as the past several, but still high-quality rock. Loved &#34;Words as Weapons&#34; and &#34;Same Damn Life.&#34; Definitely one of the best albums, but not as good as Disclaimer (I/II) & Karma and Effect."
152,5,"One of my favorite gospel CDs.  The last one got damaged, so I had to rebuy it!"
153,5,Great CD.  Would recommend it to anyone
154,5,"In my opinion, Scorpions have made 5 great studio albums. Chronologically, this is the third great album and this is the first that made headway in the States. This is actually a diverse hard rock album for its time and everything works. The aggressive tracks on this release are top notch and while they would write songs in this vein on future releases, none of them would possess the thunder or the delivery of &#34;Can't Get Enough&#34; and &#34;Another Peace of Meat&#34;. In fact, the latter track has arguably their heaviest riff period and they have a LOT of heavy riffs. The mid-tempo instrumental &#34;Coast to Coast&#34; is a killer and the guitar work is sick while &#34;Always Somewhere&#34; is a fantastic and very underrrated ballad. &#34;Is There Anybody There?&#34; actually has a cool reggae beat in its verses and the band pull it off well while still sounding like themselves.  &#34;Loving You Sunday Morning&#34; and the driving title track are also fantastic songs. Finally, &#34;Holiday&#34; is a gentle acoustic ballad that briefly becomes a loud anthem before returning to its quieter proceedings. All told, a great album by a talented band whose work has come a bit underrated over the years. Highly recommended.<br /><br />IMO, the five great Scorpions studio albums: In Trance, Virgin Killer, Lovedrive, Blackout, and Love at First Sting."
155,5,From a more innocence period of time inspite of the racism in the adult world !!!!
156,5,Nice clean sound. Rock 'N' roll as it should be.
157,5,Great
158,5,lemmy need i say anymore
159,5,Super album!!
160,5,"Alpha and Omega(reviewed together)<br /><br />2014's Clear was an experiment - which worked really well in my opinion - that was, in essence, a precursor to the kind of collaborative effort that would characterize Periphery's songwriting going forward. As interesting as that experiment was, it pales in comparison to the beast that is Juggernaut. Spanning 2 CDs and 80 some minutes in duration - the complexity of Periphery notwithstanding - this takes a while to absorb ... and appreciate for what it represents. It's obvious this recording was a huge undertaking so a few words to describe what is going on are going to be inadequate to say the least. That said, at least from a musical standpoint, this is fantastic. Everything fans love about this band is present in abundance and taken to the extreme, yet refined into a more cohesive listening experience. And this is an enthralling listen without a doubt. Thanks to bassist Nolly Getgood - who engineered this monster - the drums, guitars and vocals sound amazing. Don't believe me - listen to this with a good pair of headphones. Some of Misha's processing is present but takes a much smaller role compared to P-2. There are bridging moments (like at the end of \\""MK Ultra\\"") but nowhere to the degree we had on P-2 where it created a somewhat disjointed feel to the whole album. For fans of melody, there is much more of it, especially on the Alpha portion of the project where Spencer Sotelo really shines in my opinion. These songs were clearly crafted with him in mind, which is mind-boggling considering this band has 3 very talented guitarists.<br /><br />Some have questioned the simultaneous release of this in two parts. While I think it would have worked as a single double CD release with bonus DVD, I am okay with this as a double release with separate packaging, although I think the listening experience is clearly best by listening to the CDs in sequence. And for those that don't know, Alpha comes with a lyric book, poster and sticker with the cover artwork for Alpha. Omega is released with lyric book, a sticker of the cover for Omega and the DVD discussed below. Both discs contain the Sumerian Records sticker as well. The packaging and artwork is first rate and the lyrics clearly printed (and legible!).<br /><br />Musically, most reading this are familiar with the highly rhythmic, technical progressive metal Periphery put forth so I'm not going to elaborate much more than to say it's all here - the brilliant and insane rhythms of Matt Halpern, the tight, distorted and sometimes djent guitars, the interspersed keys and programming loops and the diverse melodic and screaming vocals of Spencer Sotelo. To keep it as simple as possible, Alpha is more melodic and tells the first half of the story and Omega is more aggressive, vocally harsh and tells the second half of the story. Alpha is the seductive slippery slope and Omega is Hell.<br /><br />And speaking of lyrics, Juggernaut is dark and not for the faint of heart. If you are looking for something akin to a horror flick then that descriptive might scratch the surface ... beyond that pure speculation. This one is best left to the listener to interpret/decipher. At times the lyrics seem a bit incongruent with what's going on musically - these brutal themes juxtaposed to more melodic passages - but for the majority of these songs the two are well matched. The band hasn't released a full interpretation of the lyrics at this time.<br /><br />The DVD that accompanies Omega includes the Juggerdoc (about 45 minutes) - which nicely explores the approach to the studio set up and recording process - and some bonus content (about 20 minutes) where Nolly interviews each of the band members (post recording process), asking each one about their take on the recording and their individual contributions to Juggernaut. Often informative, and certainly comical, both segments give viewers insight into the character and qualities of the players. One of the most interesting points Misha makes during his segment is that Juggernaut was a truly collaborative effort and that this really comes out in the music as well. The other observation is that these guys are basically crazy (in a good way)!<br /><br />With Juggernaut Periphery has landed. Not only have they crafted some great concepts and music, but more importantly, they've settled confidently into their groove and in doing so stamped their brand of metal on the world. Take it or leave it, these guys are the real deal - a massive, irresistible force.t interesting points Misha makes during his segment is that Juggernaut was a truly collaborative effort and that this really comes out in the music as well.

162,5,Thanks...great CD in great condition!
163,5,"This is happy music from Sweden.  The ensemble of musicians is wonderful and the songs are unique and lovely..  This is the second time I have bought this recording, as it disappeared from my studio, and we can't live without it.<br />Arunima Orr<br />Nashville, TN"
164,5,"ZAKK AND BLS, GREAT ALBUM."
165,5,"The songs on this album are most beautiful, touching and healing.  The beauty and simplicity are very comforting and uplifting, especially at the end of a trying day."
166,5,Excellent combination and wonderful renditions!!
167,5,he never disappoints-love his guitar-soothing voice
168,5,"This very serene, orchestral music was purchased to help a friend."
169,2,"This album decidedly better than The King is Dead.  It's lyrics are decidedly more purposeful than the shallow if listenable last album.  But the depth and poetry that made The Decemberists great is gone, perhaps for good.  The first song on this album, The Singer Addresses His Audience, is basically an apology for selling out.  I don't think they've sold out.  Meloy and co. put out 5 incredible albums before the inspiration failed him. He's writing the songs, at this point, that he can.  No one can go indefinitely.<br /><br />It's worth a listen, but keep in mind, this album is a dirge for what might have been."
170,5,nice
171,5,Excellent
172,5,"I am a huge fan of this CD. For many of us, relaxation means laying in bed with your smart phone or computer at the end of a stressful day. There are many factors that affects people included too many responsibilities, financial troubles, work problems, personal health problems and health problems in the family. We are so busy that we never take time for 'us' and 'relax'. We are constantly taking care of family and not ourselves.<br /><br />What I've learned is, i can't not give my best to anyone including my family if I don't start with myself. I try to make time for myself.  For me, relaxation is laying down with the outside world tuned out including my TV, it means listening to relaxing music like the 'Live Well' CD as well as my other musical collections by Jeff Gold Music.<br /><br />This CD is so calming, soothing, and relaxing. Janet Montgomery's soothing voice is gently supported by a light musical background. It will go along well with practicing relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, rhythmic exercise, and yoga.<br /><br />I will recommend this CD to anyone experiencing stress or insomnia, anxiety, depression or pain.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for an unbiased review. Opinion stated are 100% mine."
173,1,Really disappointed. Received the record only to find that the whole A side was scratched up upon opening it. Very upsetting since it was a Christmas gift for someone.
174,5,"Wonderful artistry, vocals and music. MTV and Venegas do a great job, even when I usually prefer the studio recordings. I can listen to this album over and over again."
175,5,I love this on as much as the first album I bought.  I can't get enough of his voice and his story.
176,5,"Here's one that seems to have slipped by the tired eyes of over-stimulated music lovers. Four bona-fide STEVIE WONDER Seventies masterpieces lumped together in a glossy hard card outer box - each in an oversized gatefold card sleeve with individual booklets (&#34;Songs In The Key Of Life&#34; is split across two card sleeves hence the total of five spines).<br /><br />It's hardly original I know and there's no new remastering in this 2011 reissue (they're the KEVIN REEVES remasters from 2000 repackaged) - but man what a listen. And if you don't own the 2000 remasters - the box is nicely presented and a truly stunning reminder as to why Stevie Wonder is so beloved. These albums are just unbelievably good. Here are the Inner Visions, Superstitions and Sir Dukes...<br /><br />Released June 2011 - &#34;Classic Album Collection (1972-1976)&#34; on Motown/Universal 0600753366226 (Barcode 600753366226) breaks down as follows:<br /><br />Disc 1 (43:30 minutes):<br />1.

Easy Goin' Evening (My Mama's Call)<br />Tracks 1 to 7 are Sides 3 and 4 of the double-album &#34;Songs In The Key Of Life&#34; - Tracks 8 to 11 are the 4-track EP that came with original copies of the vinyl 2LP set (has no booklet, 2000 remaster).<br /><br />I love the KEVIN REEVES remasters (done in 2000 at Universal using original tapes ) - warm and full of presence - bringing songs like &#34;You've Got It Bad Girl&#34;, &#34;He's Misstra Know-It-All&#34; and &#34;Isn't She Lovely&#34; to life. The only title I find slightly sonically disappointing is &#34;Songs In The Key Of Life&#34; which seems to lack real sparkle on some tracks (the way it was recorded?).<br /><br />For many Stevie's true musical journey begins with March 1972's &#34;Music Of My Mind&#34; and his new found Seventies sound and songwriting voice - so it's a shame it isn't here. But opening with the gorgeous &#34;You Are The Sunshine Of My Life&#34; works for me. You also forget how good tracks like the slow funk of &#34;Maybe Your Baby&#34; and the ballad &#34;You & I&#34; are - &#34;Tuesday Heartbreak&#34; the same. And who can resist the fabulous ARP boogie of &#34;Superstition&#34;.<br /><br />We then of course step up into unmitigated genius with &#34;Innervisions&#34; - second only to &#34;Songs&#34; as a fan fave. Listening again to the beautifully remastered &#34;Too High&#34;, &#34;Visions&#34; and &#34;Living For The City&#34; in a row is a thrill - even after 40 years. The album nuggets &#34;All In Love Is Fair&#34; and &#34;Jesus Children Of America&#34; still have that cool and warmth that amazes. It ends on the superb &#34;Don't You Worry `Bot A Thing&#34; which would surely have been another Top 5 hit.<br /><br />After the magnificence of &#34;Innervisions&#34; I can remember that &#34;Fulfillingness...&#34; felt like a bit of a disappointment - but again a rehear and a reappraisal are in order. &#34;Too Shay To Say&#34; is as lovely a tune as he's ever penned and the double-whammy of &#34;Boogie On Reggae Woman&#34; and &#34;You Haven't Done Nuthin'&#34; (with The Jackson 5) are funky moog workouts that still thrill. The Latin-scat of &#34;Bird Of Beauty&#34; is cool too as is the slink of &#34;Creepin'&#34; (great vocal work from Minner Riperton) and the Smokey Robinson vibe to the finisher &#34;Please Don't Go&#34;.<br /><br />What can you say about &#34;Songs In The Key Of Life&#34; - it feels like &#34;Blonde On Blonde&#34;, &#34;The Beatles&#34;, &#34;Exile On Main St.&#34; and &#34;Physical Graffiti&#34; - a double album you'll never tire off and can dip into for years to come and still seemingly find something new.

177,5,thanks
178,5,A-OK !!!!
179,5,This CD is a must have as you really get a good collection of SeaSick Steves work!  You can't go wrong far as I'm concerened<br />to add this Cd to complement the other SeaSick Steve's work! Great Artist! Love his work! A++++
180,5,Like this better than Cannibals for sure but just a different taste of Richie with Cannibals. Love the Winery Dogs as well.<br />Cheers Richie
181,4,is nice but I don't like so much
182,5,Brilliant Thanks
183,4,A great CD!
184,5,Excellent book! for my daughter's college
185,4,Good to do massage or yoga to.  Nice if you wanted to just relax.
186,5,"beautiful heart breaking but never winy or despairing, a classic."
187,5,I haven't heard this album since the early 90's.  Way too long to not appreciate good music.  Not like the garbage of today.
188,5,"I was never really interested in this particular genre of music until I saw Hugh Laurie perform on The Tonight Show.  I know that this isn't what purists would listen to, but it has introduced me to the works of Kansas Joe McCoy, etc. and it has been a delight to learn more about these artists and their music."
189,2,Vinyl sleeve came bent and wrinkled. That's really stupid.
190,5,Awesome!
191,5,great cd
192,5,You can't go wrong even though they aren't remastered for all 5 of these classic Trower albums.  The price is right and it still sounds better than the records do.
193,2,nice
194,5,"Five BRILLIANT Stars! The award-winning violin and piano virtuoso Julia Fischer's latest Decca release is a wonderful combination of Max Bruch's Violin Concerto No. 1 in G minor, Opus 26 and Antonín Dvořák's Violin Concerto in A minor, Opus 53 (B 108). With excellent support from the Zurich Tonhalle Orchestra under the baton of maestro David Zinman, the violinist and orchestra are in superb form producing exceptional versions of this well-matched program of Romantic violin concerto works, both of whom were influenced by the input of violin virtuoso/composer Joseph Joachim. Fischer's inspired, fiery bow work produces a lyrical performance of Dvořák's awesome but under-appreciated 1883 concerto. This should elevate the popularity of that work immensely among violinists and classical fans, especially the spirited Allegro ma non troppo movement, with it's hauntingly beautiful themes, which proceeds seamlessly into the grand second movement. The more popular Bruch concerto is played with sheer brilliance by Fischer and the orchestra, especially the soaring Finale (allegro energico) movement, with its swirling 'Hungarian style' influences. This is a marvelous addition to the Julia Fischer discography linking the brilliance of these two celebrated Romantic composers and is further evidence of her place among the finest classical violinists. Bravo, Julia, David, and the ZTO! My Highest Recommendation. (Reviewed in MP3 format. 6 tracks: Time: 56:20.)"
195,1,oops
196,5,"I am enjoying the CD, I would recommend it."
197,5,Putumayo is consistently excellent. This CD is no exception.
198,4,"She sounds great, very healthy voice. However, not a lot of creativity on the pieces and composed as the standards, but slower paced. I think that I expected more artistic impression and have been left feeling like &#34;that was a good cd, because I love her voice&#34; versus &#34;that was a great cd, she is baaaaack!&#34;"
199,1,Too many repeated sound track.
200,4,The only issue I have is &#34;The COMPLETE Albums Collection&#34; How is this complete? Can anyone answer this? Hahahaha
201,5,"This is the best gospel recording ever!  Every cut is amazing. I am trying to find a CD of it, but no luck so far.  We have vinyl and tape.  Was it ever made into a CD?"
202,5,Enya is haunting music and good to the ears.  As a listener I enjoy the tracks on this CD.  Buy it and you will like it!
203,3,not too happy with her choice of songs
204,5,"Wow, I really love the remaster job on this recording. The packaging is wonderful, much thought went into this release. The listener is the<br />real winner here. I do not recall ever purchasing a re-release done so well. &#34;The Wander&#34; was Donna first record with Geffen, and i really like it very much, and so glad to have back in my collection. The record starts with &#34;The Wander&#34; excellent song and, moves this listener just like it once did.<br />&#34;Cold Love&#34; is another standout here. Summer takes the fan in another direction, and exceeds at her talents. I have always enjoyed &#34;Who Do You Think You're Foolin&#34; Donna changes the directions a bit with this song, and takes the listener on a wonderful journey.<br />I would encourage all Donna Summer fans to purchase this beautiful record. It is exceeding all my expectations."
205,5,"I have several recent (last 10 years or so) recordings of the \\""Impressions...\\"" and two violin sonatas that are on these CDs, all played very well by Romanian musicians. But it seems to me that Sherban Lupu's performances are the best performances that I have heard of these works. The engineering and sound is excellent, but above all Lupu's perfomances of them excel. But an even better reason for buying this is for the \\""Caprice Roumain.\\"" As someone who buys every CD of Enescu's music--and listens to them repeatedly since with every listen you hear more from and understand more of his compositions--the Caprice is an unknown treasure to me. I first read about its existence in the notes for \\""The Unknown Enescu, Volume 1\\"" CD issued by Toccata. I tracked down this recording, bought it, and recommend that it join that list of works that are \\""finished\\"" by other composer--but \\""finished\\"" well. Especially if you bought \\""The Unknown Enescu,\\"" or collect Enescu or are interested in Romanian music, this CD should join your collection. Sherban Lupu excels."
206,5,YEah...sing on!
207,5,"Love the movie, love the music! I can't get enough of Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler's singing!"
208,5,"Great musical sixties produced lots of great singer works sadly faded from memory, &#34;I've Gotta Be Me...this trip out&#34; by Della Reese is a prime example, signed to ABC Paramount the legendary ICON recorded a number of incredible Lp's that have sadly never seen light of day in this anemic digital age. Brilliantly arranged by masters, the phenomenal lady of song can really sing a storm, peak form throughout this timeless incredibly amazing album,  classic session would be a great one to remaster, receiving proper release on Compact Disc would serve current bankrupt music world with a musical feast to savor and enjoy forever, Please!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
209,5,Recieved CD in excellent condition.  Great '80s music!
210,5,This was a gift for my mother and she loves it. Has been listen to it every day when she takes her walk and enjoys it a lot.
211,5,nice
212,5,thanks for the gift!  Happy Holidays!!!
213,5,"How can anyone say there is a &#34;best&#34; Church CD?  Of his four, and I play them to the point of annoying my family, this one gets played most.  I'm not a big fan of the &#34;new&#34; country, I grew up on classic rock, southern rock, and country classics like waylon, Willie, hank Jr., David Allen Coe.  Church IMO is cut from that cloth and this album kicks butt!"
214,5,So much as I listen to every Trey Songz album one of them become better from before.
215,5,Bloc Party + Deep house= Trick by Kele. One of my favorite artists of all time.
216,5,LOVE IT

218,5,Very good - we have really been enjoying it
219,4,This is for a Christmas gift.
220,1,scratched
221,2,Couldn't really get into this one.Not even close to &#34;Offering&#34;
222,5,Great music. Really enjoying the cd.
223,5,"I probably first heard AC/DC in 1976 when a friend played TNT in his basement but I really didn't get into AC/DC until I heard Sin City a year and a half later and I have been hooked for the last 36 years. I absolutely love the Bon Scott years but I also also love the Brian Johnson years and this is this best Brian has sounded since Back in Black and For Those About To Rock. I've bought everything else since and saw them in Cincinnati for the Rock and Roll Train Tour and even though I was happy with that CD, I still went back to my older stuff when I I wanted to listen to Angus and the boys. That will change with this new offering which I have listened to three times today. It really rocks and I'm thrilled for the band even though I'm disappointed with the Phil Rudd issue and depressed over Malcolm's situation. I could go on and on singing the praises of AC/DC but I know all of you already know what I know and love them like I do. Now let's Play Ball!!"
224,5,"One of my favorite jazz records in the last 10 years. I keep looking for something else by him but find nothing. Seeing nobody has reviewed this I will offer this short summary: Big band orchestration that has at times harkens back to the days when jazz was king, but there a modern  progressive feel floating around underneath. I like jazz I can dance and hum to, but I like it when it goes wild at times or just calms down in a beautiful melody. All instrumental this record delivers just what I want at times."
225,5,"The relatively poor audio quality of my LP version of this concert hides the magic that this CD brings to life. As an audiophile I can attest to the great sound quality of this CD. Hot August Night (1972) has always been my Diamond concert gold standard. In fact, this CD may change that perspective. Neil has further crafted his art in this 1977 concert and this CD wondrous. A absolute must in any Neil Diamond collection."
226,5,Contemporary and examplery of the great composer of catholic music.
227,4,Music in modern and musicians are professional and very good
228,5,perfect
229,5,I am very happy with the product and quick delivery.  Thank you.
230,5,"Nice CD, good addition to your holiday music."
231,5,"LOVE this cd! Even my grown kids that don't really like \\""Christian\\"" music like it. They all have a copy. Jars of Clay is an amazingly talented group. In this cd, they have taken old, well known hymns and made them a little more contemporary. Normally I do NOT like that, but this was very tastefully done. Beautiful music, great vocals."
232,4,"This is an interesting album of piano solos.  The first four tracks are all wonderful, among the best piano solo music I've ever heard, while the fifth (and last) track is very forgettable.  I'm awarding this one 4 stars as an average of the five tracks, but the first four have made this album a very welcome one in my collection.  Note:  I have one other excellent album by this performer/composer, one which is titled PIANO COMPOSITIONS BY THEA, but have not been able to find it listed on Amazon.  If you like this album I think you would enjoy that one as well.  Thank you."
233,4,My daughters and I love this cd!
234,5,Excellent!
235,5,"great cd with new lead singer, though no mention of GOD or jesus, great doing business"
236,4,"I've really enjoyed this record.Very talented musician,nice songs,jazzy oriented.Such a pleasure to listen to it and...such a surprise!!"
237,5,A wonderful selection of traditional seasonal songs that are beautifully performed. A truly masterful work of art.
238,4,sound quality needs improving
239,4,Excellent laid-back California blues compilation by a Master at the peak of his powers. J. J. Cale will be sorely missed.
240,5,"The absolute best,!"
241,5,Just Beautiful.  The first song would be a lovely wedding song.  The last song is my favorite!  I Could Have Danced All Night!!!!<br />  Still love the J&C combo the best.
242,2,"Just ok. Nicky Hopkins was one of the great session piano players ever and can be heard at his best with the Stones and some earlier dates with JGB. This was his last show as he was battling severe chrohns disease and heavily medicating with drugs and alcohol and was let go as he was a mess. Get \\""Let it Rock\\"" instead, Nicky is in much better shape and Ron Tutt is a monster on the drums. This has a few high points but you can tell the night was nothing special and nothing really gelled to create anything exceptional."
243,5,"Having has the US version of &#34;Vows&#34; with the Target bonus tracks, and noticing that the Australian Tour Edition had some addictional cuts not on the US version, I ordered this one too...played it and to my surprise, it was so radically different, every song!!  It's like she redid the whole album for the US market!!  Why did she do it??  Was something wrong with the Australian mixes or something??<br /><br />It's fun to compare the 2 versions though...as for the missing cuts, &#34;Withdraw&#34;, the studio &#34;Golden Ring&#34;, &#34;Limbo&#34;, &#34;Wandering Limbs&#34;, and &#34;Call Me&#34;...all but &#34;Withdraw&#34; were also redone...&#34;Limbo&#34; was on the US &#34;Settle Down&#34; EP, &#34;Wandering Limbs&#34; a Target bonus track, and both &#34;Golden Ring&#34; and &#34;Call Me&#34; as iTunes bonus cuts...<br /><br />There's also a cool remix EP on iTunes...<br /><br />But yeah, totally redone...not sure if anyone noticed but it's fun to compare...and it looks like the 2nd album, the amazing &#34;Golden Echo&#34; is the same album, it's just there are 3 bonus tracks on the Australian deluxe and iTunes bonus tracks...<br /><br />But anyway, this woman is a genius..."
244,5,just what I ordered  songs I wanted
245,5,i like this cd
246,5,ALL PERFECT
247,5,Great CD. Paul has a gorgeous voice. Love all his CD's
248,5,Great cd for fans of traditional country
249,5,greatest band
250,4,"DK3 doesn't live up to Danity Kane's sophomore project &#34;Welcome to the Dollhouse&#34;. In my opinion, that was their best album as far as production, vocals, and just an overall diverse album that perfectly blended R&B/Pop. However, one thing that this album has a lot of that the previous two records did not have is Shannon Bex. Shannon was the member in Danity Kane who had the least vocal leads. She was dubbed the quiet one, because she was out shined a lot of the time by the other more popular members. However, this album is a showcase of the undeniable talent that was hidden during the early DK years. Shannon delivers on every record with this crisp clear voice with this underlining swag that strikes you as genreless. Shannon sounds amazing on the DK3 album, and in combination with Dawn's spectacular tone that will always be a staple in the DK sound, creates this sidebar sound that allows you to almost disassociate the trio version of DK from the quintet version. The stereotype produced songs seem to balance well with Aubrey’s breathy vocals, but her voice does not shine on the project as much as the other members of the group, and from time to time falls flat. Ultimately, it's a great appreciated effort for a farewell to fans. With that being said, I think Danity Kane fans will still leave missing something…"
251,5,Great sound! The music is A+. The words are exactly what I need to hear.
252,5,Everything was perfect!
253,3,decidedly country.
254,5,"This is a great combinations of voices and song selections, as only Barbra can combine!  Her voice is still amazing!"
255,5,One of the best CD's The Cult ever made...A must have
256,5,Excellent !
257,5,Hot tunes from Trini 2014
258,5,Absolutely beautiful.
259,5,This man's music needs no support. I just wish I was wealthy enough to see him live.
260,4,I received the item in very good condition and plays very good too.
261,3,"Below his best, three Road CDs make listening frustrating loading each individually for short set on each."
262,5,this was a requested gift idea.
263,5,Hard to find but got it here for the low low!!!!!
264,3,So So
265,5,love her music
266,4,"So why would anyone buy a live, mono recording of a 1960 performance when we are blessed with so many great recordings with superior sonics? You must first, admittedly, be tolerant of historic sound which is subject to distortion when the ensemble or high, loud notes overload the microphone and you must endure both some radio interference and the prompter's starring role, but if you are of that stripe then you will find a rich reward here, starting with six of the finest voices ever to undertake the principal roles. They are complemented by excellent playing from La Scala orchestra under a great Wagnerian conductor in Andr&eacute; Cluytens, not usually associated with Wagner but evidently sympathetic to his idiom, as his \\""Lohengrin\\"" at Bayreuth, also with Sandor Konya the previous year, confirms. You have only to listen to the orchestral introduction to Act 3 to realise that he knows exactly what to do with this wonderful music. His pacing is just right and the whole opera, with just three small cuts in Gurnemanz's narratives (two in Act 1, one in Act 3) comes in at a sensible timing of 3 and 3/4 hours, excluding applause and announcements. Andromeda provide absolutely no timings for tracks, individual CDs or total duration, just some nice photographs and the track cues; it's all very minimal so you'll need a libretto.<br /><br />However, in addition to the superb conducting, the cast is stellar, as good as any other set I know. Boris Christoff is as fine as my favourite Gurnemanz Kurt Moll, his gravely beautiful voice being perfectly suited to conferring interest upon monologues that become tedious when sung by a less gifted and charismatic singer. He sings in good German; ten years earlier you would have heard him at La Scala singing an already mature Gurnemanz in Italian opposite the young Callas in an excellent, if heavily cut, version also featuring some other very fine singers, but obviously by 1960 the tide had turned and Wagner was being performed in Italy in the original language and almost complete.<br /><br />Likewise, Sandor Konya's Parsifal is near ideal; he has just the right heroic weight, unflagging stamina and youthful tenderness of voice to impersonate the Pure Fool. Rita Gorr's big, brazen mezzo is similarly ideal for Kundry and she negotiates the roles challenges with ease, including the terrific nine-note interval on \\""lachte\\"", perfectly suggesting Kundry's desperate world-weariness. Gustav Neidlinger's lean, incisive bass-baritone depicts Amfortas's agony vividly and we have a real bonus in Montserrat Caballe's First Flower Maiden, as sweet and enticing as Gundula Janowitz for Knappertsbusch. The sixth singer is the big surprise to me: I had never heard of Georg Stern but he proves to be quite the best Klingsor I have heard on disc, hard, biting and venomous.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this performance once I had inured myself to its sonic limitations; it is Wagner performed just as it should be - would we could field such a cast today.language and almost complete.

267,5,Amazing!  Love it!
268,5,Great
269,5,Excellent!!!
270,5,Excellent! Fantastic!
271,4,A good CD for Clay...
272,5,Just as advertised
273,5,I really miss her and enjoy her CD's.
274,5,"This is a great live performance CD. My father, drummer Bill Reichenbach, formerly with the Charlie Byrd Trio (Jazz Samba, etc.) worked with Teddy Wilson often on the East Coast. Such a wonderful surprise to have this recording surface after all these years."
275,5,ok
276,5,Loved the album.  Love her!
277,5,Awesome music.  Good subdued sound
278,5,great cd
279,5,"More Schipa, beautiful voice and thanks for your prompt deliveries."
280,5,Love the CD. Bettye has one of the most beautiful voices I ever heard and I love the type of songs she sings.
281,1,"When I saw all the 4-star and 3-star reviews, I couldn't wait to order this CD. I was a Harry Nilsson fan and loved his original songs and his renditions of them. But this album was a total letdown. The orchestration is rich, textured and beautiful. Almost every song has a long, gorgeous introduction that makes you feel like you are sitting in the center of The Philharmonic Symphony. Then this thin, quirky voice sings each line of every song flatly, with no emotion,  without one extra note or trill and not one word punched or emphasized. It's as though Harry &#34;phoned in&#34; his portion of the album with a cigarette hanging out of the corner of his mouth. Most of the time he is drowned out by the orchestra. Although his quirky voice did great justice to his original songs, in this album he sounded like a rank amateur at best. I regretted spending money on this album and, more importantly, taking up space on my Ipod. I'm removing this album from my Ipod. Trust me, he is no Michael Buble in any sense of the word. I am totally baffled by the reviews that gave this album ratings that are much higher than it deserves."
282,5,Very good various christians rock.
283,2,The LP is great. The CD is awful. Who mastered this thing??
284,5,This was a gift for my mom and it arrived without any damage
285,5,A classic.
286,3,"Mark:-6,5"
287,5,"Excellent album.  One of the band's best, as long as you do not get the &#34;remastered&#34; version."
288,5,A great sampling from the Ken Burns &#34;Jazz&#34; documentary.  Makes you want to hear more.
289,5,Very spiritual.
290,5,Definitely on my all time favorites list.  Ladies that don't even dance will wiggle to some of these songs.  And everybody knows you can never get enough lady wiggle.
291,5,"First time I have ever bought one of their CD's. I was not disappointed. They have a great beat, and are a little different than other groups. I like the group and highly recommend the Cd."
292,5,Awesomly inspiring.
293,5,Fabulous! Bloodstone is R&B.
294,4,"...with a big side of groovy, funky jazz.  Some up tempo, some cool and mellow.  Lots of great instrumentals mixed in.  These Aussies got soul!  If you're a fan of the Hammond B-3, you can't go wrong with this one.  It's so satisfying."
295,5,"as described,fast shipping"
296,5,A+
297,1,"This CD corrupted both my Bose stereo players! Now, not only does it skip or not play at all, but other CDs have issues, too."
298,5,This album is not intended for faint of heart and is intended to be played in high volume! you have been warned....
299,5,Must have for EWF fans!!!
300,5,I love Voa GREAT cd.
301,5,"Nice CD.  I purchased it because it was the &#34;clean version,&#34; without all of the profane lyrics."
302,5,The cd arrived. Thanks.
303,2,"It's ok, just not my favorite."
304,5,great amount of well played and sung music is included on these cds.  have some other classical music in this series and believe the sheer numbers of cds and hours of music acquired are well worth the relatively low cost of the sets.  the set has a good variety of music and you can probably play these cds on a vacation trip without hearing the same cd twice.  if you enjoy this genre of music this is a worthwhile investment.
305,5,still dancing
306,5,Star Lord's Awesome Mix Vol. 1 is what this CD consists of and is in fact awesome!
307,4,A blast  from the music past.  Enjoying it!
308,4,Happy with purchase.
309,5,AAAAAAAAAA++++++++
310,5,good music
311,5,This was all I had hoped for and more.  I was a true Graham Central Station fan and now to have all of their music together in one location is exciting.  I have been playing the CDs almost every day since I got the CD set.  An excellent purchase.
312,5,liked the soundtrack
313,4,"Pretty good album, lots of filler though."
314,5,"What can you say? It's Peter Noone ('Herman&#34; of the Hermits) rockin' and boppin' his way through all their bouncy, breezy hits. They are all here, every one of 'em. Sure, The Hermits were the jokers in the deck of the British Invasion, but they played that part better than it's ever been done before or since. This is ultimate Feel Good Music -- just take it for what it is and enjoy the endorphins it induces. Plus, it's a near-perfect job of transferring the original recordings to digital. Almost impossible to tell the difference between this and the vinyl. All you CD producers take note: Hire the person who did this transfer for your next project (and then listen to his recommendations, please).<br /><br />As Peter sang... &#34;I like it... I like it...&#34; :)"
315,5,"Super fast shipping.  Good music, no scratches.  Very satisfied."
316,1,"Annoying voices, some shrill-like to my ears and some couldn't carry a tune. Chants were sung waaaaay too fast to be at all calming or ritual feeling. Was this recorded in someone's living room? I forced myself to listen to the whole CD in hopes of finding one redeeming song/chant, but nope! Chants to me must be calming to some degree and these were anything but. A pure waste of money and not adequately represented as the amateur product it, quite obviously, is. If they had included words I could have at least put my own spin on the chants... as it is I won't listen to it again to write down the words. Very, very disappointed."
317,1,the movie was ok. the dvd  had scratches and couldn't be watched in its entirety
318,5,Excellent
319,5,I f-ing adore P!nk.
320,5,Momma is a Beatles fan.
321,5,"I did not know what to expect from this cd, however, after listening to it I am pleased with it. It reminds me of the songs my mother and elders sang when I was young. I love this piece."
322,5,"George Perle’s music never dilly-dallies. It doesn’t beat around the bush; it goes straight to the point. Wit and vivacity are the hallmarks of his language, leavened with lyricism and invective. Fluid, pliant—and occasionally acerbic—his music communicates with clarity and purpose.<br /><br />Pianist Michael Brown plays Perle’s music with conviction and a distinctive flair. With his infallible command of the instrument, he has a way of unearthing new depths of artistic meaning.<br /><br />The recorded sound would have benefited from greater crispness and less echo."
323,4,"I was looking for a record which included my favorite Whittaker , namely &#34;THE FIRST HELLO, THE LAST GOODBYE&#34;. It does not appear to be on any of the available CDs. Anyone know where I can find it?"
324,5,Some kind of excellent vibrations
325,5,"They just don't come any Cooler then Nils......sorry,but they don't"
326,5,Had things that I was not expecting.
327,5,"Great CD, received as described by seller. Would recommend to anyone."
328,4,NZ Punk I would recomend this to my Friends. The Plauge was one of my Favorite Songs.
329,5,Another great album from Brad Paisley. You need this album in your collection. Get it / enjoy it.
330,5,Iz is 1 of my favs!
331,5,Shipped quickly and is of good quality.
332,5,"Great CD, great band"
333,5,Met my expectations in every way
334,5,great johnny winter was a great guitar player. vince.
335,5,This sounds like classic JP in the 21st century. I also like the longer and moodier songs like Lochness.
336,4,"After such a long time without anything new from TFF, I was so excite I bought a record player just so I could get this.  After all that, I hate to give it anything less than five stars, but honestly it's not their best work, but it's still good.  Overall, I'd say it sounds like a return to the 80's as opposed to their last album, Everybody Loves a happy ending.  My Girls is a decent song, which is an achievement considering it was almost unlistenable when preformed by it's original band.  Ready to Start sounds like a throw away track from the 80's; it's not very good.  The stand out song is the last one, And I Was a Boy From School.  Overall, I'm glad I bought it.  The music is decent, and it is a novel collectors item."
337,4,Great!
338,5,love love love this. I had unfortunately forgotten and left my Dixie Chicks CD's in a car I traded in and<br />of course they were gone when I went back. I replaced them as soon as I could!
339,5,I have always enjoyed this release on tape and now I have on cd. Any Ray Stevens fan will love it.
340,5,Absolutely love it. Probably their best live show ever. Very good quality recording as well. A must own if you like Nirvana. Way better than the Muddy Banks.
341,5,Thank you.
342,5,What can I say?  Never want to be without a fresh copy of this classic!
343,5,A must have for WA fans
344,5,One of the best albums ever produced. I never get tired of listening to it. Especially remastered this good.
345,5,Totally.
346,5,Great album.
347,4,One of the Best of Elvis Costello's imo.
348,1,"Incredibly disappointed by this album. Was in love with the song &#34;Reverse&#34; after hearing it on Alt-Nation, but that is the only track on this CD that's any good."
349,4,"I ordered both k& M versions of MAMA. The items are sealed, and the design is great and interesting. But, the K version's cover has little bit been broken. And the M's version's sticker is very dirty. T.T but, overall the whole package is still good. I got both group pictures from K & M."
350,5,"For Scrapbook Gal & others who are initially shocked by this LP's apparent oddness...<br />Artists change. Those that are creative need to move to new levels.<br />Times were chaingin' and so were The Beach Boys.<br />Yes, the record company wanted more million-sellers like Barbara Ann, but those that are creative want to push things to new heights, like Brian Wilson did with Pet Sounds and Good Vibrations.<br /><br />I wasn't around when The Beach Boys were in their prime, was born a year before they hit it big.<br />The first time I ever heard the songs on this LP was in the 1990s.'<br />I expected more mid-60s greats like Calif. Girls, The Little Girl I Once Knew, I Get Around, Wouldn't It Be Nice, etc., and soon realized that like Pet Sounds, Smiley Smile is an acquired taste.<br />It requires several listens.<br /><br />Aside from the hits, the great run of songs on Side 2, With Me Tonight, Wind Chimes, Gettin' Hungry (which was a Hot 100 hit single), Wonderful and Whistle In are intriguing songs, ones I listen to often.<br />I include these songs, as well as some from the following LP, Wild Honey ( the title track, Aren't You Glad, Country Air, A Thing Or Two, Let The Wind Blow) in my comp. listing of all Beach Boys hits plus significant LP tracks.<br /><br />Please, give Smiley Smile another listen. Eventually, you may come to love it, as many others."
351,4,"Richard Marx is a musical genius, so very talented. This CD is a big change for him, and you have to listen to it a few times before it really settles in. He is writing and singing from a &#34;single again&#34; perspective, and his lyrics reflect a guy who wants, as Marvin Gaye said, to get it on!<br />With that in mind, some of the lyrics are a bit much and too repetitive, lots of talk about hands, sweat, bed, inside...but the fact is what really sets the mood are the melodies behind the words. They are lovely, soft, sultry, sexy...very beachy. Richard said he finds the melodies first, and then fills in the words. You can tell that is true with this outing, as the music is stronger than the words. The only song that sounds as expected from Richard is Turn off the Night, which really seems to be the actual &#34;beautiful goodbye&#34; song to his wife on this CD-and it is beautiful indeed. I would also suggest his other CD, My Own Best Enemy, which is excellent, and seems to have more notes. This CD is very good, but it is intended to be one note: mood music."
352,4,"I have the original recordings from the 1980s in storage.  The recordings are all I remembered.  Good fun, if the old songs are somewhat inaccurate (as, for example, a crocodile in the bay in Hawaii)."
353,5,So many great hits on here.
354,5,My 2 year old loves this soundtrack which has been played daily since it was delivered.
355,5,Met Jester in 1975 and sang with him in a workshop.  So happy to have this recording.
356,5,"This is a terrific album, one of my favorites, (and I don't particularly like country!)<br />Many of the songs are true &#34;rockabilly&#34; and there are also a couple of beautiful ballads.<br />The mix of songs flows perfectly on the whole track.<br />k.d. lang has such an incredible voice, and these songs showcase her amazing talent.<br />This album ALWAYS makes me happy when I listen to it, which is very frequently.<br />I recommend this album VERY highly!"
357,5,A winner
358,5,great cd.
359,4,Great recording.  So glad I have it.
360,5,Excellent!
361,5,How can anyone not like this music.  It is so uplifting and cheerful.  It just isn't long enough.
362,5,I highly recommend this product.  Zro never fails his audience. I like the beats as well and the great balance of bass. Good job Zro.
363,5,This is a very nice collection of well performed and best known music from Mozart's opera.  The voices are excellent.
364,3,I wasn't too impressed with this set.  My favorite song was &#34;Midnight Shadows&#34; with Mary O'Reilly.  I like that song so much it was worth the set.  Tubular Bells is good too.
365,3,"I was hoping for a more exciting release here, but Rod and Gaby have back slid a bit here and there really isn't much new or inventive going on.  The disk is quite short at just about 30 minutes.  I'd leave it alone."
366,5,"It is amazing how relevant Savoy Brown (or shall I say Kim Simmonds?) still sounds.<br /><br />For a band that started at 1965, this is no small feat!"
367,5,"Here's the short of it:  This album flat-out rocks your *%$ off and there isn't a single bad track on it.  Dark, heavy, powerful, foreboding, irreverent, and fantastic...<br /><br />Here's the not-so-short of it:  If you're reading this you probably already love Sabbath, and for all the reasons many of us do, but on the off chance you're new to Black Sabbath I'll quickly lay out why so many of us--although we may endlessly argue about Ozzy vs. Dio or which of the albums we think trumps the rest--why we consider them the final word when it comes to real-deal metal.<br /><br />Black Sabbath has something important to say, and they say it powerfully.  Listen to War Pigs and you'll instantly figure out why Sabbath is still relevant.  It's not faked; they're not trying to be something they're not.  They're not \\""trying\\"" to be heavy or dark, it just is.  The subjects and themes they talk about are a very real and important part of the human condition.  They're not up there playing to get laid, or even make money (okay, so those were always probably really nice fringe benefits *lol*)...they're making important statements in a very real and dramatic way.  In a philosophical sense, there's a lot of truth in what Sabbath does.  And because they're not \\""trying\\"" to be something or anything, the music can speak for itself.  It comes across as visceral and real.  Like I said, dark, powerful, foreboding, completely irreverent, and totally anti-bullsh#t.<br /><br />So why did I choose to review Dehumanizer rather than other more well-known albums?  Well, for one thing, Dehumanizer is woefully underrated.  [[ASIN:B001EOOQEM Heaven & Hell]] and [[ASIN:B000002KHH Paranoid]] are beyond famous (and for good reason), but Dehumanizer just doesn't get the respect it deserves. Most people, even some Sabbath fans, don't even know this album exists, and if they do have never really heard it.  Every person I've turned on to Dehumanizer says basically the same thing:  \\""Holy $^%&!!!\\""<br /><br />Unlike some others I'm not really passionate about which particular Sabbath album is the \\""best\\"", at least not enough to argue about it.  I have my favorites of course, and Dehumanizer is definitely one of them.  I find myself listening to this album as much or more than any other Sabbath album (which is saying a lot).<br /><br />Ronnie's voice is, as usual, perfect.  IMO his is the hands-down best rock/metal voice ever.  And yes, Ozzy is great too in his own way, but in terms of shear vocal quality and ability there is no comparison. Dio is a singer; Ozzy, well, isn't.  Listening to RJD sing \\""I\\"" is just mind-blowing...truly a vocal master.<br /><br />Tony Iommi is known as the Godfather of metal for a reason, and he does justice to the title.  The riffs are pure and driving (you can't NOT bang your head) and his leads are blistering.  People acknowledge is unequaled ability to create a seemingly endless stream of awesome rhythms, but I don't think he gets enough credit for his leads.  He is one of the few guitar giants that have significantly improved in technical ability over the years.  And Dehumanizer certainly proves it.<br /><br />Geezer is, well, Geezer.  Without him, Sabbath wouldn't be Sabbath.  Geezer isn't some vague rumble underneath everything else; he drives the music, and gives it structure, depth, and direction.  Although syncing with Iommi perfectly, he has his own thing. If you've never really paid attention to bass guitar before, he'll make you.<br /><br />Vinny Appice's drums sound live and real. Very few drummers can truly carry the heaviness of Sabbath, and Vinny is one.<br /><br />//<br /><br />One final note: whether you're talking Ozzy or Dio, Black Sabbath is one of the only bands that have actually grown better with time.  They're new stuff sounds fresh, alive, and awesome. Do yourself a favor and check out these too:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0026S98TS The Devil You Know]]<br />[[ASIN:B00BTHWFBK 13 [Deluxe Edition]]]<br /><br />//<br /><br />Bottom line:  Get it.  Crank it.  And enjoy some natural adrenaline."
368,3,"sounds like typical 1st batch CD &#34;perfect sound forever&#34;--so dont expect audiophile quality here (and a shame, some of the songs deserve it)."
369,3,"I have more recordings by Herbert von Karajan than any other conductor in a large recording library, and<br />I have defended his great artistry for over 40 years.  Sadly it is impossible for me to register anything more than a sad sigh as to what might have been had this recording been better cast and the Maestro had not been in what I refer to gently as, the beginning of his anal years, which DID get worse from time to time as he became something of a recording engineer and stage director into the bargain.  Hubris.  Perhaps. But Nemesis left him alone because more often than not he demonstrated a wizardly genius on the podium.<br /><br />This Meistersinger is NOT one of his greatest moments.  Fault cannot be found with the Dresden Staatskapelle orchestra or Staatsoper chorus or the Leipzig Radio Chorus.  Neither is there any reason to quibble with EMI's engineering team, other than a little too much echo surrounding choral parts here and there which draws attention to the studio bound nature of the project.  Neither does Karajan fall below his very high standards in regards to orchestra balance, revelations of inner voices in score and pacing, though from time to time he falls into a bit of a trance, over-egging the 'spirituality' of his approach, which is more appropriate to Tristan und Isolde or Parsifal than to Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg.<br /><br />But the whole comes off as precious and over-produced.  There is no joy, at least no spontaneous joy that arose in THIS listener as it did frequently in Kubelik's magnificent live recording from Munich 3 years earlier.<br /><br />There is a great deal to enjoy in this EMI recording, including one great performance from Karl Ridderbusch as Veit Pogner, Eva's papa.  But you don't buy a recording of Meistersinger solely on the merits of who is singing Pogner.  Fortunately Theo Adam is also a very fine Hans Sachs, although I found him lacking any geniality one hears in the beautiful performance by Thomas Stewart for Kubelik or even that of James Morris for Levine.  Some people regard Adam as a gruff and wobbly beast of a bass-baritone, no finesse or artistry, or so it would seem from some of the vitriol leveled at him from other commentators.  This isn't fair to this fine singer who displays a fundamentally beautiful instrument here, if a little over-emphatic when a little simpatico might be more in order.<br /><br />Helen Donath in her prime was an exquisite soubrette, but she is does not possess the requisite vocal heft to carry the ecstatic moments as one wants.  She is certainly preferable to Jochum's ungainly Eva in Catarina Ligendza, a fine Isolde, Brünnhilde and Senta but decidedly NOT an Eva.  But neither does Donath achieve the dizzying heights of sublimity achieved by Kubelik's Gundula Janowitz.<br /><br />Geraint Evans was a great baritone, especially in Gilbert and Sullivan, which is more than a touch evident in his Pantomime like assumption of Sixtus Beckmesser.  This is a caricature Beckmesser, so common until more recent years when this complicated character has been performed in much more human creature than he is allowed here.  Evans is too much the Warner Brothers character to register much more than buffoonery. But he sings beautifully nonetheless.<br /><br />Peter Schreier is another great singer in this cast.  But he hams too much as David, the apprentice.  I would expect Adam's rough and ready Sachs to have cuffed this David up side the head on a regular basis for his impudence and presumptuousness.<br /><br />The one blot in this set is René Kollo's aspirate ridden Walther von Stolzing.  His voice was always pleasant, occasionally beautiful but his poor technical training shows here.  He improved with time, turning in, for instance, fine recordings of Siegfried for Janowski and Parsifal for Solti.  His Tannhäuser is also considered something of a classic, though I lay that at the feet of Solti's electrifying conducting more than Kollo's vocal skillsin that killer role, excellent as he is.  In this Meistersinger he is very musical, sings in tune and doesn't honk or bleat, but his rhythm is all over the place from time to time and the intrusive aspirates ruin the legato of almost every line he sings, unless he is singing loud then he is able to move from note to note without breaking up the line with a vocal 'bump'.<br /><br />The famous Quintet in Act 3 goes for little, though it is perfectly executed by the five soloists, and Karajan is not too In Control in this section, yet, it doesn't elevate the listener.  Listen to Kubelik and you will understand what I'm saying here.<br /><br />In fact, if you want to know what this sublime opera is all about buy the Kubelik, any label will do, though the Myto release which I bought when it was first released does not include ANYTHING like a libretto or even a plot synopsis.  Perhaps one of the other releases on other labels provides those things, which are certainly necessary in this sprawling human comedy.<br /><br />So, like Eugen Jochum's DG set from Berlin, this Karajan was a make-do for decades, until Sawallisch's on EMI in 1994 and Solti's Chicago version on Decca in 1995.  THEN the Kubelik was released from the Bavarian Radio archives and has set them all in the shade."
370,3,"I am a huge fan of Fleetwood Mac so maybe my expectations of them when they release an album is a bit too high. So to me their 2003 album \\""Say You Will\\"" is average at best. Especially compared to what they have produced in the past. It is a decent album with some decent songs to be sure but nothing that is to me outstanding. There are some good songs on here don't get me wrong. Both Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks are in their usual great form as song writers but not on the level of what they have produced in the past. Christine McVie is missing from this album and it is noticeable. You don't have her fine keyboard playing or singing or songwriting as part of this effort and that may be why I find this album average. Without her contribution on this album is what I think is lacking in sound and feel on \\""Say You Will\\"". Since 1975 when Lindsey and Stevie joined FM the collaboration between them and Christine is what would help produce the sound everyone would love. With one third of that element missing it showings in the production of this recording. Still if you are a fan of Fleetwood Mac this is an album you will want to add to your collection. Even an average album by Fleetwood Mac is still better then most of what you hear musically nowadays."
371,5,"for some reason im atrracted to the 60's music. janis , hendrix, anyone from woodstock, none of this modern crap!!! lol."
372,4,I wish it was the deluxe edition. I bought it thinking it was the deluxe version. Ended up being only the main release.
373,4,"Wonderful overview of her career and music. Disc 1 is the better of the two but both are superb. She blended so many styles (and so successfully) that influenced her as she grew up into a beautiful, unforgettable body of music she aptly called &#34;the dream of the heart and soul.&#34;"
374,4,"I like this album more than his solo debut titled 151a.<br /><br />K Ishibashi is as whimsical and seemingly improvisational with his lyrics as ever, and it pays off very well, especially in the song &#34;The Ballad of Mr. Steak&#34; when he sings &#34;I believe when a man's in love, he'll do anything he wants, he'll do anything that will come to his mind. And like that Mr. Steak was in love, every minute of his mind, he's steppin left and right cha-cha.&#34;<br /><br />My favorite track is the second of the album titled &#34;philosophize in it, chemicalize with it,&#34; which was originally a Japanese commercial jingle, but everyone loved it so much that K. was obliged to make a full song out of it,  and boy am I glad that happened."
375,4,Great combo of CD's I wished it came with Mp3 for Kindle cloud<br />Great price for 5 CD's  recomend to all Petty fans<br />p
376,4,"Better sound on these recordings than I heard before, some of the songs for the first time on CD too."
377,5,I listen to it over and over in my car! I just love it! A must have for your country CD collection!
378,4,"Shuvel is very similar to Limp Bizkit. The constant cussing and the screaming combine with rapping and the heavy guitar riffs and the turntable sound is pretty much Limp Bizkit. Limp Bizkit is way better , but Shuvel is pretty good. They only Released one album though. I thought why not! I am enjoying this cd, which is the main reason I listen to music. The songs are fun to listen to. As far as making any sense, they don't really. Shuvel is one of those bands that you just jam to when you are in a great mood. But I wouldn't recommend it if you only listen to music that has a serious meaning behind it. That being said, Shuvel is a decent band to listen to. The lead singer isn't the best rapper or singer, but the beats make up for it."
379,5,Good selection of Slade songs. They are one of best 70's band or Rock form UK. The booklet and inserts of the box set are very good.
380,3,The cd came with two CDs. But the second CD does not play. The first CD is fine. But I am unhappy that the second CD does not play
381,5,great variety of classic songs.  you can't go wrong with this compilation.  makes me happy every time I listen to it.  Will be my go-to summertime music
382,5,Very enjoyable listening. Definitely a good fit in my classical collection.  Would appreciate more selections from this artist.<br /><br />Thank-you very much!
383,5,"The Nile Project, conceived in California by Egyptian-born ethnomusicologist Mina Girigis and Ethiopian-American singer Meklit Hadero, is, like Yo-Yo Ma's Silk Road Project, an exchange and collaboration of musicians from various ethnic communities across many lands; here, from the 11 nations in which branches of the Nile River flow. The project has another California connection--ethnomusicologist and part-time Egyptian resident Miles Jay, who served as Music Director. The project includes some academic and policy discussions of the region, a recording of traditional music for the Smithsonian Institution, and this concert album and DVD. In January 2013, musicians from Uganda, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan, and Egypt (some in diaspora) spent 10 days in collaboration. Each musician brought two songs. Each morning, they taught one another their respective music, followed in the afternoon with performances of duos, trios, and quartets. On the 5th day, they performed for the entire ensemble. Then, in Aswan and Cairo, they presented their first concerts. The Nile Project is now on tour, including the United States. These 18 musicians, singing and playing various percussion, bass, masenkop [five-string pentatonic Sudanese lyre], violin, maskinko [an Ethiopian single-string bowed lute], saxophone, oud, modified Egyptian simsimiyya lyre (23 strings to accommodate Arabic maqam modes), adungu [Ugandan lyre], endingidi [single-string Ugandan fiddle], and amadluda [Ugandan xylophone], created exciting, bright, energetic music. Indeed, the polyrhythms of the Ugandan musicians were strange but inspirational for the northern members of the ensemble, but conversely when the Ugandan harpists re-tuned their instruments for Arabic maqams, they felt their instrument weirdly off-key. The Ethiopian minor key blues is easily recognizable as Egyptian rhythms, call-and-response. Some tracks seem traditional while other have contemporary approaches. For instance, the saxophone is much favored in Sudan and Ethiopia. Some tracks are ballads, others are dances. The Project recording thus is a world music fan's delight, an example of international collaboration in developing a new pan-Nile sound. 74 minutes.favored in Sudan and Ethiopia.

384,4,"A track on this CD was featured during a video presented during the Banff Mountain Film Festival World Tour. Song: &#34;Young Men Dead&#34;, the video: Salomon Free Ski TV: &#34;The Burn&#34;.  That inspired me to buy the complete CD.  I was not dissapointed.  The only drawback is that the music tends to sound somewhat repetative in tone.  This is not a bad thing, if you're like me, and really dig the sound.  There are dark undertones to a somewhat retro feel in the rock-steady rythms The Black Angels offer.  Vocals are minimal, but dreamlike and enhance the overall mood as properly-placed instruments."
385,5,"I loved the CD and quality was great, no problem with any of the songs played and packaging was good"
386,5,I love STP and this is a  great collection of their music. I also enjoy that this is a physical CD.
387,5,CSN reminds you of the crazy sixties. They blend so good together. graham nash has a very melodic voice that blends so well with the other guys
388,5,I love the new progressive touch. Coulda been mixed a little better but I think I kinda like it the way it is as is. I hated their drummer Carlos at first he was very slayer like. Nic was tech and catch and brutal. Carlos really stepped up .
389,3,"I love dark funeral (except the attera sanctus whatever album) and at first this album blew me away. Now how ever many years after it came out i can barely listen to it. What was once astounding is underwhelming. Its got alot of good songs/riffs and rythms, but lacks what dark funeral, secrets of the black arts, vobiscum satanas (their best) and angelus exuro pro eternus have that makes them keep the initial emotions there years later. Do NOT SPEND 50 ON THIS! YOU WILL REGRET SPENDING OVER 15 FOR IT TRUST ME! Every band has its hiccups. And dark funeral had a 3peat sorta. With teach children and attera being total crap and this barely keeping the flames burning."
390,3,Basically white noise to me. Helped me relax but not fall asleep or stay asleep. Maybe further usage will increase efficacy.
391,3,Great CD's if you like lots of bass.  The songs do not have much if any lyrics though.  So for me the bass is great but I like lyrics to sing along to.
392,5,This is seriously the sickest CD case I have ever seen. Very impressive but difficult to keep opening and closing frequently/fastly.
393,5,Best Album I've bought in a long time! Every true rock fan should own this cd. I truly Love it!
394,1,"I ordered this Cd for my son who loves the songs from Pandora, but when the CD came the CD inside the case was a kids bop country mix. I was very upset as we don't like kids bop cds very much. when I complained they refunded me and told me they didn't have the CD. I was more upset because I felt that they knew ahead of time they didn't have it because they put a country cd in as if it was an ok substitute. a bit annoying."
395,5,"What can you say?  It's George Harrison!  Considered among the best guitarist in history and my favorite of the&#34;Fab Four&#34;. A shame he was over shadowed by John and Paul for he could have had many more Beatle year songs. Well, you can either spend a fortune buying songs individually, buy the album Cloud Nine and Brainwashed or you can get this which has every great song on those albums plus a few more."
396,5,"Was looking just for the CD's which are no longer in production as this double album is a great comprehensive bunch of their songs throughout their career, much better than the current best of. Not only do you get 2 CDs worth of songs but also a DVD of some of their singles. Great value purchase just for how much you get. Excellent testament to a once great Australian band"
397,4,If you are a Eric Roberson fan and have bought all of his other CDs. This purchase is a waste. But if you just want to introduce Eric Roberson to someone new. It's not a bad buy. I was just so excited to see a title I never seen. So I bought it without reviewing it. Oh well my fault. But now I can still say I have everything that Eric Roberson has released.
398,2,Always a risk purchasing items blind.  I already had heard Scheherazade some time ago so knew what I was buying.<br />I found Rachmaninov a bit to heavy for my liking.  The book was great.<br /><br />Your service was excellent and I will continue to use your site for future purchases.<br /><br />Regards...........Jenny Harris
399,3,"This is the complete version of Felix Mendelssohn's Midsummer Night's Dream including the overture and 13 parts of the Incidental Music.  Additionally, excerpts from the text of the play are spoken IN GERMAN between parts.  As my college German is from 1972-1975, I understood almost nicht!  I skipped these tracks.  I just don't need a reminder of how long ago that was. Then I discovered that the text tracks also contained bits of music, so I began again and endured the reality of my age.  The recording was made in 1990 but sounds as though it was from a few years earlier -- clear but with too much bass (and I usually want MORE base).<br /><br />The interpretation seemed perfectly adequate, but does proceed at quite a clip.  The vocal parts were beautifully performed.  The orchestra was generally well recorded aside from the excessive bass in the Overture, particularly.  Maybe it's idealism about marriage, but I thought the Wedding March was the best part on the disc.  Don't get me wrong, this IS a beautiful performance, but doesn't match up as well to today's sonics as other recordings from the early 1990's.  I'll report on Previn's complete version soon.  It offers a better alternative for the complete version, although NOBODY beats Leinsdorf for sheer intensity and enchantment.<br /><br />For now, the Masur recording can only be recommended to those who must have everything including German text.  I'd wait.<br /><br />For the Incidental Music with some spoken parts and the songs all performed in English, you can't beat Leinsdorf and the BSO.  Despite its age, it is spectacular!  Leinsdorf's account is one you should buy today!!!"
400,4,"I got this for my mother in law and she likes it. I never knew that Della Reese was a singer, I always seen her as an actress."
401,5,"This album is just fantastic. In Bob Seger's raunchy voice beautiful to hear.  Tunes are: Hollywood Nights, Still The Same, Old Time Rock & Roll, Til It Shines, Feel Like A Number, Aint Got No Money, We've Got Tonight, Brave Strangers, The Famous Final Scene.<br />We've Got Tonight was the 'hit' here in New Zealand.  Got me listening to this man for the first time.  I ended up buying every record I could of his and was NEVER disappointed.  A part of music history!"
402,5,Awesome. Just enjoyed the entire album as I was cleaning and studying in the house. The seller was great and this is an honest opinion.
403,5,"I WAS SO ECCSTATIC TO FIND THIS CD---out of print and very rare! It's awesome and it completely reminds me of the movie!  It's a treasure, so I'm glad I found it!"
404,5,"Love this album!  Joe's voice is soothing with a hint of perfection! CD arrived new in just a couple days.  Case was cracked but easy replace, no damage to CD itself."
405,5,"Very interesting music. Good sound, not the spectacular kind, more in the &#34;natural&#34; way, no harshness at all ....<br />Highly recommended !!"
406,5,"This is a little-known band and I'm not sure if they're still together or not.  Their acoustic Irish folk music is relaxing but not boring, and works well both for close listening and background music.  Also there is a good mix of fast and slow songs on the album.  Only three of the songs have singing; two have a female vocalist and one has a male vocalist.  I don't even know who female vocalist is, but she has a very childlike and calming voice that is one of my favorites I've ever heard.  If you enjoy fiddles, guitars, flutes, and simple, homey music, get this album."
407,5,"OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This is a MUST HAVE for ALL gospel music lovers.  From start to finish....you will be encouraged, uplifted and downright moved to shout and dance.<br /><br />Kurt is truly blessed with many gifts and surrounded with great singers.  Get this for yourself and tell your friends... Mine plays 24/7 in my office...and I tell you it keeps me in a good place when I have to deal with so  many issues in what has been a very stressful job.<br /><br />Buy it...you will be glad you did.<br />Kathryn"
408,5,This should definitely win a Grammy  the best ever. Like someone said this is grown folks music. The kind where the singer really has talent. Waiting for the next one or better yet a concert
409,5,"The Mediterranean Sea defines a region. The surrounding sea coasts and ports communicated with each other in trade, in culture, in colonization. A similar climate, typically balmy, and a common feeling of the sea, with fishing and travels also bring focus. Renaud Garc&iacute;a-Fons, a 5-string acoustic bassist, himself has Spanish, French, and Italian roots. With a talented ensemble he presents a clockwise musical exploration of the Mediterranean perimeter beginning with southern Spain. Lyricism is his forte, and with various rhythms and moods, the ethnic distinctions are more suggestive and atmospheric than with traditional musical idioms. Often a dance emerges, but sad ballads also are encountered.<br /><br />An ancient Andalusian rhythm and Moorish percussion begins the journey, and we are introduced to the variety of instruments: accordion, baroque lute, flamenco guitar, the double-bass, frame drums (bendir, daf, and tar), cymbals, and udu clay pot bass percussion.  Later in other tracks are heard the octobass and alto flutes, theorbo bass lute, Persian tanbur long-neck lute, cajon, shakers zarb goblet drum, darbouka drum, rik small tambourine, clarinet, bansuri bamboo flute, bouzouki lute, and guimbarde Jew's mouth harp. Lorca's Spain next leads to a 12-beat flamenco seguriya as forceful military hymn. From Mars, we meet Venus in a song of love and inner beauty as a Renaissance lute ballad.  Remaining in Spain, the musicians go to festive, cosmopolitan Barcelona.  France is reached with the words of symbolist writer Auguste Villieres de l'Isle-Adam as oars.  Just past the Spanish border is Aregl&egrave;s-sur-Mer, site of a concentration camp; drone basses and the double bass bring a chilling lament in honor of the interned 100,000 Spanish Republicans. Italy and the wit of Federico Fellini change the mood with the track, La Strada. Rome is next with a playful folk tune that flows easily across to Greece, where the bouzouki and ping-ponging drums suggest a line dance.  The Dalmatian coast comes into view. The upper pitched riq tambourine and zarb drum announce another crossroad region, with European and Middle Eastern patterns merging. Next tracks honors the Mediterranean as the sea of myth, of the journey of Odysseus across the Aegean to hidden mythological islands. Turkey's Bosophorus, which separates the Mediterranean from the Black Sea, is marked by rhythmically and lyrically bowed basses, but we must turn south to Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley. The metallic strings of the tanbur and the pseudo kamenche-spiked fiddle by the bass indicate the Asian lands to the east. Suddenly we are in the middle of a joke with a humorous Middle Eastern ditty; Garc&iacute;a-Fons suggests that it is a tale from satirical Sufi Mollah Nasreddin. Another corner is turned and to the west lies the vast desert of the Sinai, played by a solo double bass. Quickly we are in Maghreb with a 10-beat Arabo-Andalusian dance. The journey ends in Ksar-es-Seghir, the Moroccan castle town at the Straits of Gibraltar.<br /><br />Once again Garc&iacute;a-Fons has produced a wonderful fusion of world music sounds and instruments entirely unique to his pen. Warning: listening to this album may induce wanderlust.almatian coast comes into view.

410,4,It was the thing they should never do and generally do anyway. A horrible hour long track separates the two sides of this classic double album. You almost do not make it to King Kong as the cd drones on. It was done when Frank was alive and I don't know his thoughts. Did he think it was a gift?
411,4,"Album Review | \\""Braveheart\\"" - Ashanti | 3.5/5<br /><br />It's been six years since Ashanti's last album and the singer has been hard at work crafting her latest release, \\""Braveheart.\\"" The project, which was 100% funded by Ashanti Douglas herself, was released on March 4, 2014. She also took on the role of CEO and produced the album as part of her own independent record label, Written Entertainment. According to Douglas, this era is about being brave and being more open with the public about her personal life. It's also about her indie record label (the Scotts) going up against the major record labels (the Brits) on the music charts and coming out on top, hence the title inspiration from the 1995 Mel Gibson film of the same name.<br /><br />After a multiple listens, I've concluded this: Overall, the album is a solid effort but there hasn't been much growth in the six years that have gone by; at least not in many of the records chosen for this cd. For me, \\""Braveheart\\"" is on par with her 2008 effort, \\""The Declaration.\\"" It's not bad. It's not great. It's just okay. The cd has a little bit of everything for everyone but because of this, it feels disjointed and incomplete. And once it starts to get good, it's over. There are, however, a few standout tracks:<br /><br />\\""Braveheart\\"" - Ashanti's voice soars with confidence and vigor on this L.T. Hutton produced opening track. This is a great mid-tempo power ballad that really shows that long gone are her days of simply cooing alongside rappers hardcore beats. She can handle tough beats on her own and this is definitely a smart way to open up the album.<br /><br />\\""Count\\"" - This is the most radio/club friendly track on the album. The song is in the same vein as Rihanna's \\""Birthday Cake\\"" but better. Here, the singer challenges so-called \\""ballers\\"" by asserting, \\""Don't make me count that money, if you're spending like you're saying then lay it out in front of me!\\"" Her swagger on this track is incredible and I can see this beinga big crossover hit with the right promotion.<br /><br />\\""Scars\\"" - Douglas is most vulnerable here and should be since the song is about her ten-year on-again, off-again relationship with rapper, Nelly. Here, she addresses his alleged infidelity and commitment issues. She goes from being angry and vindictive on the verses with lyrics like, \\""And I'ma make sure I'm drop dead gorgeous every time he sees me so he want it more\\"" to ultimately heartbroken on the bridge with confessions like, \\""Thought we were going to build, thought what we had was real, thought we were going to live in a house on the hills, maybe three or four kids, Bentley's and drop Benz's, we were supposed to ride out and be best friends.\\"" This is Ashanti at her best: raw, honest and relatable.<br /><br />\\""I Got It\\"" (Feat. Rick Ross) - The first \\""official\\"" single off of the album, this is a great comeback track produced once again by L.T. Hutton, her collaborator of choice. The beat is infectious and the lyrics are catchy. The video is just as praiseworthy but a lack of promotion and performances on TV coupled with a lack of radio play has snubbed it's success, which is truly a shame.<br /><br />So, if you're a dedicated fan of Douglas' past music or solid R&B in general, get the album. You won't be disappointed. However, if you, like me, were hoping for something a little more tenacious and poignant, skip buying the complete album and purchase the select tracks you enjoy the most. Ashanti claims to be more open on this cd, but truthfully, she still seems hesitant about wearing her heart on her sleeve. But then again, who wouldn't be?<br /><br />Extras:<br /><br />Let me end my review on a more personal note. I've been a fan of Ashanti since 2001. Everyone has that one or two artists they go crazy over as a teen and for me, Ashanti was the one. What drew me to Douglas vs. her peers like Beyoncé and Ciara was her realness and personality. Additionally, she writes all of her own music and unlike many ofher peers, covers a variety of subjects like love, domestic violence, death and poverty. Think about it, how foolish will Beyoncé look singing \\""Drunk In Love\\"" at age 50 unless it's a jazz cover? Exactly. However, there are three major issues that continue to set Ashanti back:<br /><br />1) Performance: This has been always been her weakest point. What irks me is this is an easy fix. She's talented but she needs to refine her skills through a vocal coach and a better choreographer (Brice Vick's choreography has been notoriously terrible). To her credit, she's grown on her own over time but she should be at the top of her game at this age and after officially being on the music scene for thirteen years.<br /><br />2) Management: Ashanti needs new management. Initially, her family did a great job supervising her career but now she is a \\""seasoned\\"" veteran and her fan base is waning. It's true there are a lot of sharks in the entertainment industry but there are still good companies out there doing right by their artists.<br /><br />3) Writing: I love and respect that Ashanti writes her own lyrical content and hence, gets a bigger percentage of the profits of her music than most artists. However, she needs to allow others to compose music for her and/or collaborate and co-write with her. Her styles of writing and content have become way too predictable over the years and a fresh pair of eyes or new way of approaching tracks would benefit her tremendously.<br /><br />I've always rooted for Ashanti. Maybe I like an underdog. But, if she constantly rejects a new way of thinking, her career will continue to free-fall. But who's to say she wants to be the princess of hip-hop and R&B anymore? Trying other entrepreneurial ventures (TV, Movies) and collecting her many royalty checks from writing hits for herself and others over the years is an excellent backup plan that I can respect. However, knowing music is her passion, becoming a contender once again will demand a major butvery feasible overhaul."
412,5,"This CD serves as a sampler for the Atlantic era of Chris Connor.  Excellent introduction to this phase of her recording career.<br />Thank you Amazon...I didn't have to order it from the UK!<br />From reading the liner notes, it looks like all of her albums are scheduled for re-release.  I've already ordered her first Atlantic which is called 'Chris Connor'.  I believe WB or Rhino is releasing them from the UK.  Sound is excellent.  Highly recommend this album."
413,5,Great cd. All the hits I love to hear and both cds have great quality.though out the cd. I higly recommend  this heat hits cd.
414,5,"sound quality is good, a nice selection highlighting their progressive style from that era. great speed runs from trey. I recommend this to anyone into music."
415,3,Was not what I expected and is average.  I must have misread the title tracks when first stumbled upon the CD.
416,5,I had this cd previously and was unable to find it. I replaced it at a great cost. I love this cd.
417,5,Walk about 4 miles a day and I listen to Mickey  on my MP3 player. Don't leave home without Mickey..
418,5,"I have all Bonnie Raitt music.worth the money spent,fast shipping fair price.this is one of my favorite cds that i have bought."
419,5,"Audra McDonald is a master of her craft. MARIE CHRISTINE put her on the map and every song in this show showcases that. Dramatic story, amazing storytelling and wonderful ensemble performances."
420,4,this is an incredible cd. I loved it<br />some of the songs are repetitious and sound nearly the same otherwise I woulda given it 5 stars.<br />I was very impressed with the guitar solos and 2 singers work well together. Killer cd. I loved it \m/
421,5,"This recording of Corelli's Opus 6 Concertos marks the beginning, not the end, of a long term recording cycle project where the Avison Ensemble will record all of Corelli's chamber pieces over the next few years. The effort started in 2013, and to date (early 2014), there are three releases in the set: this one, the [[ASIN:B009G7WUBU Corelli: Violin Sonatas, Op. 5]], and the [[ASIN:B009G7WV4G Corelli: Opus 2 & 4 - Chamber Sonatas]].<br /><br />If you've taken the time to read the reviews on these releases, or even of any of the Avison Ensemble's earlier recordings, you'll be sure to see the universal acclaim for both the performances and the technical recordings that are a part of all these releases. I have to say that, when I first purchased in 2012 the Avison's release of Handel's Concerto Grossi opus 6 recordings, I was simply amazed and astounded at both the performances and the recordings themselves. It was a bit of a shock, as I felt that nothing would ever be able to live up to the Pinnock's recordings ([[ASIN:B0000057CD Handel: Concerti Grossi, Op. 6, Nos. 1-4]], [[ASIN:B0000057CE Nos. 5-8]], [[ASIN:B0000057CF Nos. 9-12]]) of these with the English Chamber Orchestra (and which remain deep favorites of mine), but there could be no denying the power and impact of the Avison's release of these pieces, and the quality of the sound that burst from the discs was extraordinatry. Of course, that album went on to win the Grammophon Album of the Year award, and reviewers from around the world were as effussive in their own estimation of that release.<br /><br />It's with this background in mind so many people who had prior experience with the Avison Ensemble and Linn Records were so excited to hear of their new Corelli recording cycle project. And the excitement was found to be completely warranted: this first recording of Corelli's opus 6 Concerti Grossi is every bit as wonderful as the earlier works by the Ensemble. The performance is beautiful, nuanced, dramatic, lyrical. If you enjoy Baroque music, this is not a recording to miss. When one listens to these pieces, we immediately ask, Why are not these works in greater circulation? I don't know the answer to this, but I can say that this performance by the Avison Ensemble is going to greatly increase awareness of these gorgeous pieces.<br /><br />Without repeating myself too much, it can't be overstated enough that the recording prowess of Linn Records, the record company who has been recording, mixing, and mastering the Avison Ensemble's works, is achieving recordings that surely must be ranked at the pinnacle of the recording world, and that includes comparison with any of the major, more illustrious labels who have been recording classical music for nearly a century. These recordings are beautifully balanced, with a large sound stage, undetectable noise (essentially, no noise floor at all), with wide dynamic range that never sounds screechy or harsh. The sound is just lush. How they do it is anyone's guess (I'm not a recording expert), but just listening to these and comparing them with the best recording efforts shows the skill prowess of these recording experts. It's truly remarkable sound. (This disc plays on standard CD players, but is also encoded with SACD for even higher quality for those who own SACD players, and people may not be aware that the actual studio masters can be purchased from Linn for the ultimate sound experience.)<br /><br />These discs are not cheap. But they are completely worth their price. And to know that these purchases are helping keep the classical world alive, as well as supporting newer groups like the Avison Ensemble that are pushing the envelop farther than could have been imagined and introducing classical to a whole new world of listeners, makes the price seem less in comparison. This is an easy up five star recommendation. If you like Baroque, Corelli, or just lovely classical music, I can't recommend them more highly. If you haven't explored this orchestra or their recordings, you are in for a BIG treat.xplored this orchestra or their recordings, you are in for a BIG treat."
422,4,"Anyone who is a Country music fan, especially of those artists who held sway in the 1960s to 1980s, will know about Lynn Anderson. All she did, from late 1966 to early 1989, was put 60 singles onto the national Country charts (and also sold LPs in the millions), including 5 # 1 smashes, 18 into the Top 10 and 47 into the Top 40, while having 10 cross over to various levels of the Pop charts (not yet deemed good enough, by the way, to warrant induction into the Old Boy's Club, aka The Country Music Hall Of Fame). There are also quite a few quality CD compilations of her music available.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the same doesn't apply to her mother Liz Anderson (born Elizabeth Jane Haaby on March 13, 1930 in Roseau, Minnesota but raised in Grand Forks, North Dakota) who, from early 1966 to early 1973, registered 19 times on the Country charts, including two Top 10 and 8 Top 40s to go along with 9 RCA Victor/ Camden LPs who has virtually been ignored in that regard. Oh, there's a made-on-demand collection of 10 meagre sides from Studio 102 Essentials, but it has absolutely nothing to do with her original best.<br /><br />So the question is, will any of that material be gathered into a quality anthology of sorts? Judging by the way far too many Country artists of that era - save for the major stars - have been totally ignored since the advent of the CD in the early 1980s, I wouldn't suggest you hold your breath. That leaves her widely scattered and used 45-rpm discs and albums such as this - \\""Liz Anderson Sings Her Favorites\\"" (RCA Victor LPM/LSP-3908) which emerged in January 1968 and was her fifth for the label (her second was a shared album with Bobby Bare and Norma Jean titled The Game Of Triangles). The contents are: 1. Ode To Billie Joe; 2. I'd Be More Of A Woman; 3. Apartment # 9; 4. Dumb Blonde; 5. Lay Some Happiness On Me; 6. What Locks The Door?; 7. Thanks A Lot For Tryin' Anyway; 8. I Washed My Face In The Morning Dew; 9. Your Tender Loving Care; 10. Get While The Gettin's Good; 11. Somewhere Between; 12. Something Called Happiness.<br /><br />One of her 19 charted singles is represented in the album, that being the December 1967-January 1968 # 40 Thanks A Lot For Tryin' Anyway (RCA Victor 47-9378). Its B-side, Come Walk In My Shoes, was part of her fourth LP titled \\""Cookin' Up Hits.\\"" In the event you're interested, her other charted sides and their B-sides are listed in the Comments below.e The Gettin's Good; 11.

423,5,"I've always wanted to hear an album where Noel sings all of the songs.  In my opinion, he is unquestionably a better singer than Liam.  Noel also possesses the songwriting talent.  That songwriting talent really shines on this album and nearly every song is great.  This was certainly one of the best albums of the year and I can't understand the mediocre reviews that it'd gotten.  This is a truly underrated album."
424,3,"Bill is a journeyman tenor player. Buying his CD was as good a way as any to use up my Xmas gift certificate. The Cd is just straight ahead mainstream jazz. Nothing special, but good jazz."
425,5,"By all accounts, Kempe commanded respect and affection from his orchestras and that is confirmed by the special sense of joy emanating from the music-making here. Everything about is right; even the full, warm sound is spectacular for so old a recording (made in the grateful acoustic of the Kingsway Hall in 1966 and 1967). The odd minor blemish notwithstanding, the RPO sounds to be full of virtuosi, led of course by the mellowest of horn-playes, Alan Civil,who also contributes a lovely performance of the First Horn Concerto - an oddly old-fashioned-sounding piece by Strauss's progressive standards.<br /><br />There is beauty, balance, power and tension in this \\""Alpensinfonie\\""; it is not the sonic blockbuster you get from Shipway in Sao Paulo or Karajan but everything is so well gauged that both the lyrical and the epic qualities emerge at every turn. The only hint of excess is the amusing over-zealousness in the application of the cowbells."
426,5,"&#34;It's good to be raw,&#34; sings Run, and the metallic guitar powering &#34;Rock Box&#34; proved it. Run-D.M.C.'s debut ditches early rap's party rhymes to codify B-boy style and make history, from the way they dress to their hard beats to the everyday subject matter of &#34;It's Like That&#34;."
427,5,"Randy Travis is a singer I can listen to forever. Only problem I had with this collection was the way he connected with me on a rainy Saturday afternoon. Many of these songs lead to one &#34;digging up bones&#34;, and thinking about the past."
428,4,"If you liked the movie, there is no doubt you should own this soundtrack. Also, if you like the violin, you will really enjoy this."
429,4,I bought this for my dad as a gift. Have never listened to his music before so I can't review that.
430,5,"Love DM and will always be a DEVOTEE!  This keeps in line with the fabulous DM music, but even expands on what you may have thought DM music was in the past.  A must have for any DM fan or anyone who wants to expand their music collection.  The book is awesome too."
431,4,Kelly Clarkson has delivered an excellent stocking stuffer meant to taken out and played again and again.  It's bright and bouncy with great arrangements of the old and new. Clarkson's vocals are also top notch.
432,5,"Second Time Around is composed by Oliver Jones .<br />The soulful blues Piano.<br />Oliver Jones is a really under- rated Jazz Artist.<br />He help shaped the world of Jazz from'50,' 60<br />It's fabulous stuff that still sounds great today<br />add  this to your Collection."
433,5,I am a great Dolly Parton fan so of course I found this great.  I had a good selection of her songs.
434,5,"Unlike the current US Albums box set, this set actually uses the original Capitol mixes that were on those original albums. The packaging and artwork are first rate. These are the mixes many of us grew up with, and that was what I was after!"
435,5,"I only want to say that, as the first satellite broadcast, this was and still is a historic event and it's great to have this CD as documentation."
436,5,"If you've never heard this cd I don't know if you can fully understand it if you listen to it for the first time in 2014. I'm not a huge fan of any of their other releases, but Coup D'Tat is is my top ten of all-time. Super catchy, well crafted power punk/metal. Just phenomenal."
437,5,how long's it been since something just walked up and said hello this strongly. as if a long gone friend just popped up out of the nowhere and said hey hello how are you i'm great and its all wonderful here. i might have thought country music was vanished for all intents and purpose. but it's not. it's alive and thrashing. and so is this dang album. forty seven stars. best canoe ever!
438,5,"I love these guys!! They are SOO underrated.Their harmonies CANNOT be beat,love,love love Andy and David Williams!! Wish they would make another cd!!"
439,5,"They just do not make music like this today. Just 3 guys singing with their guitars, they sing in unison."
440,5,"Not a bad song on this album, awesome voice, great lyrics, he nails it with &#34;I Don't Like Half The Folks I Love&#34; !!!"
441,5,I love it.
442,5,ace of base was a great band they were like the abba of the 90's it's a bummer that they only released two albums before dropping off the radar

444,5,"Exactly what I'd expect from Hap Palmer. My nieces love it. Dancing with thinking involved,  just for their age group."
445,5,"We give this to all of our nieces/nephews for their first birthdays. Of the 6 families who have received it so far, 5 love it (and the other one doesn't count... they have horrible taste in everything and didn't give it a try)!<br /><br />One year old is a fun age to get them started on this. It appeals to them, but older kids love it, too. Plus, it's not irritating for parents, like most kid music.<br /><br />Our kids learned to LOVE letters from watching this. And since it comes with an audio CD, we can use it in the car if we need to calm our toddlers (and the older kids still love it).  We do Here Come the 123's for their 2nd birthday and that's fun too (actually, I like the music even more on that one).<br /><br />My sister-in-law said the DVD saved her on a 20 hour road trip with her 18 month old. It's saved us many times, too. Our kids are now 6, 4, and 1 year. We started it when the 6 year old was 1. They've all loved it!"
446,5,A great classic 80's R&B dance album that is great to listen to from start to finish. I highly suggest this album for any one interested.
447,2,"I'm struggling to write this, not only do I not typically write reviews on here, but because I have historically liked Mason Jennings' music so much.  This album really teeters between a 2 to 3 out of 5 for me.  I might need to listen to it more, and if I do give it a few more passes and change my mind, I will gladly come back here and update this.  My initial impression however is that this one was hard to get through.  The instrumentals, melodies and rhythms were largely good and what I would expect, but the lyrics on this album just really fell short for me.  Simply put, they felt kind of hokey and simple, and I didn't feel myself wanting to sing along.<br />The folk/indie music space has an incredible amount of competition for my listening pleasure right now, and this falls really short of what I have come to enjoy from Jennings."
448,4,"The Big D, as fans so affectionately call Deliverance, have finally delivered the long-awaited, much-anticipated new album &#34;Hear What I Say!&#34; The initial hype was the the album would feature members from the first album and was to be titled &#34;The Annals of Subterfuge&#34;. Instead, the line-up consists of founder, guitarist, and vocalist Jimmy Brown, longtime guitarist Michael Phillips, longtime bassist Manny Morales and drummer Jayson Sherlock, formerly of Mortification and Parameacium. According to Brown this will be the last album for Deliverance.<br /><br />&#34;Hear What I Say!&#34; has a little bit of everything pulling from the band's past. However the overall album might be a disappointment to anyone hoping for that reunion of the early Deliverance members, because this in not a straight-forward speed metal/thrash metal album like those early D albums. In fact, I'd say that &#34;Hear What I Say&#34; is a blending of &#34;Stay of Execution&#34;, &#34;Lean&#34; and the wonderfully progressive &#34;River Disturbance&#34; and fits neatly against their last album &#34;As Above, So Below&#34;. After a short opening, the albums first track is &#34;The Annals of Subterfuge&#34;. This song was leaked in demo form on the 2013 Thrashmageddon CD. The song fits in nicely with the thrashers on that platter, as the song is heavy, fast and recalls the faster material on &#34;Stay of Execution&#34;. Brown sings with a slight grit and a bit of snarl. Follow-up track &#34;Angst&#34; is another up-beat speed metal number. The song features a huge groove-based bridge in the middle of the song driven by a crunchy guitar tone and ending up with more stellar guitar-work from Phillips. The remainder of the album moves away from speed metal and becomes much more melodic and progressive. A song like &#34;Hope Lies Beyond&#34; definitely would have fit nicely on the more melodic &#34;River Disturbance&#34; album. Actually, the melodic &#34;Nude&#34; would also have fit on that album. &#34;Detox&#34; is a heavier groove based song while &#34;Passing&#34; are more straight-forward heavy metal songs. The band also pull off a smokin' cover of Iron Maiden's &#34;Where Eagles Dare&#34;. The album ends with an acoustic number titled &#34;A Perfect Sky&#34;, that is mostly just a guitar with Brown singing along. His vocals are solid throughout, staying mostly in the mid-range, Bowie-esque style and rarely in the rafters like some of the &#34;Weapons&#34; material.<br /><br />Deliverance's final album features some of their best drum-work to date and some fine shredding from Sir Phillips. Having Manny Morales return to the fold really works in the band's favor as well. Whereas the bass was nearly buried on many of the early D albums, his thumping bass lines can clearly be heard throughout this album. It's a shame that Deliverance are hanging it up but if you are going to go out, go out on a high note. &#34;Hear What I Say!&#34; is definitely a high note."
449,3,Crystal Gayle's popularity was fading when this was released.  Everybody's Reaching Out For Someone was released as a single and didn't become a hit.  And Never Ending Song Of Love was released as a single also and wasn't a hit.  It is in a different sytyle then what she usually recorded.  It has an accordian in it and has sort of cajun style  to it.  She was even reduced to singing it on The Super Dave Show.<br />There are two good songs on here that I think could have been hits.  I think she does the best versions that I have heard of Once In A Very Blue Moon.  Which has been recorded by Nanci Griffith and Dolly Parton among others.  And she hits Faithless Love out of the park.  All the rest of the cd is good with nothing else really standing out.
450,5,"it's Vince Guaraldi - what else is there to say????  he is such a talented writer and musician, and the Peanuts music is integral to growing up in the US.  wonderful!"
451,5,I love the great Christmas carols on this cd....just have a fire and listen to the soothing music  being played...Puts your mind at ease during a hectic time...makes you focus on the true meaning of the season
452,5,I love this album. It is so amazing to hear his voice and the music is great. If you haven't seen him live you should!
453,3,Not what I expced all the music sounds the same though there would be more verity and melody would not order again.
454,5,I love Darlene's heart and passion for God.  It resonates deeply through her music.  I listened to this album constantly as I went through surgery and chemotherapy. I considered In Jesus Name as my fight song.
455,5,I discovered ONE REPUBLIC on my pandora listening channel. I noticed I kept giving &#34;thumbs up&#34; to their songs. I first listened to their more recent 2013 album and found I didn't care too much for it. This album is fabulous! Sometimes a label can change an already amazing sound.
456,4,I am glad I bought this album. Love every song on the album. Good jams from a top grade band.
457,5,"Bill Kirchen is a virtuoso on the Telecaster guitar. He is truly the guitar player that everyone can recognize (Commander Cody - Hot Rod Lincoln), but nobody knows.  This collection of songs is another showcase of his amazing talent."
458,1,It's NOT MUD IN YOUR EYE.  NOW I have to send it back and get it replaced.  How much fun can I have!<br />Who ever thinks this is the right one needs to learn to read.
459,5,"I love all of India's music, but this album resonates on a totally different level with me.  It is wonderful from beginning to end and it offers a story shared by all and lessons learned along one's journey. Songversation is uplifting and  marvelous."

461,5,"Bought for my nephew who is named Michael, he loves it.  He keeps playing it over and over.  It wont be long and he'll be singing it."
462,4,This jazz CD is great music for jazz listener.<br /><br />I believe if love jazz this one is for you.<br /><br />You won't be disapoint.<br /> The down load of this CD was easy and fast.
463,5,"I used to listen to the &#34;Cut the Cake ' on my 8-track in my car . And when I briefly went to discos in the early 70's , this was my band . A few years back , I heard a song on the radio , and brought me back to those times. So I came to amazon looking for the &#34;best of&#34;, and this Cd had the best songs an price , so I bought it . Every 3 months or so I pop it in my Cd player an groove out to the songs that fueled my youth . If You concider buying one of AWB Cds , get this one , You wont be disappointed."
464,3,"nothing wrong with the product or its delivery. I ordered this in hope it would be like my one bamboo gamelan recording from Bali. However, the rest of Indonesia has a style for gamelan I am less interested in. Part of it is the primacy in this recording of the women's voices. The instruments take a back seat. Undoubtedly I am ignorant of the fine points of Indonesian singing, but it did not engage me."
465,4,I have several favorites on this CD. They did not disappoint on this one. Very cool songs that are relevant today but; the lyrics will make sense later with out a history lesson.
466,5,"Nineteen albums of some of the greatest sound ever laid down!  The sound is excellent and the music is to die for.  Brubeck fans, this is the one for You.  I simply cannot speak too highly of this set.  Some have criticized it for not having a large booklet with lots of pictures and interviews.  Who needs it?  The music speaks for itself. Don't miss."
467,5,"This album is a must have for any Sting fan!!! Looking forward to the Play adaption!  Just when you thought Sting couldn't best his already remarkable body of work.  This album does not disappoint!  Last Ship is my new favorite Sting album, in my opinion he's best!  Bravo!"
468,5,"Big fan of both Christmas and Michael Buble. So when you put the two together, you just have to love it !!!"
469,4,"Gin Wigmore's voice is ...unique. No, that's not it...when she sings she reminds me of someone else, but I cannot remember or even describe who it might be. At any rate, her voice is different from the &#34;typical&#34; female singing voice that too often blends into the background drone of life. Anyway, that being said, this album is solid! Perhaps with more listening I would raise the rating to a full Five Stars. This woman is talented and entertaining and a gem of a find!"
470,5,I love getting new music and Chris Cagle is a great addition to my Country cd collection.  Amazon always has the newest releases and at a great price.
471,5,An oldie but a goodie........he transforms with time!  This will not disappoint.  Great selection of incredible guitar led music.  Carlos rocks!
472,5,this is the most beautiful album.  It's very old.  I owned it on vinyl in 1965.  When I found it in New York the 30 y/o check out person said &#34;it's my favorite album&#34;.  this was a gift.. so hope it was received and enjoyed.
473,5,"As always it was awesome, we love Celtic Thunder and are never disappointed with any of their CDs or DVDs."
474,5,LOVE this.  Anyone who rides in my car always asks who it is because it has a familiar but unique quality to it.
475,5,Fun is a great name for this band.  I love this album.  All the songs are great; this is so much more than the ones you hear on the radio.
476,5,"I am a novice when it comes to writing a critique for an opera.  However, I found this rare opera wonderful.  Although I am not familiar with the singers which were very good and the recording was clear with no static.  Most people are familiar with Ponchielli's opera \\""La Gioconda\\"" which isn't performed very much these days.  However, \\""I Lituani\\"" is indeed rarely performed and premiered in Milan, Italy in 1874 with great success.  However, this opera was a great accomplishment despite its initial success, the work has not held the operatic stage; maybe because its subject matter is obscure and the libretto complex..  It was last performed in May, 1991.  If you are a collector of opera then I would recommend adding this recording to your collection.  If you enjoyed La Gioconda  then I know you will like this opera. NOTE:  This opera takes place in the late 14th Century and based on historical fact."
477,3,"After reading  reviews, thought it would be more psychedelic 70s sound. Not. Have listened to this 5+ times. Their other albums more interesting."
478,5,"Vickki Carr does a great job of mixing Spanish with American music.  Her voice is a gem. Even my wife ,who is picky, listens to this CD"
479,5,"I ordered as a gift, and he loved it. Anyone who is a fan of the band will be please."
480,5,"I don't understand why people keep comparing the Streisand of today with the the Streisand of the 1960&#34;s-yes her voice has changed to some degree, but In many ways she is a much better singer today. BACK TO BROOKLYN is a masterwork of a brilliant actress and a brilliant vocalist merging as one. Not since Judy Garland has a singer been able to communicate with an audience so completely . We should all count our blessings that we still have Barbra putting herself out there."
481,5,"Excellent album.  High-quality recordings, and Kelvin is a great musician.  I highly recommend this album.  I listen to it every week.  It's very relaxing.  One interesting thing though, it's a long album (which is great - more for your money) but, for some reason track #8. \\""Patience\\"" (the last track) has playback/freezing/pausing problems when played in a DVD or BluRay player that also plays CD's.  The \\""CD-only\\"" players will play this album perfectly on track #8 and all other tracks.  I have 2 of these CD's (the company sent me another one when I told them about this issue); both CD's do the exact same thing on track 8 when played in my DVD or BluRay players.  They both play perfectly in the CD-only players that I have...  I've never had this happen with any other CD before.  Canyon records thinks that it has something to do with it being such a long album."
482,5,"A brilliant show from a brilliant songwriter in his heyday-The best Neil Young live album, paired with the &#34;Live at Massey Hall&#34;."
483,5,"It would be difficult for me to give this song any less than 5 stars just for the fact that I loved KMax's voice.<br /><br />Unless you have a horrible voice and/or make horrible arrangements of these songs it is hard to mess them up.<br /><br />Kevin's smooth, clear voice with the amazing vibrato make this Christmas CD easy to enjoy, it was money well spent.<br /><br />It's hard to pick a favorite song..but O Holy Night is one of my favorite Christmas songs, and O Come, O Come Emmanuel is great as well. I like them although to be honest.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this to someone who is a fan of: dc Talk, Kevin Max, Audio Adrenaline, fans of singers with unique voices."
484,4,"I remember when this came out around 1980. I may have been in 10th grade. This was the record. At least my friend played it a lot at his house. I even saw them in concert on their Heaven and Hell tour. The music on here may possibly be better overall, but not to me. Whatever it was Ozzy brought to the band was gone. They are good here on Heaven and Hell, but not great. When you create epic, anything less just isn't good enough. And they couldn't ride on the coat-tails of the greatness they had before, with Ozzy gone. They had to create epic and astounding again, and unfortunately, they came up a bit short.<br /><br />It's interesting that the lyrics Ronnie James Dio wrote to the songs he's played on over the decades have remained somewhat similar. Maybe he really did help write most of the lyrics. Now we know how he got his gigs. And he's a good singer, too. Dio was one of the more respected heavy metal singers. He kept touring even when, as a solo artist, he was performing in small clubs. I suspect he liked his job. If you're a huge fan of Dio, there's a rich body of work to explore and enjoy.<br /><br />This is more music for adult heavy metal or hard rock fans, or for older or mature teenagers. It's not so gimmicky, other than their keeping the same band name. I'm not a post-Ozzy Black Sabbath expert but in retrospect, and it's taken a long time to notice, this may be the best post-Ozzy Black Sabbath album."
485,5,"Wonderful songs, great orchestration, beautiful voices,  exactly how music should be!!!  The fabulous music gives you an instant &#34;high&#34; as you dance throughout the house.  Title:  Get High on S Always Conniff ..."
486,5,One of the best purchasing decisions I've made in my life. I will be attempting to get Spock's Music From Outer Space soon. I honestly have no idea why people find this CD's contents funny. I guess music is only good when it shows the talent of the autotune software now.
487,5,"The Best Compilation Album ever from the Bay along with West Coast Trippin'. Don't miss this, it is a masterpiece of G-Funk & Mobb Music. Every Rap Music fan has to have a copy of this."
488,1,"This is pure &#34;Free Jazz&#34; --it is totally devoid of a recognizable form.  If you are looking for melody, harmony, and rhythm (i.e. the traditional building blocks that make music what it is), you will not find them here. Indeed it is difficult to believe that this is the same musician that gave us &#34;The Four Brothers&#34; and &#34;The Train and the River.&#34; It is obvious that these are accomplished musicians who give us well executed arpeggios, scales and other snippets, but these disjointed fragments do not fit together to produce anything that seems musically satisfying. It is more delicate and not as overbearing as Ornette Coleman, but it is just as boring if not unnerving--it is an incoherent jumble that just doesn't feel like music. I found it very hard to give this CD a fair listen--the temptation is extremely strong to switch to something else. I honestly cannot find anything redeeming to recommend this album."
489,3,I don't believe this is a 120 gram vinyl as they normally come with a 120 gram vinyl sticker.  The vinyl itself feels very light and do not match as per description.  Please review and change
490,2,"I was curious about Grob-Prandl, so I listened to some of her recordings. It is a beautiful voice, but not the best voice. The recording of Turandot is interesting. She has a large voice, but not much depth in her characterization of the role. Her top notes wavered a bit at times. Her phrasing is not long and sustained, but chopped up into short sections, and her voice fades out at the end of the phrases. The Metropolitan Opera Guide to Recorded Opera calls this recording of the opera \\""little more than a blip in the Turandot discography, featuring a provincial cast of no distinction whatsoever.\\"" I agree with that review. Their review of her performance in the recording of Don Giovanni is characterized as \\""passionless and often sharp\\"". In order to judge the size of her voice I compared some of her recordings with other sopranos. She has a large voice but others are larger. Flagstad's voice is larger. Traubel's voice is larger. Nilsson's voice is larger. People who heard Nilsson sing have told me that the enormous Metropolitan Opera auditorium from the lowest level orchestra seats to the topmost balcony would vibrate from the power of her voice. The \\""big five\\"" Wagnerian sopranos are Flagstad, Traubel, Varnay, Modl, and Nilsson. After comparing recordings it is obvious that Grob-Prandl is not in the high status that they are."
491,5,what I wanted; recommend to srv fans; excellent service;would not hesitate to use again; I have complete confidence in products & reliability
492,4,"Not much needs to be said. If you're a fan you already know the songs and her incredible voice. If you're not a fan, check it out. It's a worthwhile purchase."
493,4,"This &#34;Cover to Cover , a great collection of Dot;s music in history . People of my age will enjoy .this back in time trip"
494,5,"....excellent service, the best, in fact. It's a wonderful CD with music, though forgotten by many, that still rings true."
495,4,"Barry Andrews is just too damn smart.  There's a lot of satire in this album, as there always has been in Shriekback's music... but it's not boring at all, since it sounds so damn good.  Preaching sounds like seduction or a game or all three."
496,5,I have a friend that was reminiscing about this particular song by Louis Armstrong. I purchased it for a Christmas gift. I also purchased one for myself. I love it. I am anxious to give it to my friend at Christmas
497,5,"Great recording..........Up beat fun..........I can't stop playing it.........<br />Check it out!!!.  If you could wear out a cd, this one would be history...."
498,4,"Paired with one of the ugliest and cheesiest booklets i've seen in a while (i should know-i'm a graphic designer) is an extraordinary CD by an extraordinary band. Hollenbeck just can't write a bad or cliched tune. Compositions are sophisticated, complex for the enjoyment of it, progressive, utterly original, and touch on chamber, jazz, avant and prog genres.  This one comes highly recommended as are most cds from this band."
499,5,Larry McKenna is a MASTER at interpreting the great jazz standards.  This is a beautiful CD - with Larry McKenna playing at his finest.
500,5,"If you are reading this, you are probably already aware of the brilliance of the Zimmer/Newton Howard scores for the Dark Knight Trilogy. Each one presents a beautiful score, evoking images and favorite scenes from the films while providing inspiration to even the most amateur musicians and composers. Too many of Hollywood's film scores in the last decade owe their existance to these works. But you probably already knew that, so let's move on.<br /><br />This particular CD is a collection of hilights from all three scores, performed by one of the many small-time recording orchestras popping up these days. London Music Works is one of the rare orchestras that actually puts effort and passion into their interpretations - and make no mistake, these are intrepretations. While, at timees it may feel like you are listening to the original scores, subtle nuances in tempo, instrumentation, and dynamics provide the listener with a wholely unique approach to these songs. Contributions by the equally talented City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra accentuate this album. For me, the hilights of this particular album were \\""Why So Serious?\\"" (which allows you to hear what a normal orchestra could do with this rather than Zimmer's electronically-enhanced orchestra), \\""A Watchful Guardian\\"" (which is a track that does not appear on the original \\""Dark Knight\\"" soundtrack but rather on the 2-disc special edition, making it a unique choice), and \\""Imagine The Fire\\"" and \\""Rise\\"" (both of which have obvious differences from their original versions, making them unique approaches to these songs).<br /><br />Several other reviewers are asking why you would buy this album when the original soundtracks are so readily available. The answer is simple: Just like a fan of Mozart or Beethoven's might have a favorite recording of their favorite symphony, they probably own other interpretations, allowing them, as a listener, to fully explore the possibilities of the work. Film scores are, in my opinion, the symphonies of the contemporary age. If someone is willing to offer you a new interpretation of your favorite work, and you are willing to explore the possibilities offered by that intrepretation, then do so. At the very least, it will allow you to better understand what you loved about the original recordings by Zimmer/Newton Howard. Or maybe, in these troubled economic times, you want to save a penny or two - this is a worthy supplement to those soundtracks (though I would still suggest you start saving to buy the originals). Either way, this is an affordable way to further enjoy some of the best symphonic work in the past decade."
501,5,"LaFave should be much more famous than he is. Have a number of his CDs, and they never disappoint. Heard him live several times at the Kerrville Folk Festival, and no one sings Dylan better than he does. His upbeat tunes are great road songs, his ballads rip your heart out."
502,4,What I love about this album is both the strengh of the songwriting coupled with the respect to the influences that guide this to its epiphany. Dark industrial sounds with ethereal vocals..shades of Souxsie and Joy Division make Savages a wonderful find to expand my collection. Thank you.
503,5,"Classic Ronstadt songs. I have the albums, now I have the CD's to listen to in the car. Excellent purchase."
504,5,"Sophomore albums can make or break an artist; with her second album Obel dazzles the listener with a style and an artistic vision that show confidence and mastery. I pre-ordered the album based on the strength of Philharmonics and was not disappointed, not one track feels out of place or takes a miss-step. Spare, impressionistic, beautiful arrangements of lyrics that, while sung in perfect English, add more of an instrumental quality to the music than meaning. Five stars."
505,5,I am a litttle behind time as by accident I came upon Josh Grobin on you tube and love his style of singing.  I then went out and bought this cd
506,5,"Recordings aren't especially good at capturing personal charisma, but anyone who has fallen under Sergey Khachatryan's spell in the concert hall comes away almost shaken by his ability to hold an audience in rapt silence for an entire concerto. The Armenian violinist, who is not yet thirty, offers a program of the three Brahms violin sonatas that's totally personal. It's not so much that Khachatryan has novel ideas - this is very familiar music that has been recorded many times - as his style of playing. He makes the violin \\""speak\\"" and has such a subtle touch that you almost feel that the instruments is \\""thinking.\\""  The result is magical, as if nothing stands between performer and listener, an intimate bond that few violinists, even great ones, can achieve.<br /><br />Speaking more objectively, Khachatryan's playing is softer, slower, and more inward than anyone else I've heard in the Brahms sonatas, reminding us that in the ten-year span of writing these soulful, melancholy works, Brahms went from the Violin Cto. to the Double Cto., ushering in his autumnal style. In Khachatryan's hands, this music feels like the composer musing to himself on a gently rainy day - the music becomes a tender meditation on Brahms's mortality. Sister Lusine acts as his constant accompanist in recitals, and in the past I've felt that she falls short of her brother's gifts. Here, however, her playing matches his beautifully. Her pianism is the most subdued and subtle I've ever heard in these works.<br /><br />There will always be room for the more showy and extroverted style of Stern-Barenboim and Perlman-Barenboim, to name my two favorites. And there will be listeners who won't accept Khachatryan's invitation to hear the Brahms sonatas in a completely different, personal way. Everyone else will be drawn in by his magnetic, persuasive musicality."
507,4,"Beautiful instrumentals to have as background music, relaxing, or just plain listening to...... wonderful.  I purchased this CD to play when I paint, nothing jarring, just beautiful soothing music."
508,5,"This album is incredible - features are sick Wale, Meek, Drake, Nas, John Legend, Andre 3000! Production is dope! Overall solid work!"
509,2,"the music was uncreative and unpoetic i couldnt make it through 2 tracks of this nonsense, making it in a mix of languages and putting it in a fast beat does not make it as good as burzum, its just talentless"
510,5,"This record leaves me nearly speechless.  I thought Good's \\""Beautiful Midnight\\"" and \\""Avalanche\\"" would be difficult achievements to surpass but this album may have done it.  The single \\""Had It Coming\\"" may be the weakest song on the record but the executives apparently thought it would be the most marketable.  Lyrically, it reminds me of the Talking Heads circa \\""Stop Making Sense\\"" but musically it is a solid anthemic single with a simple but utterly sublime guitar solo with a tonal quality that gives me chills every time I hear (and I tend to loathe guitar solos).  In fact, the new tone of the guitars and the upbeat urgency ofthis record is a great change from the slower, darker albums Good has released over the last few years.<br /><br />The real jewels of the album are \\""Hey Hell Heaven\\"" which is lyrically brilliant in its wordplay.  Musically it has a great drive and groove that, in my opinion, should have made this the flagship single for the record.  The album's title song \\""Arrows of Desire\\"" (taken from William Blake)  is also another rocking tune that drives this album forward.  \\""We're Long Gone\\"" is another anthemic rocker that will remind Good fans of something from \\""White Light\\"" as it is just a loud, raw song that will be a lot of fun to hear at a Good concert.  \\""Via Dolorsa\\"" is the first tune Good wrote for the album and is a little less formulaic in its arrangement from the other songs that highlight this album.<br /><br />\\""Arrows of Desire\\"" is a much simpler album than Good's las two releases but this is far from a bad thing as this album is more upbeat (but still lyrically dark and ironic) and simply rocks.  It may very well  vie to be my new favorite album of all time.  It is unfortunate that I can only rate it five-stars as it is deserving of much more."
511,4,"This 1970s vocal quartet named The Reflections hailed from New York City - Herman Edwards, Josh Pridjen and brothers Edmund \\""Butch\\"" and John Simmonds (died at age 45 on March 16, 1989) - and spent part of 1972 as the backing group for Melba Moore at her live appearances, but there is no record of them ever cutting a disc with Melba.<br /><br />Their music tends to get lost in the shuffle due to having the same group name as a 1960s \\""blue-eyed soul\\"" group from Detroit, who had one big hit, (Just Like) Romeo And Juliet, a # 6 Billboard Pop Hot 100 in April/May 1964 on Golden World 9 (not bad for a small label and at a time when the British Invasion was making it tough for all but the best North American artists to crack the upper regions of the Hot 100), and two very minor entries (Like Columbus Did - # 96 in July 1964) and Poor Man's Son (# 55 in March 1966).<br /><br />By 1975, this black group had the advantage of a giant label - Capitol Records - pushing their discs, and in June-July they had the driving disco entry Three Steps From True Love get to # 9 R&B b/w How Could We Let The Love Get Away? on Capitol 4078. The best the A-side could do on the more lucrative Hot 100, however, was a low # 94, and the follow-up Love On Delivery (L.O.D.) did even worse there, being blanked completely, although it managed a weak # 58 R&B in October b/w One Into One on Capitol 4137.<br /><br />Even so, the label gave them a 1975 album - the one covered here in vinyl and in a 2011 Japanese import CD - titled \\""Love On Delivery\\"" (vinyl LP Capitol ST-11460 - CD Capitol QIAG-70010) containing: 1. Day After Day (Night After Night) (4:35); 2. Love On Delivery (L.O.D.) (5:30); 3. Now You've Taken Your Love (5:40); 4. Are You Ready? (Here I Am) (3:39); 5. She's My Summer Breeze (4:23); 6. All Day, All Night (3:31); 7. One Into One (4:15); 8. Telephone Lover (4:03); 9. How Could We Let The Love Get Away? (4:12); 10. Three Steps From True Love (3:43).<br /><br />All four sides of their first two singles are in the album as are both sides of their third and fourth singles, Day After Day (Night After Night), which peaked at # 37 R&B in March 1976 b/w Are You Ready?

512,1,This is not a CD of Jacky Cheung. Someone has made a mistake. This is a lady. I want Jacky Fever.
513,1,"Nowhere, on this album, do I hear the gravelly tones of Bob's voice laying down the wry comments that we listeners all think we're going to hear as part of buying 'Theme Time Radio Hour WITH YOUR HOST BOB DYLAN' (????????)<br />Don't buy this series (Season Two and Three are the same) if you think you're going to get Bob along for the show. Sad news folks."
514,3,"It could have been a whole lot better if they would have not been so stingy with pedal steel, fiddles, and harmony singers on almost EVERY song. The producer and sound engineers seemed to have done their best to get the country OUT of this record, in spite of Sheryl's nice country sounding vocals on most songs (several of the songs were non country and very much in the standard Sheryl Crow genre). A good example of that would be 'We Oughta Be Drinking' even with Whiskey River, Nashville, and country song references, it is slow and can't find a direction. This is a case of less was less.  If it is gonna be country, make it sound undeniable, ok? I am disappointed but, a remix could have fixed almost ALL of the problems here.. That said several tracks were very good productions as they stood and deserve honorable mention. 'Callin' Me When I'm Lonely' &#34;Waterproof Mascara' were pretty nice as they stood. Remixing would have saved 'Crazy Ain't Original' and made it the anthem it tried to be. 'Nobody's Business' was way to close to Bad Company material that will remain unnamed but I am SURE will draw instant parallels in your mind. All of this stuff considered, Sheryl's vocals are sound and if she tries again with a better production like 'Heart of Texas Records', she could get it right."
515,3,"I first heard a couple of tracks from this release on a Mixcloud set by Slovakian DJ Adam Kuvasca. I was stunned by the complex horn charts and arrangements. It reminded me of a Gil Evans album with an R&B tinge. Since then I have learned that Webster is an experienced Deep House DJ and Producer and Wraight has written arrangements for Herbert's big band and several film scores. This album is really a surprise.<br />Great musicianship, great tunes, and a vibe that so much of new generation jazz attempts, but fails to achive. A true balance between an EDM sensibility and large ensemble jazz. If you're a fan of Cinematic Orchestra you'll get it!"
516,4,"This is a two CD 2013 Mercury records release. It contains 24 tracks with a total playing time of one hour and forty-one minutes. The compositions are alternate versions and outtakes from the five original albums RS made during his 1969 -74 contract with Mercury records. All the material has been previously released throughout the years in various compilations and box sets.<br /><br /> However, this is the first time all the tracks have appeared within one release. The sound quality is relatively flawless. The twenty-three page booklet contains comprehensive liner notes authored by Scott Schinder. There's also a detailed listing of time, place and musicians associated with each track.<br /><br />This release captures the young artist evolving as a major solo rock / blues /folk performer. During this period, Rod had a duel career, fronting the Faces, as well as pursuing a solo career. Eventually, with the mega seller release of\\"" Every Picture Tells a Story\\"" and the hit single\\""Maggie May\\"", Rod would depart the Faces.<br /><br />Additionally, the session musicians playing on these recordings are all rock legends.<br />Ronnie Wood, Ian McLagan and Kenny Jones were all Rods' mates from the Faces. Mike Waller was the drummer in Rod's earlier band, Steampacket and he also was a member with RS in the Jeff Beck Group.<br /><br /> Pete Sears played on several studio dates with Rod and he would eventually make his mark with Jefferson Starship. Martin Quittenton, aside from being a guitar virtuoso, also co-wrote \\""Maggie May\\"".<br /><br />Last but not least, the legendary Long John Baldry and Madeline Bell on backing vocals is truly a musical pleasure.<br /><br />Fans who appreciate this period of Rod's career will be richly rewarded by rediscovering the songs through alternate versions and outtakes. Some of the tracks are in an embryonic stage with Rod adding and changing lyrics and the musicians altering tempos and arrangements. All this material is worth a listen. The music public is fortunate this material exists and was finally released in one box set.<br /><br />It captures a musical time and place that will never be repeated."
517,5,"The boys are back with soulful tunes and rich harmonies. It's different to their pure pop style of old, but fantastic nonetheless"
518,5,"George's last album is wonderful.  Like I said before, you are either a George Duke fan and know what to expect, or you may be plesantly surprised if you like to ride the Dukie Stick and get funky.  My favorite keyboard player is #1 on progressive climaxing solos!"
519,5,"Breathless from the 80's is a tough dig for those that like 80's rock. This is a compilation of the two albums they released back in the early 80's. If you can find it and you like the likes of April Wine, this is for you. Keep In mind almost everything by &#34;Breathless&#34; is OOP."
520,4,Loved this CD and the white noise it provides me for sleeping.  I recommend it for anyone who needs to relax and get a good nights sleep.
521,3,"It was not what I was expecting.  I was expecting more based on the reviews of this CD.  I wish there were samples to be played.  Perhaps, that is why there were none."
522,5,"Very good CD, music is nice to listen too, would recommend to buy. I also recommend her nail polish line for anyone who is interested and has not tried them yet..Their beautiful colors!"
523,5,Great look back into some 70's classic songs.I remember hearing many of these songs on my little am/fm radio while on the beach.
524,5,"This is undoubtedly one of Bobby's best albums.  I listen to it a lot.  Next to Sinatra, Bobby is my favorite."
525,5,This is my type of music. I skipped one track. If I was having a better day I would have been up for that too.
526,4,"I really like smooth jazz, especially if the piano is center stage.  I wasn't familiar with Brian Culbertson, but I really enjoy this CD.  For me, it's good as soothing background music when I'm doing things that require my attention."
527,4,I like SS and this is a fine album.  I bought it for &#34;Treasures&#34; and &#34;Under a Blue and Cloudless Sky&#34; in particular.  Those two racks are worth the price.  Consider the rest as bonus material and rate it 5 starl
528,5,"While I have grown to love all the stages this band has grown through, I still love the sound I originally discovered as a teen listening to public radio in Tampa FL. Small Town England is worth the price of the entire record, but I love Spirit of the Falklands, and Running too."
529,5,Hands down the best slayer album ever!!! If you've never heard slayer before this is the album to buy!!!  One of the best heavy death metal albums ever for that era!!! Lyrics are intense not for kids... I looked all over for this album and could not find (brand new) in any stores. Thanks amazon for always coming through for me!!!!
530,5,Kidz Pop CDs are popular music for children without bad words.  I use it as a teacher and my students love it.
531,5,"I highly recommend Dr. Jean for anyone who teaches and works with children (parents, daycare, etc).  buy it and see the fun you can have!"
532,5,Love it!!!!!! Heard it years ago and finally bought it. I absolutely love it and would buy it again if I could
533,3,"On Caress of Steel, Rush is like a young eaglet stretching its wings and learning to fly. The band showed a great leap forward on Fly By Night thanks to the addition of drummer/lyricist Neal Peart. They experimented with long-form songs, showing promise on By-Tor and the Snow Dog. Here, the band wades into deeper waters and flounders around a bit. They're trying, and really hard, maybe too hard.<br /><br />The album kicks off with a rocker about..... the French Revolution. &#34;And they're marching to Bastille Day. The guillotine will claim it's bloody prize.&#34; Heady stuff. It's followed by a tongue in cheek I Think I'm Going Bald, then a sentimental Lakeside Park. If that doesn't confuse you, just wait. The Necromancer is a multi-part, twelve-minute suite that borrows from Tolkien and features a creepy narration that moves the story along and provide some flow for the otherwise disjointed musical passages, At least it has some flow. That's totally missing from Fountains of Lamneth, a nineteen-minute plus epic about ... something, I can't tell what. Something about life and a sea journey and the search for some fountain. The lyrics are cliche-ridden, obscure, and don't really say much.<br /><br />The album ended up selling less than Fly By Night, and nearly got the band dropped by its label. It still languishes in obscurity. It's not for the casual Rush fan, but it does have its merits.The band is in fine form although still trying to find it's prog soul. Despite all this, I still listen to Caress of Steel and enjoy it. When 2112 broke the band wide open, and many of my friends began listening to Rush for the first time, Caress of Steel was my little secret that I could pull out and lay on my friends. They didn't get it, and I still don't get most of it, but it's not a bad listen."
534,4,"Continuing on from where Airmech left off, this is an (thankfully) all-electronic masterpiece of programming.  There's a lot of little flourishes to find buried in the songs and they only sound better when you really sit down and actively study them as opposed to blasting them as background/driving music.<br /><br />The biggest fault is that it's a little weak on melodies.  Airmech has by far the catchier toons - I would recommend anyone who likes this album to pick that up this instance if you haven't already.  Still, it's a fine return to form after FLA seemingly got caught in a bit of a rut.  Thankfully the guitars are gone - not that I hate metal, but FLAs take on it really wasn't that great other than Hard Wired.  I still think it's pretty amazing that a 27 year old band can sound this modern!  The lyrics a bit iffy, but hey, it's Leeb.<br /><br />Here's to hoping Leeb still has a few more albums left in him!"
535,5,A great collection of Original Hits all on one CD !<br />Memories of the Juke Box and Ice Cream Parlor hangout !
536,5,"What a classic, as presented & timely delivery, more of the early Fleetwood Mac, pre-Stevie Nicks years, still a welcome addition to anybody's audio collection."
537,5,This CD fulfills its name.....it is enchanting. I am a massage therapist and use this CD on a regular basis. My clients love it and are really able to relax with the beautiful and enchanting songs.
538,5,"i didn't even hear about this band until the lead singer had already passed away (tragically, from pneumonia), but, after i did, i knew i needed all the material they ever put out. i have set about this task, and amazon has been most helpful in that regard."
539,5,"Why is it again that she doesnt' take up more space in my collection?  This is a real hidden gem, a slight yet welcome departure for her. A thick, syrupy, edgy mix  of bluesy, darkish ballads, boot-kickin'  stuff that I like to play all the way through  WITHOUT skipping! Yummy"
540,1,"Michael Jackson songs really need to be as pure as the artist intended them to be.  Please do not waste your time with this this album, it does not pay respect to the artist and really disappoints on all levels.  If you want a Michael Jackson compilation consider the Ultimate Box Set or the Number Ones.  You will get quality songs made by the artist and not butchered by someone else's interpretation of a \\""remix\\""."
541,4,"This CD is pretty good, but not up to normal Rancid album standards.  However, it is very much worth it if only for the song &#34;The Brothels&#34;."
542,5,"This album is awesome!  If you like any Five Finger Death Punch album you will love this!  This is as good as \\""The Way Of The Fist!\\"" (which was my favorite album).  Do yourself a favor and buy this album!!!  (Ignore the reviews of the haters this album is great!)"
543,5,"on time and right items and no hidden costs, thanks for this service and would use again and again have a good day"
544,4,"I usually don't listen to country, but heard his voice in a song recently, so I found this one. It's ok. It does have some really good bluegrass in some."
545,5,"I bought this cd for just one song, little did I know I would love every trac.  I can listen to this cd all day long, and do.  I hope they produce more great music!"
546,5,Purchased as a gift & he absolutely loves it...arrived really quickly as well.  Very nice set...perfect gift for any AC/DC fan.
547,4,"I am surprised that there are no reviews, and no songs listed from this CD. But let me try.  I can't figure out how to paste the list...Morgan Heritage, Buju Banton, Anthony B. I first got this CD about ten years ago and it was stolen by an evil ex-beau. But thanks to the vast selection at amazon.com, I have been putting things together for audio and books. If you love Reggae, you are sure to find some favs that will stick with you through the ages. Again, a must have for the Reggae Library."
548,5,"I have enjoyed Yves Montand in the movies more than fifty years ago, and his singing took me to Paris long before I finally arrived there in person. Now, all I have to do is listen to this CD, close my eyes, and I am transported back to the unique charms of Paris - understanding French is never required. Enjoy!"
549,4,"I like how the words can be displayed on the tv, and all the songs are popular choices. I only wish I could hear the lyrics being sung as a prompt instead of just relying on the words. But either way, all expectations for a karaoke CD met."
550,5,This is one of my favorite CDs! The CD came on time and without any apparent damage markings. Definably would do it again!...now I just need a better CD player..
551,5,This Roy Acuff cd is a steal at $5. The high quality sound makes it very enjoyable. I found it intriguing that 3 songs had extra content not released in the original songs. &#34;Roy Acuff's Greatest Hits&#34; does not have near as many older hits as this one. I recommend this cd to anyone who is a Roy Acuff fan.
552,4,"A really good disc, with a nice mastering. Unfortunately, discs do not fit well in the sleeves... It is a bit regrettable"
553,4,"I know many people didn't give this album high reviews, but I think it is a very emotional work of Mariah Carey, this isn't my favorite album from her, but i respect her for trying completely different things on this album. The features on this album are so much fun, and many of the songs have a 90s feel to them, so i would even call this album nostalgic"
554,5,I heard this CD when I was up visiting a friend in Montana.  I just loved her voice and the songs are very soothing.
555,5,"I happen to have the neighbors who blast their radio, drink beer day and night and curse like sailors. The only way I can stand to sit on my patio is to be able to drown them out. This tape is perfect."
556,5,"Creative and Beautiful Natural Settings!  The selections on this second CD of The Piano Guys is awesome!  I'm a pianist, so this music resonates with me!  I Love It!<br />Chadwick Vincent"
557,5,"This is an excellent double CD.  It contains four groups of works:<br />Sacred music - choral works for liturgical use<br />Funeral music for Queen Mary<br />Nine songs for countertenor accompanied by various combinations of lute, gamba and harpsichord, and<br />Instrumental music from Diolclesian (plus two other pieces)<br /><br />The music itself is a delight.  Purcell was a really fine composer, and the music presented here is inventive, tuneful and harmonically brilliant.  Much of it was new to me, and I confess that I bought this set partly because it was so absurdly cheap that I thought it would be worth a try.  It turned out to be excellent and I am delighted with it - particularly the Funeral Music and the instrumental pieces from Dioclesian.<br /><br />The other thing that drew me to the set was the performers.  The Choir of Clare College, Cambridge, while less illustrious than their neighbours at King's, are very good and the instrumentalists include Crispian Steele-Perkins, Andrew Manze, Rachel Podger and Ashley Solomon, no less.  The songs (which include a fabulously lovely version of An Evening Hymn, by the way) are sung by Michael Chance and accompanied by Richard Boothby, Maggie Cole and Nigel North.  I have been unable to find out anything about when these recordings were made or originally issued, but these are all now stellar names and they give performances to match.<br /><br />This set is really excellent and a monumental bargain.  You simply can't go wrong here if you like 17th Century music or would like to get to know it.  Very warmly recommended."
558,5,This is one you will revisit again and again. The original lyrics are outstanding ! This is a must have for any fan.
559,5,Mr. Stait is one of my fiance's favorite country western artist. Our first dance will be to &#34;Cross My Heart.&#34;
560,5,I've been a Lionel Richie fan for a lot of years and when i heard a portion of this cd at a friends i decided i needed to buy it for me.
561,3,It was pretty good . It had some big hits on it  & some other prety good songs . But there were some mediocre songs on it too.<br />It was in good condition.
562,5,I've always been a fan of Paul Anka's and I totally enjoyed these duets! The selection of songs were wonderful!
563,5,"Cheap Trick's 3rd studio album \\""Heaven Tonight\\"", is a classic all the way around.  After their more pop album \\""In Color\\"", they come out smokin' on this one.  \\""Surrender\\"", is one of their signature tunes, always liked the lyric \\""Mom And Dad Rolling On the Couch, Rolling Numbers, Got My Old Kiss Records Out\\"".  Love Tom Petersson's bass on \\""On Top of the World\\"", the guitar rave-up, with a disturbing message about addiction.  Their great take on The Move's classic \\""California Man\\"",  written by Roy Wood, Cheap Trick made this their own, Zander almost sounds like Wood and Lynne here.  \\""High Roller\\"", Nielsen's guitar strut on this track is just amazing.  \\""Auf Wiedersehn\\"", the anthem about suicide,  the word play at the end and the band just blows your mind on this number. \\""Takin' Me Back\\"", a synth driven tune, nice rhythm's.  Then we get a song as slight as \\""On The Radio\\"", a 50's sound, just a fun time.  The title track, with it's message about trying too many drugs and floating to heaven, Robin Zander's vocals make this one, love the orchestration on this track.  Rick brings out the power on \\""Stiff Competition\\"", love the melodic shifts.  \\""How Are You?\\"", very Beatles, kind of like \\""Good Morning Good Morning\\"", from Sqt. Peppers\\"".  The bonus tracks are fairly good, nothing mind blowing.  After this one everyone would know who Cheap Trick was, on their Live album \\""At Budokan\\"", in 1979."
564,5,"I listen Puffy a long time ago, and this album was the best, From beginning to end it's exciting, this is my best bought in long time.<br />I love Puffy >_&lt;"
565,5,This is a child wonder.  I'd like to purchase every CD she has made.  I'll continue to work on just doing that.
566,5,"I bought this album because I really liked his performances on American Idol. While I found this album to have a slightly different flavor than the predormances I saw, I throughly enjoye his music."
567,5,"I dint know why I like this musician, but he has a very special aura about him. He is for real!!!"
568,5,I have always enjoyed Nat King Cole and George Benson's music. This seems to be Benson's best yet. Menzel and Hill's duets with Benson  are great on this tribute. I played it for my elementary age students and they loved it. It is funny how all generations are enjoying Nat King Cole's music.  The combination of Benson's  voice (and his guitar) and the Henry Mancini Institute orchestra (flute and violin solos) in Nature Boy were incredible. The arrangements of Randy Waldman got the best out of everyone. It is just so relaxing. I already bought some for gifts-
569,5,"I was hesitant to buy this because every year there seems to be a new peanuts collection that i hope will have unreleased songs, but turns out to be mainly a rehash. However, I am a sucker for anything peanuts so i took a chance. The recordings are in most cases unique versions, and the quality and or length makes this a great disc for the collector."
570,5,This is a really good pop/alternative cd.  There really are no songs on the entire album that are horrible. Highly recommend.
571,5,Everything you need from Simon and Garfunkel is right here. Anyone who loves this group will no doubt love this box set. Great songs.
572,5,"If you love the old hymns that we grew up with, this is your CD!!  Precious Memories Volumes 1 and 2 are awesome!!  Am so glad I purchased for myself and got a set for my Dad and Mom."
573,5,"This is the only Corelli I own so far, but it is a favourite album. Grumiaux and Castagnone perform. I love this relaxing baroque music. You will, too."
574,4,I like his attitude toward loyalty to America and what it stands for. Would recommend this to all of my friends.
575,5,I love this album! Cher Lloyd is amazing and I love all her songs. They are such fun songs to mess around and dance too.
576,5,"I saw these gentlemen on a fund raiser for a public televison channel.  I was hooked.  When I saw that they had out a CD, I knew I had to get it.  You will not be disappointed."
577,5,"This review is on both the album itself and the vinyl edition of the album.<br /><br />The album:<br />The album is a very good album. However, it should be noted that its different than their past stuff. The album is basically Daft Punk doing Disco music. Normally, I hate Disco. However, this album is a rare exception. They seem to have managed to take all of the redeemable aspects of Disco and combine it with their signature sound. That being said, the album is also very interested because it features Daft Punk working with a full band on the songs and even an orchestra on some of the material. The album features contributions by big names like Nile Rodgers (Cher), Pharrell Williams (N.E.R.D., The Neptunes), and Paul Williams. In addition to the big names, the music features experienced session musicians that have worked on some very famous recordings like Michael Jackson's Thriller.<br /><br />The vinyl:<br />The vinyl edition of the album features the album spread over two 180 gram 12\\""s. These twelve inches are housed in a gatefold sleeve that also houses a card with a code to download the album and a few page booklet that features the album's credits (who played on what) and the lyrics to the songs. After listening to both the vinyl and the mp3s that come with the record, I would have to say that the vinyl is highly superior in sound quality. Even though I listened to both versions on the same speakers, I was surprised that the mp3s did not had the same in-depth low end groove that the vinyl did. After doing some reading on the album online, I found out that the album was almost exclusively recorded in analog with high end gear. Because of this, it makes sense that the vinyl edition sounds better.<br /><br />Overall:<br />Daft Punk does Disco. I very much like the album. It features Daft Punk going an interesting direction that almost seems to a beautiful 180 from what the majority of popular artists are doing. However, if you expect to hear old school Daft Punk, I would recommend that you check out some of the tracks before you buy the album. Some of my favorite songs are \\""Get Lucky\\"", \\""Giorgio by Moroder\\"", and \\""Doin' It Right\\"". In closing, I will note that the vinyl edition may be a bit of leap price wise but I strongly believe that it sounds better."
578,5,"I like compilations like this one as they tend to have the songs you remember by the one-hit wonders (or at least from those who only had a handful of hits). However it also means the quality can be uneven - or at least more so than if it was a greatest hits collection from a so-called super group.<br /><br />I didn't care for 'Friends and Lovers', for example, the first time around but for the most part I would rate this a very solid 'buy' for anyone who was in their teens or early 20's in the mid 70's to the mid 80's. There are 19 songs on this CD unlike some of the collections (where they might only have 10 or 12 songs).<br /><br />I would rate this a very good 8.5 out of 10 for this one!"
579,5,"Contains the mid-career hits, plus a couple of early hits left off his first greatest hits cd.  While a number of songs have largely been forgotten, there are a few that are still being played.  A must for anyone who likes Tim McGraw, and is missing many of his pre 2006 hits."
580,5,"I have listened to this album several times since I purchased it based on the reviews on Amazon.<br /><br />Something Unto Nothing is destined to become a classic in rock history.  If S.U.N. has any faults, it may be that they are too over the top, somehow.  The vocals are too strong, the hooks are too compelling, the flow of the album is too smooth.  Even the album cover art is perfect.<br /><br />Bravo!"
581,5,"Michael Castaldo's CD Acelo is one of the best Cd i have heard in some time.  I am a disabled veteran in a lot of pain.  Listening to this Cd relaxes me where i dont have to take much pain medication.  His voice and his music is so relaxing and smooth.  My favorite cuts from this Cd is ave maria, lo credo, and Va Va Penslero.  I am looking forward to hearing a whole lot more from this amazing artist."
582,5,Great collection of songs done by a true american master of music. I would definitely recommend this CD. Johnny Cash is one of a kind.
583,5,Love Love LOVE the music on this cd! They have progressed musically in a way most bands cannot: they got BETTER!
584,5,"If you like calming music that is therapeutic, then this cd is for you....I love this music and have notice a change in my mood when listening to it....Blessings!"
585,5,"I can still rember where I was, when the world found out that april fool's day that marvin gaye had died. then the dream of a lifetime was released ."
586,5,"This CD is part of a series of 5 CDs produced by Simitar Ent. that showcase Miami Booty Bass music. In reality, it should be considered Dirty South Booty Bass because the music was popularized and produced by artists from all over the entire SouthEastern region of the U.S.A. in the 1990s. The genre even stretched as far as Seattle, WA with songs like \\""Baby Got Back\\"" by Sir Mix-A-Lot. The genre then mutated and traveled overseas under the guise of \\""electro bass\\"" but usually contained no lyrics.<br /><br />\\""Booty Bass\\"" (as it were) was a genre of music built by men who frequented (mostly black) strip clubs in the SouthEast region of the U.S.A. (Florida, Georgia, Alabama, etc.). Strippers needed music to dance to and that's where \\""Booty Bass\\"" music came in. However, it was generally great dance music so it was then played on radio and in clubs all across the country.<br /><br />If you like this CD, get the full set (in order) by Simitar Ent. here:<br />CD 1/5 [[ASIN:B00CBDQHC4 D.J.

587,5,"If you like wonderfulness, you will love this album. Just. Ugh. So good. I've listened to it on repeat, pretty much, this past weekend, and let me tell you, it's been one of the few highlights of my weekend."
588,2,I heard one song on this project I liked. The producers just used too many electronic instrumental ideas and no live instruments. I didn't give it a one start because it says I hated it so it gets a two star. Not happy with these projects at all.
589,2,"Majic Slim sounds more like he is from England. Eric Clapton sounds better from that stand point of view. But wait, I have'nt taken the time to sit down and listen to the entire album :-)."
590,4,These boy bands may not be the Beatles but the CD has catching tunes and the girls enjoyed them. Some songs are still on the their I-Pods.
591,5,"Mario Plank is singing better than he ever sing, the musics are very good.<br />If you like a good symphonic metal, you have to hear Ethera."
592,5,Great album.  Great sound and not damaged during transport.  If you buy vinyl this one is one you should have in your collection.
593,5,This is one of the best Don Carlos cd's out. It's classic roots reggae with a fantastic band-Roots Radics backing Don. This should be in any Don Carlos collection and be at the top of the list!
594,4,"I bought this for my husband, he really liked BTO years ago, he likes this CD. Mostly good songs, just what I expected!"
595,5,"My wife had heard Karen at a friends house. Really liked her music, this was a surprise gift for her."
596,5,Lindsey is really amazing. I really enjoyed the blending of violin and dub step. My favorite song is Electric Daisy!
597,5,all i got to say is buy this album pure 80s pop you wont regret it trust me phenomenal album.
598,5,"I bought this for my mother for Christmas, years ago, and then I had to buy a set for myself. It is still my mother's favorite CD(s). Ferrante & Teicher had 4 top ten hits, not all of which are in this collection - because it is specifically love songs, I guess. But it is an excellent set of music; I love these melodies, and you will most likely love them, too."
599,5,Great album! so glad i got my hands on a copy &#60;3 now i have all of their albums!!!! LOVE IT!!!
600,5,Nice Solo-album.  The album shows a different side of the artist from her normal routine with the group Brown Eyed Girls. A variety of music sounds.
601,5,"I haven't bought an entire cd in a long time. I'm usually so disappointed because I'll only like one song, if I'm lucky, I'll like two. With this cd, I can't decide which is my favorite: &#34;For your glory&#34;.  You'll definitely &#34;smile&#34; when you buy this cd!!! Love it!!!"
602,4,"I liked this CD, but my very favorite is the Tibetan meditation with the bowls. I gave this CD as a gift."
603,5,It was a christmas present and she loves the wizard of oz as do i and this was a great musical that we can enjoy together
604,5,My 18 month granddaughter loves this CD.  We have to have it on all the time and she dances around.
605,5,"Great edition to the Stryper catalog. Been a fan since Yellow and Black Attack and it is great to hear the classics with better production.  If you are a fan, you must obtain a copy today."
606,5,"Louis Spohr is generally unknown, and perhaps, this is due to a lack of mental capacity of music critics in the early twentieth century who just restricted their interest to a handful of composers. But Louis Spohr is among the top group. Maybe, his music was too modern at times, too innovative at others, his range of styles to vivid to grab? This CD gives a peek view of his composing capabilities and the interpretation is as good as it can get.<br /><br />An absolute pleasure for anyone who loves classical music already, and maybe a few others get introduced with this CD to this form of emotional expressions."
607,4,"Prime Cuts: In Your Sight, Like Jesus Loves, Time for the Show<br /><br />If Whitney Houston or Leona Lewis can sing about human love with such bombastic conviction why do Christian artists have to sluggishly whimper when they sing about the greatest love of all?  Kerrie Roberts joins a small sliver of female Christian artists such as Natalie Grant or Nichole Nordeman who are not afraid to stretch their multiple octaves sopranos over long holding notes in praise of Jesus Christ.  The first thing to say about this Florida native is that this gal can sing, really sing. When she flaunts her vocal supremacy she can definitely wow the judges on \\""American Idol\\"" with her caterwauling melisma.  Thus, it comes as no surprise that her song \\""Unstoppable\\"" was selected for a TV spot promoting the tenth season of \\""American Idol\\"" in 2010. \\""Time for the Show,\\"" Roberts' sophomore album for Reunion Records, follows on the heels of the template set by her eponymous debut.  As the titular \\""Time for the Show\\"" hints, this is a big pop-sounding record with high power ballads and suave dance vibe anthems.  If comparisons are to be made, Kelly Clarkson in her \\""Breakaway\\"" era comes to mind.  However, the major departure with this record is that while her debut only had a couple of up-tempo songs, here a balance struck where ballads only constitute only half the album.<br /><br />Regardless of how hip the peppy songs are, with a voice like Roberts, you have got to hear her when she belts a ballad.  Sky scraping vocal moments abound with the power ballad \\""In Your Sight.\\""  Though Roberts soars with lots of breath holding notes, her performance only enhances her desperate need to  trust Jesus:  \\""I will rest, knowing You are holding me/I believe You will never say goodbye/ I close my eyes, unafraid of what I cannot see,/because I am always In Your sight.\\""  \\""Like Jesus Loves\\"" another gem of a ballad is a majestic exposition of the kenosis of Jesus Christ, how the King of glory loves us so much to come to live and die amongst us.  Much more cluttered in its production with some piercing drum beats is the lead single \\""Finally Home.\\"" Here Roberts puts to music the feeling of belonging when we come in submission to Christ.  Candid and confessional is \\""Middle of It All\\"" where Roberts admits her own fears and her need to run to Christ.  Listen especially to the delightful jazzy Vanessa Carlton-esque piano riffs.<br /><br />This time round there are more propulsive burners.  Most creative is the cleverly nuanced \\""Time for the Show.\\""  The show Roberts is referring to is our lives.  And here she is inviting Christ to be the main actor in this show we call life.  Beautifully weaving scriptural threads of our need to be a city on a hill that cannot be hid, this is just the perfect example of how Scripture and art come into play.  The issue of our struggling self-image is indeed perplexing and perpetual for many today, especially our teenage girls.  And Roberts deals with it in the light of Psalm 139 in the radio friendly \\""Masterpiece.\\""  While on \\""Sing\\"" she gets into her praise and worship drive packing in full gear ready to praise her Lord.<br /><br />As much as it is a joy to see Roberts branching out to deal with more fast paced songs, a few such as \\""What Are You Afraid of\\"" and \\""Wake Up\\"" are more formulaic pop.

608,5,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS 3-DISC CD! There were no nicks or scratches on the case or CD's. Very clean. The case is not plastic, it's a like a mat board/cardboard type."
609,1,"Two of the best songwriters and arrangers in the business and this is the best they can come up with?  spare me!  emmylou even slaughtered the wonderful &#34;Spanish Dancer&#34; by Patti Scialfa.  Jesus peeps, we're still paying attention."
610,4,i thought this cd of etta james is a great cd without paying a top price for it. the cd has all her best hits on it that i wanted.k williams australia.
611,5,I haven't found a record of his that I don't like.  I have tried to get all of his and this one is wonderful.
612,5,Hey it's Carlos and what a great collection of his hits. Have listened to it for hours and have no regrets.
613,5,Soundworks has done it again!  One more one the list of CDs that document the audio history of this country.
614,5,"Beautiful, relaxing without being repetitive and annoying. But be aware that it is one hour long. Nice to go to sleep or nap to. But not necessarily for a 20- or 30-minute meditation session. Highly recommend."
615,5,These songs are very thoughtful and meaningful. They help me to feel closer to God and express my feelings of praise. Singer is confident and unique. Accompaniments are professional.
616,5,"Prior to synthesizers one had to rely on the imagination of artists such as Airto Moreira to provide an ethereal sound through their instruments.  I heard the song Wind Chant probably more than 40 years ago on the radio while drivng somewhere.  He did what the song's title implies with percussion instruments.  What else do you expect from a family of healers?  If, you learn nothing else by listening to this you should learn that we should not let technology erase these things from our culture."
617,5,This album or CD has all of the premier blue grass legends on it. All hall of famers in their own right and all in their prime playing together.  Get it NOW!
618,5,I bought this cd as used. But it was practically new.... It's awesome for the price. And album was awesome
619,5,"I didn't get the album til Jan 1st...I decided to play it for one month before putting it away with the other Christmas albums. We sang, &#34;Sleigh Bells&#34; til Feb 1st...*every day* in the car. I never get tired of Christmas music, and I never skip a song on this album! The WHOLE album is great! It's our top favorite!"
620,5,"Every bit as a must-have as this (unassumingly, follow-up?) Hounds Of Hasselvander 'The Ninth Hour' CD. Tunes here that make this title a keeper are the full-throttled head-banging rocker \\""Pull The Switch\\"", \\""She Serpent\\"", the eight-minute earth-pounding scorcher \\""Last Call\\"", the [truly] inspiring head-riveting \\""Seen The Light\\"" and the powerful \\""Take Up Your Cross\\"". Whew! This CD simply so R-O-C-K-S! Just an all-around great stoner metal to thoroughly take in. Should appeal to fans of Saint Vitus, Pentagram (obviously), Electric Wizard, Orange Goblin, Sheavy, Sleep, Spirit Caravan and Fireball Ministry. Need I say more?"
621,3,"Purchased this in advance of its debut, thrilled to have it 2 days after release with free amazon.com shipping.<br />A new CD for Josh Groban is always enjoyed, however, found myself disenfranchised from this particular ensemble with fewer heartfelt and memorable melodies. &#34;Brave&#34; is my favorite on this CD, and I thought &#34;When I fall in Love&#34; was a remake of Nat King Cole, however, it is not. Still a nice song, just not the tune I knew. Not a fan of his duet with Laura Pausini as she is whiney, grating, and detracts from Josh.<br />3 Stars because I was unaware that a limited release of same CD with 4 bonus tracks, Changing Colors;Satellite; (nice remake of Dave Matthews Band version), Grazie; and my very favorite of this release Josh's version of Neil Diamond's &#34;Play Me,&#34; was available only at Target, whose website, unlike amazon.com, does not list the tracks on the CD or allow you to preview them. As a Grobanite, I rushed to Target and purchased the extended version and very glad I did.<br />If you are a Grobanite, or buying this as a gift for someone who is Josh-crazy, you should know that the more Josh the better, as is the case with the extended version and more melodic and enjoyable. Get the one with the bonus tracks, some of the strongest songs of this release."
622,5,Absolutey finest music collction from them. The only thing better wouldbe to have them perform live - here in my living room!
623,5,"Why does everyone keep saying &#34;I love this DJ&#34; &#34;Best DJ ever&#34; &#34;amazing things with turntables&#34; ??? LOOK AT THE TITLE... this is a live set, and that's what he's done PLAY LIVE, no turntables, no records."
624,5,"Sorry it took so so long to write a review..We help the Veterans and we are very busy...But we would like to Thank you for this wonderful product and being one of the steps we choose to give someone a smile!!!!  Good deals, pricing and shipping!!!"
625,3,"The last few Rush albums have only been for my Rush collection and not for anything else.  There are only couple of songs that I really like from Clockwork Angels which is more then I can say for their last effort.  I had to listen to this album several times to even understand what message they were trying to convey.  That being said, I have not read the book that goes with the music so I might not have full picture."
626,5,Swingin' Dors is a great Cd from 1960 ! Diana Dors could sing well. A Particular favorite is Come By Sunday. Her best acting was in The Devil's Web.
627,5,"I guess many songs I like are not classified as Soul, such as Last Dance.  I guess that is classified as disco.  A lot of songs that are good, but not enough of the great songs I was looking for."
628,5,"This CD, When My Heart Finds Christmas, really contributed to getting the Christmas Spirit. I love the songs. One was a favorite my mom used to sing to me when I was a little girl."
629,5,Everyone already knows Adele is awesome.  What more can be said that hasn't already been said?  She's just absolutely great!
630,5,"David A Saylor - one man AOR machine. Yes, everything on this release is played, written and produced by the man himself. That means a fair slice of programming and no real emphasis on any one instrument - besides his voice of course.<br />Thankfully his voice does make up for the lack of real drums, it's a pretty likable pure AOR voice - deeper perhaps than what is the norm. I'm thinking John Parr-lite.<br />David once fronted Push UK and works as an acclaimed vocalist in Spanish speaking territories. This album is a very soft and sweet pure British AOR release.<br />There is a few covers amongst the originals. Hands To Heaven is very familiar yet I can't recall where from (great ballad); Inside Love is a crunchier melodic rocker and I Don't Want To Wait Anymore is a cover of the Tubes' ballad.<br />In-between these are some very good songs, albeit very very laid back.<br />At 40 minutes in length, it's about just right. Any longer and it might have dragged due to the slower tempo."
631,5,"I'm no authority on Celtic music, so I can only speak from my heart. But this CD sure speaks to me; it's such a beautiful compilation of songs.  I've bought other Celtic albums and found that I was not fond of them, so I'm thankful this turned out to be such a gem.  I often play it softly when friends visit.  It creates an ambiance of calm and peacefulness."
632,5,I bought this for a Christmas gift. I am pleased and so is the person I gave it to. Enjoy!
633,5,"Our Daughter loves these CDs, it's a great way for her to learn Bible Songs.  We have some in the car and some in the house.  first heard about them when received as a gift, promptly bought a few more when we found them here."
634,5,"this cd is essential to any Juggalo collection, one of the six joker cards.(the original at that was sent to me) very pleased."
635,5,This is my absolute favorite Christmas CD! My mom always played it during the holidays when  I was little and I will continue the tradition with my kids.
636,5,"I've owned these recordings on vinyl since the 70s, and I've nearly worn them out!<br /><br />For some reason the Prokofiev concerto is not as highly regarded or recorded as often as its sibling Sinfonie-Concertante for Cello and Orchestra.  The Cello Concerto was not particularly successful at its premiere.  Years later Prokofiev reworked it into his Sinfonie-Concertante (giving equal weight to the orchestra).  Although Prokofiev obviously used much of the same lyrical melodic material in both, these two *children* are suprisingly different!  The concerto is more chromatically angular and unashamedly mischievous, while the Sinfonie-Concertante is well behaved in comparison.  This concerto is devilishly difficult, another example of Prokofiev's lack of empathy for mortal humans, requiring, like all great concerti, blurring dexterity and speed, a wide range of tonal colors, and fingering/strumming techniques.  Christine Walevska rolls up her sleeves and digs in enthusiastically, taking all the obstacles in stride.  She is very expressive in the lyric moments and very impressive through the more mechanical virtuoso passages.  Inbal and the Monte Carlo orchestra (the only recording of them I have ever seen/heard) are wonderful accompanists, following Walevska and Prokofiev on this careening journey perfectly, expertly.  Why we haven't heard them recorded in the other repertoire I'll never know.  The sound on the original Philips LP recording was always a cello demo, with great presence and realism.  I listen to this recording a lot.<br /><br />The Khatchaturian concerto makes a nice contrasting piece.  It is a more well-known, more \\""cinematic\\"" work than the Prokofiev, stylistically.  It also contains much chromatic harmony and requires great technical and sympathetic musical skills.  Here, as in the Prokofiev, Walevska soars over the score and elevates the work with her playing, seems to be completely inside the music; and the Monte Carlo Opera Orchestra again are most sympatico.  It's a justifiably famous concerto and one of the greater works by Khatchaturian.  The sound here is similarly terrific, and I give the Philips engineers great credit for making both these recordings sound so great, even back then.<br /><br />The Khatchaturian might be the more well-known concerto, but this disc is like visiting a friend and making a new, better friend in the process.sympatico.

637,4,Iliked them.  Good sound quality It got here fast as well.  (Why does my review have to be so long?
638,5,"This is, in my opinion their darkest release yet. Boys show that, while they might grew older, they haven't lost any of their anger and rebellion. Apart of the signature sound, there are hints of darker version of Underworld sound which adds nicely to a wide variety this album poses."
639,5,"I got this for a couple of huge fans of Eva Cassidy, so it was a sure hit to begin with. Definitely worth the price paid for the hard copy vinyl of a classic singer legend."
640,5,"Makes you happy listening to his music.  He can handle the standards, Christmas music, and rock equally well.  We listened to this several during the holidays."
641,5,"Product arrived super-fast, in perfect condition, and was exactly what I expected. You couldn't ask for anything more now could you?"
642,5,Bought this for my daughter and she loved it!!! Great Christmas gift!!!! Was told I was the best mom ever. Priceless!!
643,3,"The editing is a little strange, but the music seems to be there.  I think I would have liked it more if they had separated the songs and not made it all run together. This music from that year was hard to find, and the concert they have is or was amazing. The sound is good... the packaging is good, the artists are wonderful... just wish it was edited differently.<br /> Diehard fans will love it.<br /> It was worth the money spent. buy it if you like ELP."
644,5,"Susan has a voice that expresses the emotion of each song she sings. You feel her inside the music, living the songwriters message."
645,5,"Rhapsody in Blue is by far my favorite musical work. Ever. And this is by far my favorite recording/performance of it. Ever. The other pieces in the album are great, too. I smile every time I listen to it. :)"
646,5,"The product was shipped fast and was not damaged, it was new just as advertised. Very happy with my experience."
647,5,I bought this for my little cousin who just loved listening to Kenny.  Got him started at a young age.  Thank You!
648,5,i have almost all the other euge groove cd's actuall hard copies so this was necessary to add to the collection.  this is one great cd
649,4,"There are nine tracks on this album, several of which feature Middle Eastern sounds and the rest of which feature European/Celtic sounds.  To confuse things, McKennitt seeks the roots of Celtic sound through the Middle East and the Silk Road, so tunes that look like they should be Middle Eastern in sound actually have Celtic sounds to them.  Whatever the musical influences in the tunes, they are rich-sounding notes that build up stories in their lyrics and regale the ears through their hypnotic rhythms.<br /><br />There is a little booklet of liner notes included with the CD that lists out the lyrics on the album so you can follow along as McKennitt sings.  Since McKennitt's voice can be quiet at times, this booklet is a real treasure that allowed me to hear the lyrics clearly as she sang.<br /><br />If there is a theme to this collection it is \\""travel.\\"" The album bounces around in time and place, visiting a number of exotic locales through its songs.  The unusual sounds of the album richly evoke distant places and lost times, recalling Western Europe, the Middle East, and the Far East.  McKennitt's haunting voice is superb at telling stories through lyrics, and you won't go wrong as you listen in to her tales."
650,5,I got thsi more my daughter for her bday and she is loving this cd.  It has a ton of good songs and it's brought her hours of fun
651,5,A must have for any fan of the music from the Lord of the Rings trilogy of films. Recommended to all!
652,4,"Born in the Morningside Heights section of Manhattan, NY in 1937, George Denis Patrick Carlin was raised by a single mom. They didn't get along well and he often ran away from home as a boy. George trained as an Air Force radar tech while also working as a disc jockey. In 1957, he was dismissed from the service for being an \\""unproductive airman.\\""<br /><br />Two years later Carlin teamed up with Jack Burns (later of \\""Burns & Schreiber\\""). They did a stand-up act in beatnik coffeehouses and did morning drive DJing at a Hollywood, CA. radio station. In 1960, the two released a comedy LP entitled  \\""Burns and Carlin at the Playboy Club Tonight.\\"" George became a \\""single\\"" soon after. Guest spots on Jack Paar's Tonight show led to other TV appearances. Carlin's first solo album, [[ASIN:B0017RQW4S TAKE-OFFS AND PUT-ONS]] (1972) was recorded in 1966, when he still wore conservative suits and had short hair. With no cursing or drug references, this LP still indicates things to come (Al Sleet, the hippy dippy weatherman is featured).<br /><br />Issued in Nov. '74, TOLEDO WINDOW BOX (LD-3003) is George Carlin's fourth LP for LITTLE DAVID Records. It's also his fourth and final album to go gold. Taped at Oakland, CA's Paramount Theater on 7/20/74, this set deals with a few of George's favorite topics at the time: weed, religion and anomalous words and phrases.<br /><br />\\""SIDE\\"" NOTES--<br /><br />ONE -- 1.)

655,2,"Most of us are slaves \\""in Pharoah's Army\\"". An occupation is not a vocation, however lucrative it might be.  Consequently we rot. Is it not the root cause of Thoreau's maxim that \\""most men live lives of quiet desperation\\""? Even at our Walter Mitty best, we would not dream of surveying Mozart's Symphonies with the Berlin Philharmonic. And yet one wonders whether Uncle Karl Bohm, feted as he was, went to the grave as unfulfilled as any Joe Dirt. Could one suggest that he partially missed the train, vocation-wise? If destiny had been kinder, he would have been a funeral director or a latter-day Charon on the shores of the Dead Sea, ferrying tourists to the other shore?<br /><br />Evidence is readily at hand: his Mozart cycle from the Sixties. It certainly has its merits (K 22, K 110, K 129, K 132, K 134, K 181, K 338) but much of it sounds funereal - and it takes  a special sort of talent to drain the innate vitality from the Berlin Philharmonic (Giulini replicated this herculean feat in [[ASIN:B0000027JI Mozart: Symphonies Nos. 40, & 41 - Jupiter]]).<br /><br />Uncle Karl's testudinal treatment of the finale of K 183 is almost the worst conducting known to me - and in making this statement, I am fully aware of the horror that is entombed in [[ASIN:B000001G5A Mozart: Requiem]]. To be dead beyond death.<br /><br />This compilation of Mozart's last six symphonies has been around since mid-1995. It is emblematic of the wider cycle. The Haffner is defunct. The Prague - sounding ever so ordinary - is afflicted with Rigor Mortis. Not even Resurrection Day will summon this G Minor from the grave. There is some sort of pulse to the Linz Symphony even if it is fitful.  That leaves the great E Flat and the Jupiter as the sole reasons for purchasing this set unless one has a taste for the macabre.<br /><br />K 543 was recorded in the same month - February 1966 - as Uncle Karl's K 297b with the Berlin Philharmonic (and the latter is arguably his best-ever recording).  The great form (in E Flat Major) continues: this is warmhearted and wise music-making. It is an invitation to luxuriate in both the breadth of Mozart's vision and the opulence of a great orchestra at its zenith.<br /><br />The Jupiter likewise commands respect: it is spring-heeled and dramatic. Repeats are few but their omission is a blessing. The Berlin Philharmonic red-lines itself in the finale where Mozart invokes the Music of the Spheres. And yet this is not its first manifestation to the market, CD-wise. DG originally released this cycle in the late 1980s in the famous sea-green box with minimal documentation (being rarer than hen's teeth, it is not listed on Amazon). K 551 sounded ever so punchy in this earlier issue. In attempting to add more ambiance to the baseline, the Original Image Bit Processing fatally undermined its pungency.  Track down a copy of the older issue; they are readily available.<br /><br />It comes down to this: do you want to abet Uncle Karl's subliminal urge to be a mortician or would you rather listen to a Mozart who is vibrantly alive?m (in E Flat Major) continues: this is warmhearted and wise music-making.

656,5,Was as described. Ordered it for my grandaughter to play on her Karaoke machine she is getting for Christmas. I know she will love it.
657,5,KT Tunstall is a great artist and this cd is definitely one that will be on the top of my list for a while
658,5,This was a gift from me to me. I was told about Jaron and boy can he sing.If you love music try this cd.
659,3,"I love almost every one of the songs these young men record.  However, I had hoped for more traditional Italian seasonal songs. I speak only a smattering of Italian, but I can certainly appreciate fine presentations!"
660,5,his is a great live recording of the best known hits. I particularly like the ones that were used as theme songs to the CSI-shows
661,5,I have heard some of these songs on a Christian radio station and was pleased to hear many more on this CD. Good listening and great worship music!
662,5,"This is the beautiful soundtrack that accompanies Pedro Almodovar's masterpiece, 'High heels'.  Sakamoto's music is exquisite.  Plus the cover art is quite clever."
663,4,"WRONG.  To the guy who recommended Alive over this ...  I love Grant Green Alive and would recommend both ... This is better.  Get both.  Solid, spirited, no nonsense funk, well played.  Green is actually MUCH more fired up on this album -- great solid classic late 60s early 70s jazz funk."
664,5,"I love listening to this CD over & over.  Erentxun's voice is one of those scratchy, badass voices & his songs are full of passion & soul.  Definitely a great CD."
665,4,The Music is great the CD has many marks but its work in-spike of the many marking thanks we will really enjoy it at Heritage Village Kwanzaa Celebration
666,5,"awesome,just great shipped fast, why do you require nineteen words? does it help your sales any amount, as your a good company"
667,5,"These are the most incredible musicians I have heard in a very long time.  They improve on songs (regardless of style) in a way that only true artists can.  I have yet to meet someone who has a bad thing to say about their music, and I have introduced their music to all my friends.  These guys are fantastic!!"
668,5,This is a great CD. Brings back memories of the 70's. This in my opinion was the greatest music era of it's time.
669,1,I have been listeningtoAngel City since the great release Two Minute Warning and to make a long story this cd sucks. The songs are dull and the production stinks.Stay away and do not waste your money.<br />  Nuff said
670,3,"One of the classic albums of all time.  I was so excited when it came I ripped open the amazon zipper box and slid this vinyl onto my turntable. Slid the album cover into a new protective 4 mil poly cover and cranked up the sound and waited for the building gong that starts this whole experience. But - before I hear the gong, I hear \\""THUMP\\"" pause \\""THUMP\\"" pause, etc. Then the gong and the sonic beauty of this recording. The sound of the recording and the mix is best I've ever heard. the production quality of the vinyl sucks. The center hole had burrs, the label was not centered and the THUMP was obviously a pressing issue. there must be a ridge between the hole and the outside edge. The cover is pretty cool with the original release album art cleverly placed inside the gatefold cover.<br />Sadly, this one came out of it's new 4mil poly cover, taped back into the Amazon zipper box, and sent back.<br />3 stars you ask? cover art and sonic beauty are worth it. The thumps during the silent parts were too distracting. No thump, better label application, no burrs, easy 5 stars.<br />Note about Amazon: Probably the best on-line company in the world. Returning is easy and the replacement is on it's way practically instantly. Amazon prime is awesome as well.<br /><br />*****************<br /><br />Got the replacement and the same problem exists, but like a commenter noted, mostly side one tracks 1 and 2. I think I'll keep it this time since it probably exists on all of the first batch of pressings. I will be contacting the record label since the Moody Blues need to know the quality of their 45th Anniversary Limited Edition isn't up to the level they might like it to be."
671,4,"The album's great and works fine, but I was bummed to see a crack in the case. A minor issue, however this was a gift for somebody and that annoyed me."
672,4,"This is a divisive album among The Corrs' fans. Some fans saw this as a sellout album as it is more heavily pop influenced than their earlier efforts. However, there are also fans like myself that discovered The Corrs through this album and from that became a fan of their other work.<br /><br />There are several notable songs on this release, including their breakthrough hit in the US, \\""Breathless.\\"" However, fans of Talk On Corners and Forgiven, Not Forgotten may be disappointed, as this album is definitely more pop than those earlier albums.<br /><br />However, the special edition version of this album captures The Corrs sound that the original release was missing, including acoustic versions of 4 tracks from the original release, 2 tracks not available elsewhere (\\""Love In The Milky Way\\"" and \\""Looking In The Eyes Of Love\\""), and live versions of two of their earlier hits.<br /><br />Overall, this is a pretty good album. If you are considering purchasing it, please go for In Blue: Special Edition. The extra tracks are well worth it, providing a few songs that are not available elsewhere and renditions of a few songs that turn a pretty good album into a great album. Without the bonus tracks, I would knock 1 star off of this review."
673,5,Casting crowns is one of my favorite Christian bands. Their songs are sung with heartfelt emotion inspired my the heart of Jesus.
674,5,Bought this for my husband to listen to while he was a cross country truck driver.  He was completely satisfied with this product and has listened to it multiple times.
675,5,this cd brung back memories it was a good cd. No scratches or anything. Thanks for doing business with me
676,5,I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE MY BEST FRIEND HAS THE SAME NAME/DIANE GAUTHIER/SHE IS A GREAT LADY/DIANE GAUTHIER IS A GREAT NAME/PRAISE GOD!
677,5,One of my all time favorite Christmas records. Josh has created a classic here. It goes out on the stereo every December. I never get tired of it.
678,5,This is a great compilation of all her hits (so far).  This CD has a ton of songs you already love!  She is so talented.  So cool.
679,5,Chipmunks CGI movie and song.I love them very very much.I‘m sure will invite my friends to buy it!I'm looking forward to know the forth movie is coming out!
680,5,"Love GD's designs! My sister loves him so I brought it here for her B-day present. This is a good deal compare to the stores I went to. Very satisfied, my sister LOVED it. But it didnt came with a poster... I dont really care tho, the product was great :D"
681,5,"Excellent recording. Really enjoy the May Festival Chorus! I love the \\""Angel's Dance\\"" with the Pops and the fun arrangement of \\""Go tell it on the Mountain\\"" John Morris Russell is quite an asset to Cincinnati. Welcome!"
682,5,"This was purchased for my son who loves the artist, Enya!  It certainly met his expectations and he is happy to listen to her."
683,5,I bought this on a whim.... And am so glad I did. Its original and familiar at the same time.
684,5,"great album from boz,late 80's comeback with top session help from among others members of toto,marcus miller,dann huff,john robinson,mike landau,lenny castro,siedah garret,timothy b schmitt. whats number one is a cool opener with jeff porcaros drums and marcus millers slapping bass laying a heavy groove.lyrics by jim carroll and music by miller.right out of my head rocks with porcaro laying it down with dave hungate his ex toto buddy on bass,is another stormer with a bitching solo from dann huff who wrote the song with his brother david.other stanout tracks are heart of mine penned by Chicago vocalist jason scheff with bobby caldwell and dennis matkosky.a fine album with something for everyone,rock,soul,funk and boz' unique voice so distinctive.this is remastered and is more punchier than the 80,s release,i know because i  bought it in 88'.so fans of middle man will dig this for sure.the tunes are melodic and well produced .musos will love it!!"
685,1,I suppose a cheap price....<br /><br />Hard Promises<br />Southern Accents<br />Full Moon Fever<br />Into The Great Wide Open<br />Damn The Torpedoes<br /><br />That and I guess little shelf space usage.
686,5,"2 of best guitarists ever, on 2 lp collaboration. get it before it's out of print again. chet is a given legend, jerry is not just a novelty, great player, singer. buy this now! braswell"
687,5,great cd it was just what we were looking and more. our chidren even liked it.my brother borowed it.hope i get it back soon.
688,5,"I just came back from a cruise on the Celebrity Silhouette where Lisa was the cruise director (and a terrific one at that). She sang a couple of numbers which displayed her great singing talent....so upon returning home I checked her on Amazon and voila!<br /><br />This lady hits the trifecta for a singer...a gorgeous voice, the ability to give the lyrics true meaning, and musicianship in terms of phrasing and interpretation that is first class.<br /><br />The material with the exception of the two \\""standards\\"" (Nevertheless and Downtown) include numerous lesser known songs from the Broadway and Off-Broadway stage,,,,a nice way to be introduced to some new and interesting material(at least to my virgin ears).<br /><br />This CD demonstrates, once again, how much enormous talent there is out there that does not, in the long run, get it's due.<br /><br />Get this CD and enjoy!"
689,4,"If you enjoy listening to flute,oboe and guitar playing some 56 minutes of Quantz, Telemann, Bach,Vivaldi Villa-Lobos, you will get considerable enjoyment from this CD. The players perform very well together. The recording itself is quite good, having been recorded at Studio B and at Berklee College of Music. An arresting cover Collage by Thomas Grabosky give the CD  a sense of era and content. All in all, very nice."
690,5,This is a real country girl.  I don't think she has ever made a song that I didn't like.  I'm from the country and she reminds me of all the girls backhome
691,4,"I have to agree with the others who lamented the lack of the famous \\""long\\"" version of \\""Time Has Come Today.\\"" Instead, we are offered a single edit of that song, along with \\""single version one\\"" of the same song. Odd decision by the compilers of this compilation. Otherwise, this is an excellent ear-opening bunch of songs, a good introduction to a VERY influential band that still don't get the props they deserve. As producer David Rubinson says in the detailed liner notes: \\""They were the most unique black group I'd ever seen. People look at Sly and Jimi Hendrix and forget that the Chambers Brothers came first.\\"" Indeed, these guys were seemingly ahead of their time, daring to break out of the limits of genre and race. The music on here --- recorded from 1966-1970 --- is a delightful blend of rock, pop, soul, gospel, and even hints of folk and jazz. The music is a mix of originals (in addition to \\""Time Has Come Today\\"" one of their more incredible original songs is \\""New Generation\\"") and covers of songs like \\""People Get Ready\\"", \\""Uptown\\"" and a 10-minute workout on \\""Wade in the Water.\\"" Maybe not a perfect collection for fans that grew up with this band, but for relative newcomers like me, this is a very impressive set. Plus, it sellf for a good price and you get over an hour of music."
692,5,"Australia's own Little River Band. I simply love everything the band ever did from their first self titled release in 1975 through to \\""Get Lucky\\"" in 1990. This album is a personal favourite marking Glenn Shorrock's much welcomed return to the band after the wonderful John Farnham years. This line up was tight ... really tight. They performed a full concert at World Expo 1988 in Brisbane at the time \\""Monsoon\\"" was released and it was a truly sensational event. I recorded the simulcast on cassette and still treasure it. Glenn Frey of The Eagles joined them on stage that night for a few Eagles songs and just jammed on ... what a night ! Lyin Eyes/Take It Easy from that concert is on the \\""Reminiscing\\"" compilation of LRB's but nothing else from the concert has ever seen the light of day unfortunately. It would be great if it could be sourced, digitally remastered and released but lets not hold our breath. If you love LRB and haven't heard this album yet, please do yourself a huge favour. MONSOON truly is Essential LRB."
693,5,"Purchased this CD because I love this artist. The clarity of voice, the instruments, the music, absolutely &#34;LOVE&#34; it. The price was reasonable, the product arrived on time, I am very pleased with the purchase. It seems only Amazon specializes with the 'older artists', and the availability of finding thier product online. Very satisfied with my purchase, and I highly recommend it to others."
694,5,"I've been waiting a long time for this item to be at a low enough price to buy and it  finally happened! My item was poorly taken care of. The booklet was all stuck together and the CD had some songs that skipped, but it was still worth it. A rare item at a good price. The booklet has some photos in it not in the standard release. Well worth the money."
695,2,Great album for die hard fans.  It seemed like album was done as an after thought and the sound quality is not fine tuned.  The songs did not gel well.  I don't need to hear Paul Bryom two years after leaving Celtic Thunder.
696,5,Good and entertaining music. This guy is the composer of &#34;Ghost Busters&#34;. Very talented & I am a  musician all my life so I enjoyed it.
697,4,What´s the different between RAY CONDO & other Rock-A-Billy bands???<br />The canadian create his own marvellous style!It´s no typical Country or Rock&Roll.<br />Taste a Song from Ray Condo´s Sound - you love it or you leave it!
698,3,"The CD itself was excellent..<br />But the cover was damaged - and bonded very tightly, so I had problems opening it :-)<br />But besides that, the quality was excellent!"
699,5,"if you like hood music, then this is a buy for you. Khia is reppin philly to the fullest. i heard a track on this album and had to check it out. when i saw that DJ Scream mixed her music, i knew it was going to be good. i have several of DJ Scream's mix tapes from the south."
700,5,"Right from the first song, you can tell that this album is going to be great.  Christopher Bowder is masterful.  Check out \\""Dig Up the Dead\\"" and \\""Call Me When It's Over.\\""<br /><br />Similar artists: Manchester Orchestra, Brand New"
701,5,I honestly can type that I think this is a perfect electronic music recording.  I absolutely loved it the first time I heard it.  The structure is tour-de-force and I cannot think of any electronica that I have ever heard that is any better than this.  Worth a purchase.  I'm getting the cd cause I loved the download so much.  I read about this album on Ghostly's Favorite Albums of the Decade.
702,5,talk about songs  that just  stand the test of time?  and  the Miracles  are one of the most important  groups  ever.  Smokey Robinson is one of the most important and influential songwriters  ever.  these songs speak  to everyday life and situations.  the music and the vocals  just hit home and speak to the soul and the mind. these songs take you back and also stay modern in feel.
703,4,I originally bought it because of a couple of hard to find songs. After I started listening to it  I found I remembered a good number of the songs. Love the entire collection and would recommend it to any one who enjoys that period of music
704,1,Received discs and started playing and on both there were scratches or something that caused the disc to skip and repeat.
705,5,After listening to Tony Bennett's Duets CD it became impossible not to try Duets II even though I doubted he could improve on it; my doubts were completely unjustified:  Lady Gaga's The Lady is a Tramp and Amy Winehouse with Body and Soul would make this CD a bargain at twice Amazon's price.  Fifteen more great artists and song make four times would still be a steal!
706,5,"I am a classically trained singer/songwriter, and while I love music from many different genres, I am picky about the quality of music I will tolerate listening to on a regular basis. I remember the kids music from my youth (I am 32 at the time of writing this review), and I was so pleasantly surprised to find such a wonderful improvement over the old 80's kids music in Susie Tallman's offerings. She has a lovely voice, and can easily switch from classical to more of a fun, folk song singing style.<br /><br />My husband and I have been thrilled with the songs on this CD, and better yet, it is one of our 20 month old son's favorite CDs! He loves listening to these songs, and if he is fussy or just needs a little something to listen to while driving, eating, or just playing with his toys, this really gets him quiet and thoughtful. I can tell he really listens!<br /><br />Thank you Susie Tallman for providing such a great collection of well sung/played songs for all of us families to enjoy!<br /><br />Love and light,<br />Anna Maria"
707,4,"I thought with K25 and Kylie's big 25th Anniversary, that this would have some cool new re-interpreted versions of some great hits, but nope! It's just another greatest Hits Compilation. Not much added since Ultimate Kylie, and the only reason to have it is for the DVD, IMHO! However, it's a great item for an intro to Kylie or for a Completist's Collection."
708,5,Saw this in the 80's and loved it. Found the DVD for a few pennies and ordered. Totally enjoyed. I alsways enjoy when the libretto is encluded with the CD. Many fast paced songs. As I grew up with the Viet Bam was and married a vet this meant more to me than maybe someone else without ties to that time but music is music. Well done. They get an A+ for this one.
709,5,"As usual Dj Khaled pulls off a startling piece.<br />Great choice of collaborations, the worlds biggest and rugged in current  Hip Hop like: Rick Ross, Meek Mill, Nas, Scarface, Ace Hood, Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj, Birdman, Plies, Chris Brown, and Jamaica's Dancehall Kind Mavado.<br />This is indeed a Must Have!!  DJ Khaled sound is like no other!!"
710,5,my favorite group<br />this music will never be old<br />it is the same time history and modern<br />the voice of Forgerty amazing
711,5,"This record is one of the seminal recordings of the late '60s featuring legends Mike Bloomfield, Al Kooper, and Stephen Stills, along with nearly as legendary bassist Harvey Brooks and drummer Eddie Hoh, on the record that started the whole \\""jam session record\\"" craze. Often imitated but never equaled the record catches Bloomfield at the peak of his powers. Barely remembered now, Bloomfield was at the time recognized as the greatest of the young, white practitioners of blues guitar, easily the equal of the UK's Eric Clapton.<br /><br />If you love blues guitar and you've never heard this record you owe it to yourself to check it out.<br /><br />If you have heard it you know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />Oh, and the Steve Stills stuff on it ain't bad, either."
712,4,"The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because they have so many damn epic albums!! Overkill is a true metal giant that still releases high quality albums unlike other more popular bands with the money. I think there are four of them? Anyway! This album punches you in the face, then curb stomps your skull into the pavement as you cry in an overwhelming amount of joy just because you heard this album! Ironbound is one of the greatest metal albums in modern times. Bobby Blitz sounds great, a little deeper, but still great. Guitars?? Shred as always!! The beat is always fast and energetic. Buy this album and you wont be sorry I can promise you that. Overall, a great metal album! In my top 5 albums of Overkill hands down."
713,5,"Vampyros Lesbos Sexadelic Dance Party is one hour and eleven seconds and was re - released on January 27, 2009. The original album only had twelve tracks and with this one it is a collection of three soundtracks: Vampyros Lesbos, She Kills in Ecstasy, and The Devil Came from Akasava. The music is in the style of Psychedelic Pop, Acid Jazz - Pop, Cocktail, and Indie Rock. This is a total 180 from the music that I listen to. Vampyros Lesbos Sexadelic Dance Party is great if you like psychedelic and sound track music on the same album.

714,5,"Released in 1973 (possibly the best year ever for rock & roll music!), this album features hits like \\""Long Train Running\\"", \\""China Grove\\"" and \\""Without You\\"", all Doobie Classics but there is not a weak song on this entire album....Other rockers include \\""Natural Thing\\"", \\""Evil Woman\\"" and the title track \\""The Captain and Me\\"". But, like no other, The Doobies can also slow it down and make impressive ballads with incredible musicianship and insightful lyrics with songs like \\""South City Midnight Lady\\"" and \\""Dark Eyed Cajun Woman\\"", two of their best songs ever. \\""South City Midnight Lady\\"" also featured incredible pedal steel guitar work from Steely Dan's Jeff \\""Skunk\\"" Baxter, who later joined the Doobie Brothers. Little Feat's Billy Payne is also playing on this album. This was the apex of the Tom Johnston led Doobie Brothers before his health declined due to typical rock & roll partying. Patrick Simmons, the 2nd guitar to Tom Johnson, was an unheralded superstar in his own right in both guitar work, songwriting and vocals. Although considered hard-rockers, this album showed the many true sides of the Doobie Brothers and their incredible mix of country, r&b, jazz, bluegrass and road-house boogie that shot them to the top of rock & roll history during the 70's. I have them Top 5 all time best rock bands!"
715,5,"Growing up in the '90s, I've always been familiar with the Pumpkins. However, I began listening to them very consistently this last year and they quickly became one of my favorite bands. Their first three albums are quite brilliant, especially for the time they were released. Though Billy Corgan was ahead of his time and created music quite unlike anything else, there remains a divide among Pumpkins fans with some feeling that Billy is a musical tyrant who wronged the other band members- D'arcy, James, and Jimmy by continuing to perform with the name \\""Smashing Pumpkins\\"" in their absence. Yes, I liked the old line up, but what some fans don't seem to realize is that BILLY CORGAN IS THE SMASHING PUMPKINS! He wrote all the band's music and is responsible for their unique sound. James and D'arcy were good, but Billy could play guitar and bass better than both of them. In fact, Billy had to play and record all the bass and guitar parts on Gish and Siamese Dream- because he was that much better and could do it much faster than the others. I'll say that Jimmy is a hell of a drummer, but without Corgan, The Smashing Pumpkins would simply not be The Smashing Pumpkins.<br /><br />The recording of Oceania was a band effort, and Billy wrote all the music again. However, this album signals a return to the Pumpkins initial sound, without sounding like a rip off of their previous successes. I would say that if you like the psychedelic and sonic atmospheric landscapes found in Gish and Siamese Dream, Oceania is definitely for you. Upon first listen, I noted Oceania has all the classic characteristics of a Pumpkin album- layered guitars with sonic depth, beautiful string arrangements, and melodic guitar riffs that synch so well with the dreamy atmosphere only the Pumpkins can create. Billy claims that this is his best effort since 1995's Mellon Collie, and I fully agree with that statement.<br /><br />I really enjoy all the songs, but here are a few highlights from Oceania. \\""Quasar\\""is the opening track and it's a heavy-rocking shoegaze tune that provides a great starting point for the album. The second song, \\""Panopticon,\\"" has a killer guitar riff with pounding drums in the background. The next few songs such as \\""The Celestials\\"" and \\""Violet Rays\\"" are slower melodies, but are still great songs. One song that really stands out is \\""Pinwheels,\\"" which begins with a synth intro that is remniscient of the Adore sound, but much more uplifting and also has some acoustic guitar. \\""Oceania\\"" is a somewhat mellow, progressive masterpiece. \\""The Chimera\\"" is a hard rock song that reminds me of the sound from Siamese Dream. The album finishes on a softer note, with the song \\""Wildflower.\\"" Altogther, this album is a must buy for any Pumpkin fan. Billy Corgan has proved to everyone he still has it, and hopefully, Oceania gets the attention it deserves. In closing, Oceania can stand on its own and should not be compared to the masterpieces of Gish, Siamese Dream, or Mellon Collie, but appreciated for what it is- a sign that Bily Corgan has- and is still fully capable of producing beautiful, unique music."
716,5,"Just when I thought that Conor Oberst surely could not produce anything better than he already has, he blew me away once again.  This album is deep, thought-provoking, and hauntingly beautiful.  I would think it to be impossible for someone to listen to this album the entire way through without feeling it has deeply touched them in some way."
717,4,"The Flower Kings' latest album, BANKS OF EDEN, is more of what you would expect from the Swedish progressive rock band. The instrumentation here is fantastic; guitars are soaring, the vocals and harmonies work well together, the drums are pounding (but never overbearing), and the bass holds it all together. For all its potential though, this album sounds familiar -- too familiar perhaps. One of the hallmarks of prog is the forward-thinking nature of its music. Here, the Flower Kings look to the past, rather than the future. This album feels as if it could have easily been released 30 years ago. This might be progressive rock, but there's not much forward-thinking about it.<br /><br />\\""Numbers\\"" is a sprawling 25+ minute track. It is littered with great lead guitar, time changes, timbre shifts, and song-within-songs. It contains some of the best moments on the album. The remained of the album (6 more tracks) are standalone songs that feature the Eric Johnson-like lead guitar, the manic drumming (the band picked up a young, new drummer for this album), and lyrics based in spirituality. \\""For the Love of Gold\\"" sounds like a solid Yes song, with its refrain interjected between cymbal crashes. The closer, \\""Going Up,\\"" is an uplifting song that works great as an outro to the album. The lead guitar of Roine Stolt is more expressive than his voice, so it is only fitting that his solo brings BANKS OF EDEN to a close.<br /><br />Fans of the Flower Kings will enjoy BANKS OF EDEN -- it's a solid album by the band and one of the better ones in recent years. Fans of Yes, early King Crimson, and early Porcupine Tree will find something here to enjoy. Again, it's not a bad album, there's just nothing that elevates it against its peers. BANKS OF EDEN is good in the moment, but it isn't strong enough to create any real lasting appeal. The execution of Flower Kings can't be argued; I'd just like to see a bit more individuality."
718,5,"I really like the music by Fred Hammond. I have several of his cd's. I heard a preview of this one, and was not sure I wanted to purchase this one. I would have missed out on some great music. The preview does not do this cd justice, I LOVE THIS CD!!! The title threw me off a little, but because I like his music already I decided to get it. Glad I made the decision to buy it. Not disappointed."
719,5,"I always think my reviews are so important, so priceless.(well, I'm a fool, but an honest one..)Aren't you all so lucky? Having made my sad admission, I'll grace you all with the definitive review of \\""Around The Next Dream.\\"" If any of these three men could make a better recording I haven't heard it. If anyone besides any of these three could make a better blues record, I haven't heard that either. I don't believe a better blues guitarist ever lived than Gary Moore. He tops my short list, and until I heard this record I would have placed him behind Joe B. and Peter G. If you love electric blues, you need this record. Listen to it, and if you think I'm all wet, put me on your list of reviewers to ignore in the future. I only wish Gary was still around so I could tell him what a great job he did on this. I'd never tell him to make more records, because he might have trouble topping this one. To Jack and Ginger,\\""See mates you never needed Crapdock in the first place! Just let him run around doing his beloved entertainer routine.\\"" I like to envision Gary with the angels' wings, but not to worry. If you played on this record, you'll have yours by and by."
720,5,"I've been a Soundgarden and Audioslave fan for many years.  But, for whatever reason, I'd never gotten around to purchasing any of Chris Cornell's solo music.  Not really sure why, just never did.<br /><br />Well, the other day, while flipping through the options on XM, I stumbled upon Cornell's live acoustic version of \\""Like a Stone\\"".  I was floored.  It literally stopped me in my tracks and gave me chills.  (It's been a LONG time since that has happened... maybe Jeff Buckley, back when \\""Grace\\"" was released....?)<br /><br />Needless to say, I immediately purchased the \\""Songbook\\"" CD, and I have to tell you:  EVERY single song on it is amazing.  He covers Led Zeppelin's \\""Thank You\\"" with such emotion; really intensely beautiful.  And \\""Doesn't Remind Me\\""... a simple little melody... but, as with all his music, his haunting voice gives it such depth.<br /><br />I always loved his voice when he was with Soundgarden and Audioslave... but on this CD, his profound talent goes to a WHOLE new level.  His voice is powerful, gentle and soulful, all at the same time.  I just can't get ENOUGH of his music, and find myself wishing \\""Songbook\\"" was a double CD.<br /><br />I'm hoping a live concert DVD will be released next.<br />AND I'm ALSO hoping he'll come back to play Atlanta again soon.<br />I'll be there."
721,5,This cd is great for relaxing.It arrived when promised and in great shape.Working with amazon is a terrifc experience.I would recommend this cd to everyone.
722,5,"As always, Fernando uses the gifts that God has given him. Beautiful and meaningful. I recommend him to all that appreciate the simple and the reverent."
723,4,"Ken Golden's Laser's Edge Records' most accessible band has created another melodic beauty. The opening track is \\""killer,\\"" pun intended, and the entire CD is strong. I have gotten used to the ballad and female addition on this number. Despite their lead singer's change in hair style from a conservative short dark look to a Sammy Hagar thing, the band has not sold-out and everyones stage performance remains firmly entrenched in all that makes this neo prog genre so enjoyable. Keep up the fine work."
724,5,"This album is simply a must have for people into female vocalists.<br /><br />years after it was released and hundreds of listens later one thing that continues to amaze me about this album is the production, i have looked into the crew who made the album just on the strength of this recording 'Let It die' (2005).<br /><br />The sparse percussion, the occasional hand claps, the occasional soft shaker, the nylon string guitar, the odd little upright piano melody, the little tickles of colour and tone....this album has it all within the production, but that is NOT to overshadow her richly wonderful voice which has it all, sexy, emotional, fluent, free, unique......as one other reviwer said, she has the sort of voice you hear once and will never forget.<br /><br />I first heard her voice on a Kings Of Convienence album, she sang on the final track of that album 'Riot On an Empty street' (also a good album)<br /><br />Feist has a ahuntingly beautiful voice and it is no wonder that 'let It Die' is so popular, it is a brilliant album.<br /><br />get it!"
725,5,"Im glad to have finally listen to this cd its a true gem. As i mentioned in one of my reviews I am relatively new to the Prog rock genre.<br />I started out nearly 3 years ago with the greats yes,genesis,spocksbeard etc. Actually I was a fan of prog early on, let me explain. Most<br />people who listen to mainstream music are fans of Yes and Genesis to a degree. However like me at one point they dont associate those bands<br />and the Hit songs with prog rock yet alone understand what progressive rock is. Once I found out that prog meant bands like genesis and pinkfloyd<br />I immediatly started to explore other prog bands and i bacame a fan of the genre in a short time. Mars Hollow's music is in my opinon is just<br />as good as some of the for mentioned bands they just need to improve there production quality but i guess to do that they might need a more expensive studio, but this Cd is symphonic rock at its best and i strongly recommend it, especially if you enjoy  music that is complex and carefully arranged. 5 stars"
726,5,"Good music. I'm thinking I'll \\""grow into it\\"" because right now the rhythms are a bit difficult for me to dance with...but I like it."
727,5,"Fabulous. Thank Holy God for continuing to send us artists indspired by the shocking, hypnotic brillianace of God and the wisdom of the Great Christ. Beautiful young man. Must buy, must own, must listen to - and to be played loud. Transformative. If you're not moved, don't bother. More of you, good Norwegian, forever.  Phoenix Chorale does a perfect job. Snobs abaho! Viva los Phoenix!"
728,5,"I love this version of It`s About Time. The dvd side have amazing videos, and the songs are great. My favorites are Don`t Tell Anyone, Hey We`re Gonna Be Alright, and Dear God."
729,5,"3rd from the Sun is perhaps Chrome's finest hour, though admittedly it's hard to argue with such incendiary masterpieces the group produced in the late 70's, including Alien Soundtracks and Half-Machine Lip Moves. TFTS would turn out to be Helios Creed's final album with the group, but he certainly went out in a blaze of glory, giving perhaps his best performance as axe murderer supreme on the seven songs (plus two bonus tracks) that comprise this CD. The appropriately titled \\""Firebomb\\"" instantly thrusts you into Chrome's mutated deviant universe with Creed's incredible guitar mayhem, the Stench brothers' industrialized nuclear drive rhythm section, and of course nominal leader Damon Edge's sci-fried surrealist lyrics of tyranny, mutation and psychosexual apocalypse. Creed's indescribably brutal guitar work on \\""Firebomb\\"" climaxes halfway through with one of the most chaotic, twisted solos ever waxed to vinyl or burned to CD--like the sonic equivalent to biting down on a piece of tinfoil. The driving \\""Future Ghosts\\"" is quintessential Chrome: mechanized drum & bass chemistry, Edge's manic Iggy-influenced howl, and Creed's chainsaw guitar pyrotechnics. \\""Armageddon,\\"" with its chilling nuclear holocaust lyrics and thunderous Creed guitar riff simply annhilates everything in its path. It's like a heat-seeking missle on a suicide mission. \\""Heart Beat\\"" features Edge's gritty, malevolent wail of repressed sexual frenzy on top of Creed's full metal jacket guitar assault and the massive, nearly monolithic drumming of John Stench. The title track as well as the creepy, crepuscular \\""Shadows of a Thousand Years\\"" continue the firestorm in progress with towering infernos of power chords, eerie off-kilter vocals (courtesy of both Edge and his then consort Fabienne Shine), and explosive electronic bursts from Edge's Moog synthesizers. The two bonus tracks (also available on the Chrome Box set) are very much at home on TFTS with their assault & battery guitar attack and Edge's doom and gloom lyrics. In retrospect, 3rd from the Sun is a grim commentary on the inevitable future of the inhuman race, and a terrifying prelude to the nuclear storm on the horizon.d gloom lyrics. In retrospect, 3rd from the Sun is a grim commentary on the inevitable future of the inhuman race, and a terrifying prelude to the nuclear storm on the horizon."
730,3,Nice music to play for a wide variety of people but not much to get anybody to excited about. I would not recommend this album for someone looking to be inspired or get up for.
731,5,"I have to be in a certain mood to listen to Andrew's music as I am with most music but when I am in that mood, I thoroughly enjoy his music and am thankful that I have had the priviledge of coming across his creations. Love is a Good Thing is one of my Favs."
732,5,"One of the best rock groups to come our in a long time.They have an awesome sound, vocals are over the top.This group is better live than recorded, you can't say that about to many bands but these guys can pull it off."
733,5,I loved the CD but I loved the DVD even more!!! I showed it to family and friends. They enjoyed it very much!!! I just wished Danny Boy was on it!!! Elaine Gianino  Thank you Amazon!!!
734,5,This is one of the best CD's I have listened to lately.  Awesome that some of my favorite artists combined to put out such fantastic music.  This one is a must have!
735,3,"This CD had a good mix of highlights, but I was a little disappointed the way the soprano attacked some of her arias."
736,4,"Overall the project is great and will have a place in music collections of longtime fans and new ones alike. Phoenix Mass Choir has some cuts that will surely become radio standards and have churches singing to the rafters. The slow tempo church revamp of \\""Tell Him What You Want\\"" is soul stirring and one of those churchy grooves you just cant' resist.  Taking it uptempo is the rousing \\""Lord Have it Your Way\\""; it will have your foot stomping and your hands clapping almost instantly. One final standout cut is the praise and worship anthem, \\""God Of  Wonders\\""  Add any of these and you will truly be blessed."
737,5,"North is a 2005 Naive classique recording starring accentus under the direction of Eric Ericson. On this recording accentus take on Scandinavian composers such as Sibelius, Stenhammar and Alfv&eacute;n to mention a few. Music notes and lyrics are available in English. Being a fellow Scandinavian I must say that accentus does an incredible job. Well done indeed. Highly recommended. 5/5."
738,4,This is definately the set to get if you want a Hits Collection of The Four Seasons & Frankie Valli's solo hits. I wish there were more footage on the DVD.
739,5,"One of the endearing things that came from the folk era was that groups like the Limeliters and Peter, Paul and Mary were interested in educating the children.  While teaching life lessons, their songs are fun for both children and adults.  The children participation songs are fun to listen to and the Limeliters candid reactions are wonderful."
740,4,"I made this disc in 2004, as a fundraising effort for a church startup I was working for at the time. It consists of original songs I had written for use in church, both worship songs and \\""special music\\"" songs. The sound is a bit on the 70's side, as it was aimed at a wide range of ages and outlooks. The songs themselves, I believe, hold up well for listening and contemplation. My favorite remains As You Walked, a reflection on Jesus' walk to the cross. Frank Sargent plays a very nice solo on that one and some others. He used a Fender strat through a Rat pedal (there's some 70's for you) set at very low distortion, achieving a nice sustained and ringing tone. The recording was put together with Cakewalk, with some importation of material recorded with other devices. I'm surprised to see it here, but we sold out the entire run.  If you buy it and enjoy it, check out my novel The Place to Be on Kindle or Nook, or listen to my newer material on YouTube by searching for kdhymes."
741,5,i bought this cd from somewhere else i love da music on it and it had other songz i didnt have so great cd to me
742,1,"What a load of ....  This has got to be the worst cd I have ever heard.  I was looking for some new classical music to listen in the car.  This was so bad I could even get through the disc twice.  The music is so slow.  I can't play the piano but I could learn this whole cd in a month.  Some songs I could play with one hand.  It is just utterly boring.  Awful.  Really, really awful."
743,5,"I loved the music in this movie and finally bought the soundtrack. I was happy with the soundtrack, and enjoy listening to it when I need some motivating music."
744,1,"With three fantastic albums under their belt, and no radio play, the music industry was dying for a top hit. Somewhere along the way the band absolutely crumbled under the industries pressure and produced an absolute flop.<br />It was not worth the vinal they put it on, much less the CD's that later followed.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, do not buy this album! But by all means, do yourself a bigger favor and buy their first three."
745,5,"This great little CD has EVERYTHING going for it. beautiful, east to listen to, you do not want this CD to end.  The Rose, Evergreen, Greensleeves, Amazing Grace.<br />All time favorites, played to perfection.  Again, Thank you Steve Hall."
746,5,I would gladly pay for this album twice.<br />My only complaint is that I can't find PowerGlove's two other albums Total Pwnage and Metal Kombat for the Mortal Man; so I can give PowerGlove money for them.
747,5,"Peroux,Gardot,Russell {not exclusively as whole cd is great}  really set the standard; good listening music from group of todays artists...Krall is superb {never a mistake when it comes to her recordings}...this cd gives a great crossection of styles....I have found from this listening several new artists to my liking...& researched for more music by them..you cannot go wrong by this if you love music of the 'old school'....they will all be played for many years"
748,5,"A classic hardcore treasure never to be duplicated again.  I thought I had ordered a c.d., so when the 7 inch arrived I had to order a turntable and relive vinyl once again.  Not such a bad thing.  Negative Approach got left out because they are from Detroit but look its never to late to finish the puzzle with this piece.  If you like Agnostic Front's \\""Victim in Pain\\"", then you have found something very close to those lines.  You will never know if you leave these guys out of your hardcore collection.  Quality holds up as this is ten songs on a 7 inch.  Goes well with Keith Morris's (Circle Jerks) new band OFF!."
749,5,"Bought this on vinyl as a kid back in early 80's and wore it out. Happy to have found this on amazon at a very fair price. Sound is great on cd and I can't wear this one out. Great exams of 80's synth music that in my opinion, this first album did not get the credit it should have gotten."
750,2,"Julian is a favorite of mine but I feel that this album has an obsession for Love. Although well done, music is basically the same one after another with no upbeat tracks without Love. You will hear this music at your favorite big box store on the overhead speakers and Julian will collect his royalties."
751,4,"The track listing for this CD is as follows:  1.  At The Hop - Danny & The Juniors  2.  Rock & Roll Music - Chuck Berry  3.  Splish Splash - Bobby Darin  4.

753,5,"Once again, Lightning Love has done it.  Their first CD was simply stunning while using a minimal amount of instruments.  This does the same quite nicely.  Thanks for the great music guys!"
754,3,"I love Bank's song with Jimmy Buffett, \\""Still In Paradise\\"" but it seems that was the only song he did that was awesome. I was a little disappointed with this CD of his.   I guess since this CD was imported into the U.S. it took quite some time getting to me. I had forgotten all about it.  Other than that plays well, no problems there."
755,1,"When you polish a turd it's still a turd.  As one reviewer said it sounds like plastic.  The singers voice sounds like a chipmunk getting strangled.....just forced radio, talentless trash."
756,5,"I'm consistently blown away by Durrett's musicianship and her adept delivery. I adore all her works, but this one ranks as my favorite. Listen after listen, 'The Mezzanine' never grows boring and it never fails to dig into my middle and move me. I'm amazed at how few people are familiar with this nimble and amazing singer-songwriter. Catch one of her live sets if you can, but if you cannot, download and take in every last piece of her music you can wrap your grubby ear canals around."
757,4,"Talking Heads / Little Creature:  This album came out after the great \\""Stop Making Sense\\"" Movie was made and, having the DVD, I really didn't feel I needed any of the albums except this one, which has some great tracks.  This is a good album that is very entertaining.  Four Stars."
758,5,"When these two ensembles joined forces--whew! Fantastic. Great performance of the Bernstein, unbelievably fast. Some of the best playing I've ever heard, virtuosos all!"
759,5,"OK, ONE REASON I LOVE THIS COLLECTION IS BECAUSE THE SONGS ARE THE FULL LP VERSIONS.IN FACT EVEN ON THE LATEST REMASTER OF *ELO II* YOU DON'T GET THE FULL U.S. VERSION OF *ROLL OVER BEETHOVEN*. HOWEVER I DO UNDERSTAND THAT THE NEWER REMASTERS ARE FROM THE U.K. ORIGINALS AND THE U.K. VERSION OF *ROLL OVER BEETHOVEN* WAS A LITTLE SHORTER THEN THE U.S. ANYWAY, I THINK THIS WAS ABOUT THE CD COLLECTION OF ELO TO BE ONLY ON 2 CD'S  P.S. SORRY FOR ALL THE CAP'S DUE TO POOR EYE'S AND   POOR TYPING SKILL'S"
760,5,"I thought I had purchased all of Johnny Bellar's CD's, but in a conversation with Johnny I found out that this CD was a release early in his recording career.  He said he thought it was still available on Amazon, and he was right.  It is a terrific CD with Johnny doing vocals on ssome of the tracks.  A very worthwhile addition to your Johnny B and/or resophonic guitar music collection."
761,5,Great CD - all the songs we love were there. Toby Keith has an excellent voice and the songs bring back loads of good memories.
762,4,"Save three dollars by buying the standard edition of the CD.  The added CD in the \\""deluxe\\"" edition is Florence's clunkers and near-clunkers.  I loved the standard CD and played it six times.  I almost lost my dinner when I played the extra CD in the \\""deluxe\\"" edition. For completists only."
763,3,"John Lee Hooker / In Person (VeeJay Records): This is NOT a live album.  This is not one of Hooker's best studio albums either, it is not bad... it's just not very memorable.  This one is Just OK.  Three Stars."
764,5,Fantastic as always. I love anything done by John Tesh. His music is awesome! And this CD is equally as good....
765,5,"Came in good condition! :) Includes Smile and What The Hell (Bimbo Jones Remix). Pretty cheap too, def worth buying!"
766,5,Eva Cassidy Songbird to me is her best! Her voice range is just wonderful and her music is very pleasant. I love listening to her as I travel and do my daily routine. I never become tired of her songs. Never!
767,1,"\\""You're not very good at catching mice, are you?\\"" Ernst Hogwood Blofeld, the head of SPECTRE (Sinister Period-Practice Enacted to Counter Traditional Readings Everlastingly) snarled at Mister Bigglesworth as he sat gloomily at his desk. \\""Listen - there they are again! The buggers must be in the floor below us. Now I know what caused last week's blackout. Perhaps we should move to another hollowed out volcano!\\""<br /><br />Mister Bigglesworth was too busy sharpening his claws on a Louis XV divan to pay much attention to this latest complaint.<br /><br />\\""And it's not only mice: for the last few days I've been hearing cat-wauling, followed by some flatulence that shook the foundations! I've told those morons in the cafeteria to improve the food; they're still serving up your cousins in gravy with chips on the side!\\""<br /><br />\\""But Number One - that was me! I've been downstairs in the studio remastering my performances of Mozart's Prague and Jupiter symphonies.\\""<br /><br />Ernst Hogwood-Blofeld looked up to see that Number 5 - Rene Jacobs - had sauntered into his office uninvited and was now sitting dumpily in one of the famous leather-seats opposite his desk.<br /><br />\\""I don't remember hearing a knock on the door!\\"" the head of SPECTRE growled.<br /><br />\\""Sorry about that Number One,\\"" Jacobs squeaked in his high-pitched voice. \\""I'm just so excited about this latest project. Those recordings are the most subversive thing I've ever done to advance our cause.\\""<br /><br />\\""So those mice I've been hearing - they're actually the scrawny, anaemic strings of the Freiburg Baroque Orchestra?\\""<br /><br />\\""That's correct. You probably heard them in the slow introduction to the Prague at 2'06\\"" or at 8'17\\"" in the development - squeak, squeak, squeak. They are also at their most puny in the six part phrase that ends the exposition in the slow movement of the Prague.  Their rodent-like contributions to the slow movement of the Jupiter are a hoot (7'09\\"" et alia). The cacophony that erupts at 7'32\\"" soon afterwards is a real treat.\\""<br /><br />\\""That must have been the flatulence I heard!\\""<br /><br />Jacobs nodded his head.<br /><br />\\""That's correct, Number One. Such is the lack of projection by the violins, they actually get monstered whenever the woodwind pipe up. And oh, what joy - I repeat developments; that makes the first movement of the Prague some sixteen minutes long. It'll be a `Dead before Dawn' experience for any listener who prefers those old dinosaurs such as Szell, Karajan or Bernstein.\\""<br /><br />Jacobs' bullet-proof glasses were becoming fogged up from the excitement. He quickly wiped them.<br /><br />\\""Following your glorious lead, Number One, clipped phrasing impairs the music-making from the first bar to the last. I have also transformed the Menuetto in the Jupiter into a Scherzo. Its finale is also zippy and lightweight. Happily for our cause, the Freiburgers are unable to impart any sort of adrenaline to the movement other than mere pace. There is at least one blunder on their part (5'46\\""). We used a bottle-top banger throughout as a continuo (just listen to 11'24\\""). All gods are dead!\\""<br /><br />The former counter-tenor gulped in excitement before continuing.<br /><br />\\""Critics are going to say that I have no ear for orchestral balance based on the slow movement of the Prague (0'50\\"") and its counterpart in the Jupiter (1'12\\"") where I try to recreate the soundtrack to Jaws with the double-basses. Who cares what they say! More widely, thank god for timpani and brass - their thunderous impact masks not only the feebleness of the strings but also my complete lack of an interpretive position. If listeners want to get sucked in by their prominence, so much the better for our cause!\\""<br /><br />Jacobs drew a deep breath.<br /><br />\\""Number One, it's no time for undue modesty. These are the most vinegary, underpowered, underwhelming performances of these masterpieces in history. It is a repeat of my triumph with La Clemenza di Tito which likewise eclipsed the previous HIP recordings of this work.\\""<br /><br />\\""Do you really think so?\\"" Hogwood-Blofeld asked mildly as his right-hand disappeared from view.<br /><br />\\""Yep, I have miniaturised Mozart to the point where even Tom Thumb would not recognise him.

His boss was feverishly trying to push a certain button under the desk.<br /><br />\\""But what am I saying!\\"" he screeched. \\""Your own recordings of these symphonies, Number One, and your bloodless rendition of La Clemenza di Tito continue to irradiate the market.

768,5,"The Art of the Fugue is a sublime piece of music that reveals something new about itself with each listening, and numerous interpreters from Charles Rosen to the Emerson String Quartet have offered illuminating versions which can be unreservedly recommended.  That said, this recording by Tatiana Nikolayeva is the one to which I return most frequently.  It is a work of genius performed with  diamondlike clarity by an artist of fierce intelligence, supreme technical skill and emotional depth.  This is most definitely a desert island disc."
769,4,Me encanto este cd esta hermoso... se los recomiendo ampliamente... estan lindas las canciones y muy bien interpretadas por una persona con un talento entregado a Dios.
770,5,"My mom had this on cassette and LP.  It's just not Christmas without it.  Makes me think of her.  I just did a quick search online to see if I could find it in digital form (I realize the LP won't last forever).  I can't believe how difficult it was to find.  This is a true \\""album.\\"""
771,5,"Amy Dalley is a great singer who puts a lot of heart into her music along with a splash of attitude, and she writes her own songs, too.  This is a great CD, but it's a shame it costs so much on Amazon.  $40 for a CD?"
772,4,"This is one of my favorite albums at the time of writing this.  I love the sound of their metalcore screams combined with the techno (dubstep even in a few songs).  I would highly recommend to anyone who listens to Asking Alexandria, Enter Shikari, or The Plot In You."
773,5,"I was a big fan of Graham Parker in the seventies and early eighties when either he or I dropped the ball.  This is the first album of his I have bought since then and I have been delighted by the consistent quality, bite, and texture of the music as well as the high quality lyrics.  He is (stilll?) on top of his game after all these years.  I have enjoyed listening to the entire album many times since the purchase."
774,5,"I have had the privilege to see HoneyHoney perform several times since their first EP \\""Loose Boots\\"" was released, when it was just Ben and Suzanne, tearing it up live on the air in studio. No studio tricks, no backing tracks...just a couple of amazing multidimensional musicians and Suzanne...WOW, that woman can SANG! Soulful and sinful. Catch them live if you can. You wont be disappointed!"
775,3,"\\""Other Voices\\""  #31  (1971).  The Doors without Jim Morrison who died in France earlier in the year, would release their 7th long player \\""Other Voices\\"", all 3 would get a chance to sing.  \\""Tightrope Ride\\"", was a minor hit #71, a very good rocker.  The upbeat and hazy tune \\""I'm Horny (I'm Stoned)\\"" other interesting numbers were, \\""In The Eye Of The Sun\\"" and \\""Down On The Farm\\"".  Really a pretty strong album, but they really do miss Jim.  They would release \\""Full Circle\\"" in the summer of '72."
776,3,"Not one of the best country cds in the world and would not reccomend, too many artists that sounded  more like rock/roll than pure country"
777,5,"King Crimson is the perfect band for multichannel sound, in my opinion. People who like labels frequently toss Crimso into the progressive-rock pot, but the truth is that, since its inception more than four decades ago, and despite numerous personnel shifts, King Crimson always has sounded unique.<br /><br />\\""Starless and Bible Black\\"" is from the era featuring David Cross on violin and keyboards, John Wetton on bass and vocals, Bill Bruford on drums and the ever-present Robert Fripp on guitar and Mellotron. While it's never been my favorite KC album, it's always ranked well -- I'd put it far ahead of discs such as \\""Islands,\\"" \\""Lizard\\"" and even \\""In the Wake of Poseidon.\\""<br /><br />The vocal tracks are consistently good; Wetton is in great voice, and the pieces (with one exception) all feature strong lyrics. \\""The Great Deceiver\\"" references Lucifer but also seems to be some kind of indictment of materialism, while \\""Lament\\"" mourns the loss of innocence from the point of view of (what else?) a rock star. \\""The Night Watch\\"" refers to the Rembrandt painting, and comes across as an exceptionally thoughtful piece of rock 'n' roll poetry. For me, the only disappoint is \\""The Mincer,\\"" with abstract lyrics that make very little impression.<br /><br />Of the instrumentals here, my favorites are the two closing pieces, \\""Starless and Bible Black\\"" and \\""Fracture.\\"" Note: Buyers should beware that \\""Starless and Bible Black\\"" is, as I've written here, an instrumental, and not the moving, vocal-with-lyrics piece \\""Starless,\\"" which actually appears on \\""Red,\\"" the album that followed this one. Confusing, yes -- and it seems to happen in this genre. Led Zeppelin's song \\""Houses of the Holy\\"" actually appeared not on that album but on \\""Physical Graffiti.\\"" Anyway, \\""Starless\\"" the instrumental is a fine, tense, exploratory piece. As for \\""Fracture\\"": A (noisy) guitar masterpiece written by Fripp, who has said on more than one occasion that it's the most difficult piece he's ever composed/played.<br /><br />The surround mix: There's not a lot of gimmickry here, but the presence of several channels does allow the listener to hear the individual instruments more clearly.br />The surround mix: There's not a lot of gimmickry here, but the presence of several channels does allow the listener to hear the individual instruments more clearly."
778,5,"This album has weight.  It's overflowing with clever, rich material and it's clear that Marian put a big part of her heart into this work.  It's revealing in a trusting and fragile way, music that makes you think and stir and hop.  This is music for everyone."
779,5,"I will write this review en English for the rest of the folks on Amazon.  Basically this is one of the all-time classic Salsa albums.<br /><br />With songs like Hojas Blancas, Mujer Celosa, Y No Hago Mas Na'; you can't help but want to move your feet (and other parts of your body).<br /><br />If you at all like Salsa or Caribbean dance music, don't hesitate and get it."
780,5,"It's perfect! It's the best concert of Tokio Hotel I've ever seen! Bill's voice is at its best! Just beautiful! And the whole atmosphere of the concert..it's just so emotional! There's an acoustic version of Humanoid and of course some really beautiful and touching ballads of Tokio Hotel. And there is a little mix of old and new videos that is really touching, 'cause you see how they were when they were ''babies'' and how they are now.. and you realise how many years have passed and how much you love these guys... :')You'll probably find yourself smiling or even crying (like me xD).. ;) In addition this is the Deluxe Edition and it includes the Audio CD AND the DVD!!! Awesome!!! I was so excited when I got it! And it was delivered really FAST! I totally recommend this to you!  I hope you enjoy it"
781,5,one of the best musicals...i find that i like to listen to it when going on a trip...able to listen to all of the cd...tells a great story  and the music is just great
782,5,Buy this CD! This girl can sing and she can fiddle. I can't take this CD out of my CD player. Awesome music.
783,2,"I was so in love with this quartet's debut Born that I rushed right out and bought this disc, hoping for more of the same.  The cd cover should have been a huge giveaway, because even the Corrs sisters never took photos like THAT.  So, as one guy I used to work with asked me, \\""Are they models?\\""  Um, yeah...well, they might as well be with this outing.  Too many highly technoed-up tracks, sorry excuses for classical music for...well, WHO?  Minivan mommies exposed to their kids' hiphop?  Said kids?  The criminally insane?<br /><br />In short here, what we get are junky takes on what should be gypsy violins deluged like a super rich death-by-chocolate sundae with an entire can of Redi Whip, 3 different fudge sauces, a pound of nuts, and a very exhausted, lonely cherry on the top crying out for a life preserver.  You're left wondering where the ice cream went.  Well, you essentially get three spoonfuls:  The innovative take on Allegretto, a superbly abridged take on Zeppelin's Kashmir, and the James Bond theme \\""Bond on Bond.\\""<br /><br />That said, nothing else holds any slight interest here, and I listened to this disc 3 times.  Don't worry, because you can do worse, like their followup albums.  I like my ice cream mostly pure with a bit of kick to it.  I want my music the same way.  For this very reason, I'll not buy another Bond album until I see signs of this British quartet playing down the Cindy Crawford bit and becoming dedicated as they seemed to be on Born.  I've said it to people a million times before, and I'll say it again:  Born is the only Bond album worthy of space in your collecion.  Too bad, but all you need for proof of my point is to compare anything else they've done since with that one."
784,5,This is the perfect Barney CD.  Has all the kids favorite songs. I have 3 grandchindren and this CD has to be in every car!!!  Even calms the 3 month old.  There is something special about Barney. The 3 year old loves singing along. Great purchase!
785,5,I bought and Used this for my high school class reunion.  It brought back memories and everyone seemed to enjoy it.
786,5,"I have recently (re)discovered ELO and the genius of Jeff Lynne, (thanks, You Tube) and I purchased this collection to get in to the vibe. I received it in the mail about a week ago, and I still haven't got around to play cd nr 2, I'm still listening to the first cd, playing it over and over again, never getting bored or tired with it. The musical world of Mr. Lynne and Electric Light Orchestra are absolutly amazing and I will higly recommend this album to anyone who wants to get to know this music and those great talents the band was."
787,4,"Ms. Peretyatko is entirely a new soprano to me.<br />In this album, she includes standard lyrical coloratura repertoire as well as lyrical soprano tracks.<br />My immediate reaction is that she is much better in the lyrical soprano fach than the coloratura fach.<br />The timbre gets edgy when she tackles the upper register's high notes, and it is a less than suave outcome, thereby not giving the compositions' 'bel canto' due: her Lucia is edgy; the Olympia shouty.<br />However, as the album moves on to the romantic lyrical tracks like Rusalka and La Rondine, we finally hear the true strength of Ms. Peretyatko's soprano.<br />Hers is a typical lyrical soprano with a full-bodied middle register, beautifully cushioning her upper register. The voice is warmly affecting, and she sings with good musical intelligence.<br />But the voice is not that of a high soprano, for sure. Though she may have the requisite technique to tackle individual high notes, the absence of the true timbre bars her from vocal coherence in respect of the high-lying tessitura.<br />In due course, she will develop into a lyrical spinto rather than a dramatic coloratura."
788,5,"Having been a huge Glen Campbell fan for many, many years, this newest collection of music Glen is at his finest. Ghost on the Canvas is full of music many of us can relate to in our own lives. It's sad to think this CD is probably his last and reminds all of us of our own mortality. Glen is one of the top 10 guitarist in the world. I remember his one of three 12-string guitars in the world given to him by the late Chet Atkins many years ago. If you liked Glens music, his television show, his guitar playing or just his talent as an entertainer, you've got to own this, his final Farewell CD. After Glen announced that he is suffering from Alzheimer's disease, then saying he'd be going on the road for a farewell tour and asks his fans to bear with him."
789,5,The CD has some of Matthew West's new songs that are being played on the radio and an extra CD with Christmas songs. A good buy!
790,4,"The heat and noise surrounding this album has been quite intense and reflects a view that on his second album North Carolina native Jonathan Wilson has produced a startlingly accurate piece of musical archaeology by uncovering a lost vibe from 1970s Laurel Canyon and tapping directly into the laid-back Californian aesthetic of singers like James Taylor, Jackson Browne and Neil Young. What you have to decide dear listener is whether \\""Gentle Spirit\\"" builds upon that legacy in a meaningful and progressive way or alternatively is a piece of high end hippy bilge from a singer locked into another time. The issue with this album is that it actually plays into both narratives although the balance is generally well on the side of the righteous. One issue to address immediately is that if your musical bus is seeking out exciting times make sure you please don't get off at this stop. This album is so laid back it makes the Cowboy Junkies sound like death metal. And yet like Bon Iver's \\""For Emma\\"" it whittles away at your musical sensibilities and very occasionally gently beats some of them into total submission. That said at 13 tracks on a double album size disc with many songs stretching over 8 minutes it is a very long and languid album requiring a saintlike degree of patience and perseverance plus the right ambience to fully appreciate the best of these songs and equally discard the worse (albeit most are excellent).<br /><br />There are tracks which standout from first listen not least the lovely eight minute tour de force \\""Desert Raven\\"" which reminds you of the band America at their best and which is made for watching the light go down over a sun drenched Californian sunset. Its that peerless West Coast soft rock that used to turn mere musicians into uber rich white powder sniffing ego maniacs languishing from the weight of dollars that flowed from achieving 20 million album sales. When it comes to the gently rolling acoustic \\""Ballad of the pines\\"" you can almost hear the wind chimes and feel an immediate urge to cross your legs and contemplate higher beings. Hardly surprising then that the album contains an excellent nine minute song entitled \\""Natural Rhapsody\\"" which starts off sounding like a mix of Radiohead and \\""Tomorrow never knows\\"" but settles into an almost Pink Floyd style lament infused by liquidly guitar lines alia Jerry Garcia and a dreamy vocal by Wilson. You will either love it or it will bore you senseless, indeed this reviewer can't really go into into much detail on the albums longest track the 10 minute plus \\""Valley of the Silver moon\\"" because I feel asleep listening to it, although I recall a Neil Young \\""slower than slow\\"" guitar coda and some good vocals before the land of nod beckoned. Alternatively the much shorter surreal acoustic blues of \\""Can we really party today\\"" is strangely enticing and immediately recalls the work of David Crosby. It is here we also discover the touchstone since \\""Gentle Spirit\\"" does owe a huge debt to Crosby's trippy masterwork \\""If I could only remember my name\\"" a superb evocation of Californian counter culture packed with great songs. True there are songs on here that Wilson could have left to languish on the cutting room floor such as the slightly silly \\""Dont give your heart to a rambler\\"" which is mercifully short and \\""Woe is me\\"" which is horribly long. You can however forgive him these indulgences particularly when it comes to songs as good as the spacey title track or the excellent \\""Magic is everywhere\\""<br /><br />On an album such as this try before you buy would be a wise option. In the final analysis it would be easy to ridicule some of the cringe worthy idealism contained in the lyrics which are infused with statements of the \\""natural world needs our energy\\"" variety. Yet there is enough musical invention and innovation in \\""Gentle Spirit\\"" to hold your attention and draw you back for further listens. Finally before that ubiquitous Amazon insult \\""the kings new clothes\\"" is bandied aroundplease re-read the health warnings contained in this review for like the work of Joanna Newsom the songs of Jonathan Wilson will attract admirers and detractors in equal measure. Ultimately hat's off to man for the sheer scale of ambition contained therein and it is over to you herald a gigantic folly of early 70s pastiche or a triumph of cosmic Americana.d the health warnings contained in this review for like the work of Joanna Newsom the songs of Jonathan Wilson will attract admirers and detractors in equal measure.

791,4,"Ever since the Texan duo Ghostland Observatory shot onto the indie music scene around 2005 or so, they have been cleverly mashing electro with rock and even some funk as well, to great effect, and steadily growing their fan base with their live shows (more on that later). This is the band's 4th studio album.<br /><br />\\""Codename: Rondo\\"" (10 tracks; 34 min.) starts off with an insanely catchy \\""Glitter\\"" and right away, the party is on! It is followed by an equally outstanding \\""That's Right\\"". The first half of the album concludes with the okay (but not great) title track, and \\""Give Me the Beat\\"", which says all you need to know. In the second half the band carries on with uptempo tracks like \\""Body Shop\\"", \\""Freeze\\"" and \\""Time\\"" (no, not the Pink Floyd cover). The only song on the album that does not resonate with me is \\""Mama\\"", which is GLO's idea of a ballad I suppose, but the song falters badly. But the album goes out on a high with \\""Kick Clap Speaker\\"". In all, this is an enjoyable album pretty much from start to finish, but for 1 or 2 weaker songs. At just over half an hour though, you'll find yourzelf zooming through the album, and playing it again.<br /><br />But the REAL Ghostland Observatory can only be experienced live in concert, of course. I have seen them a number of times over the year, and about 2 weeks ago I saw them at the 9:30 CLub in DC in support of the new album. The laser show was once again outstanding. The band played about half of the new album (including Glitter, Time, Freeze, the title track, and Kick Clap Speak), but they also played many of the \\""classics\\"" including Midnight Voyage and Sad Sad City, just to name those. In all, what a fantastic evening of music that was. Do yourself a favor and catch GLO on the road touring behind \\""Codename: Rondo\\"". You will thank me later."
792,5,"Having discovering her too late, nowadays I'm only listenin' Dawn Landes. Though it's one of the very first albums in her career, tracks in this album have driven me little crazy. Musical quality never goes under the ones who gave life to classic rock in 60's & 70's.<br /><br />I'm very excited. With less musical effect of her husband Josh, and if she's taken off them Bandana Splits, why not the next album be the best non-Dylan album till 'Full Moon Fever'!"
793,5,I have been looking for a collection of music to use with my music-based preschool. Each year I like to add new versions of old favorites. I'm very pleased with the quality of the music and the variety of songs. I'm delighted that I bought this set.
794,1,"Amazon's website, as well as the package itself, proclaims this to be a 5-CD set. Guess again. I dismantled the entire case, every piece of plastic, thinking perhaps there was some secret chamber where the fifth CD (of Purcell's Fantasias) had been hidden. Not only is there no fifth CD anywhere, there isn't even a place where a fifth disc could be stashed--it's a 4-CD jewelbox, pure and simple. Worse, when I tried to exchange it for a complete 5-disc set--which, judging from other reviews, does exist in some territories of the country--I got a note saying that while I could get a refund, Amazon can't offer an exchange. I will grant that the price is still low for a four-CD set, but if you're hoping to get the disc of Purcell, don't bother."
795,3,"To maximise the dissemination of these early to middle piano concertos, Mozart himself downsized them so that the orchestral accompaniment could be undertaken by a string quartet - which demonstrates how primitive these works are compared with the later piano concertos whose reliance on woodwind is absolute. Even so, they are all wonderful works.<br /><br />These performances were recorded in the late 1980s.<br /><br />Collard has never received his due and he is the main attraction here. His musicianship is masterly - and here, for once, he is well served by the engineers. Contrary to current practice, he uses a leviathan of a piano, be it a Steinway or a Bosendorfer - but he ensures that it does not swamp the string players, who likewise are stylish in their playing. As always, Collard's rubato is masterly. One walks away with new insights (and this is especially true of the E Flat, K 449).<br /><br />There are so many fine performances of these works in full orchestral dress. As such there is no real reason, other than Collard's artistry, to acquire these worthy discs."
796,5,I really like this artist. I saw him open up for Toby Mac/ Skillet. I really enjoyed him and wanted to get his cd. I got this one today and I love it.
797,5,"Kudos to Cedille Records and the performers for undertaking this project. I hope it is only the first in a series, since so many Pulitzer-winning scores are now difficult to find or were never recorded. The rarities by Schuman and Sowerby are especially well performed, and the pieces themselves are nicely representative of those composers' copious talents. The choir and orchestra are both top-notch.    Buyers should be forewarned that the packaging is phrased somewhat misleadingly regarding Copland's Appalachian Spring. The Pulitzer was granted to the original ballet version for thirteen instruments, but this recording includes the shorter concert suite for full orchestra. This was a mild disappointment to me, as the original version is splendid yet rarely recorded.

798,5,"WOW!!  I didn't know this  has been around for over 30 years. I bought mine when it first came out on CD (nearly 20 years ago) and still play it while doing massage.  I love the tone of his voice and the way he weaves the Sanskrit language into the theme(s) of the music. It is literally healing mantra's sung in sanskrit) My Massage clients always comment on how much more they are relaxed and sometimes \\""carried off into spiritual meditation\\"" with this music. Clearly a gifted artist. I have two more of his early releases and glad that I do They are like investing in Gold.<br /><br />Harold Gill"
799,5,"All my family loves this group--my husband, and teenage sons and daughter--and that says a lot!  Awesome, uplifting, Spirit-filled!  Need all that!!"
800,5,"I already had the PM yoga meditation CD and so this product is exactly what I was looking for and met all of my expectations.  I love each of the four 15-minute meditations and like that I can pick and choose just one or use a combination depending on my mood and agenda for the day.  Her voice is soothing and her guided imagery is very effective.  I recommend it to anyone, especially a beginner who never did yoga or meditation before, because it's so user friendly and calming, and I feel centered and clear-headed after just one of her meditations."
801,5,"But I love it.    This album has layers.  Listen to it with headphones on and you will see that the complexity of this album is in its subtlety.  It's simply beautiful music that has layers and layers upon each other.  Those that complain of the lack of Kilmore or Mike are not looking at the landscape that they set for the music that is portrayed in this album.  It's beautiful, symbolic, powerful.  I love it.    The only gripe that I have about this album is that they should have included all of the B-sides.  They are vintage Incubus and are absolutely amazing.  Take this CD and add \\""Surface to Air\\"" (one of my favorite Incubus songs period), \\""Rebel Girls\\"", and \\""Hold Me Down\\"", and nobody complains about this album because it would have had a balance between melody and rock.    Listen to it with headphones.  Seriously.  And then get the B-sides.  You'll realize that Incubus still owns every other band out there."
802,3,"It is bluegrass, but not what I expected from Peter Rowan.  If you are into more old time Gospel type bluegrass you will love it.  Great sound, but not the music I really wanted.  Passed it along to another who loves it, so we recycled...!!!"
803,5,"I'm sorry to say that I had always considered Albinoni to be a \\""one-hit wonder,\\"" (and of course that one hit wasn't really composed by Albinoni).  Nothing could be further from the truth.  These Opus 9 concertos - most for one or two oboes, a few for violin - are a delight from start to finish.  My two favorites are the second (which, as other reviewers have pointed out, has a slow movement as lovely as anything you're ever likely to hear), and the seventh.  But there really isn't a weak composition in the lot.  I actually find these pieces more musically interesting than much of Vivaldi; and, because of the sheer sense of joy one hears in them, they often remind me of Handel.  The performances are absolutely first-rate.  Hogwood has brisk tempos without ever sounding rushed, the textures are clear, and the soloists are also very good.  Even at the list price of $18 (I bought a very good used copy for half that), this set is a bargain!"
804,3,"The House of Blue Light is the 12th studio album by Deep Purple; their second since the reunion with Gillian and Blackmore and therefore the sixth studio album overall by the MKII line up.<br /><br />Their previous album, Perfect Strangers, had been successful and acclaimed, mixing the style of their most famous album, Machine Head, with a (at the time) modern edge.<br /><br />While their previous album made some minor concessions to the sounds of the 1980s, The House Of Blue Light takes this idea much further, incorporating much more distinctly 80s sounds and styles, in addition to a production job which was a little bit more 80s than Perfect Strangers. Furthermore, while Perfect Strangers was mostly driving and had a rock attitude, `Blue Light is slicker and more like a collection of hit singles than an album of light and shade.<br /><br />A fair amount of long-time Deep Purple fans were turned off by this album, either because they had a stylistic problem, or just because it was seen as a weak album in terms of songwriting. Consequently, you won't find the band really supporting anything off of this album live.<br /><br />In all fairness, there are undoubtedly better Deep Purple albums available, but even so this is hardly an abomination. Tracks like `The Unwritten Law,' showcase Paice's drumming skills, `Mad Dog,' `Strange Ways,' and `Black & White,' all have the driving sound that made the previous album so good. Finally even those who don't like the album can agree on `Hard Lovin' Woman,' one of the heavier tracks on offer.<br /><br />In summary; The House of Blue Light is still a fairly good Deep Purple album, but perhaps too 80s in places. For newcomers, it is definitely not the first album you should get by the band, but you should still think about adding it to your collection eventually."
805,5,"Like new! Case, insert and disc plus it has Ranking Full Stop and Tears of A Clown. First come first served $15 plus postage (thats what I paid for it). If interested, I'm posting it for sale here on Amazon. Look for it under used discs for this listing. 11 july 2011, it wont last long..."
806,5,i got this for a bday gift for my better half and it took like 2 or 3 weeks to get to me. i cant remember
807,4,"Four brand new remixes of the classic hit by DB. All are well done. Would have been nice to have a few more. The last remix (Jeremy Sole) is worth the price alone. In one word, phenomenal."
808,5,"Pre-ordered this album through ABR's vendor, with the added bonus of an album specific T-shirt.  To my surprise, I received it a day before the actual release date.  Right off the bat I could tell that ABR has been busy trying new things and looking for tweaks to enhance their sound.  Of particular note, they've gone away from multiple breakdowns per song and have worked with adding slower, melodic passages to contrast with the inevitable sledgehammer of sound that will again hit you in the chops to finish off the song.  Don't worry, there are still some breakdowns but they are much more satisfying in fewer numbers, trust me.  The depth and breadth of ABR's sound is ever-expanding on this album.  Jake is using more range all while still screaming and growling with his usual passion and conviction.  Guitars and drums have all been jacked up a notch for this new album... faster, louder, more complex -- all better than ever before.  This album demonstrates a more intentional and mature level of songwriting and you can tell.  Songs like Internal Cannon and Poor Millionaire are prime examples of their willingness to up the ante and maybe even experiment a little with new styles.  Leveler will assuredly be a great chapter in the careers of these guys and will likely get to 100k copies sold.  Whether you are a new fan or an old die-hard, this album will impress.  Sampling the tracks will NOT give you a good idea of the awesomeness within, you just need to buy it!"
809,5,This album caught my eye in Target and I purchased it and am so glad I did. Every song on this cd is a hit! Especially On The Floor and Into You. J-Lo rocks all the way! I even have her earlier album ON THE 6 and I recommend it to all you other J-Lo fans! It has many of her earlier classic hits on it!!! I am so happy I have two J-Lo cds. They really jam!!!
810,4,"This is truly the most realistic film made on dance   music culture. However, I prefer the double CD import  from Japan. I bought the CD, just to listen to NYC Peach  Boys doing their classic jam, \\""Life is Something Special\\"".  Larry Levan was an incredible talented New York DJ, who  revolutionized dance music. He died very young, but he  made his mark as the legendary pioneer of Garage music."
811,5,"Although they are all Xmas tunes, this can be played anytime of the year. Well done as usual by Beegie."
812,5,"While Heaven Wept is an epic band, to the point. Starting out as a straight doom band, WHW have progressed into a more epic, traditional style with elements of doom. This album has some of their shortest tracks, but hit real hard. Last track is more classic WHW with 11 minutes that build up.  Vocals soar high and are a stand out on this album. Rain Irving is just stupendous. Every instrument on here works together to create a mood that moves you. They will be playing at ProgPower this year and can't wait to see some of these songs in the live setting. Can not go wrong with this album. Definitely pick it up, and on vinyl if you can, and their other albums. Turn this one way up."
813,5,I have enjoyed Roger Williams' music since the 60s. I was very happy to see that I could get a combined album of Til/Near You on Amazon.  The CD quality is great and just listening to the songs brings back wonderful memories. Roger Williams is a timeless artist.
814,5,My 3 year old daughter loves these Christian songs. They are easy to understand and fun to listen to. A great purchase.
815,5,"I was so amazed when I got this CD and listened to it. The band is captured at its peak, during an incredible live performance. Some people said that it is too loud and not mixed well, however in my opinion it's just loud enough, and is mixed wonderfully for a live CD. Granted, there is some background and auidence noise in some parts; overall, though the sound quality is awesome! And let's face it, part of the joy of listening to a live CD is hearing the auidence and the surroundings and absorbing the \\""atmosphere\\"" where the band is playing. If you don't want this, then buy a canned, non-live version and listen to that. I love hearing the crowd, and this does NOT mean that any of the music is drowned out by background noise. The crowds enthusiasm and input adds something to the tracks. Admittedly, I'm not a huge fan of this band, and I don't know all of their material. That being said, after listening to this CD, I had a new appreciation for them and for their talent and their ability to captivate an audience. If you like even a few songs this band does, I think you'll really like this CD a lot, and you should put it on your list of things to purchase. Music is a huge part of my life, and when I can't be there to see a band live, a CD such as this is the next best thing and makes me very happy. Give it a shot, and you might be pleasantly surprised. I know I was!"
816,4,"I thought perhaps I should add my impressions, if only to add perspective given the other review. I found this to a be a very good \\""central\\"" interpretation, and one which may well be a first choice if you prefer big-band Brahms. The recording and the orchestra are excellent and the performance is quite good, if a bit plain and under interpreted. Should Decca reissue this at mid-price or lower it would be quite competitive. Those considering Karajan or Abbado's readings would be well advised to seek this out, as it is - to these ears - a far better alternative.     In the long run, it is not as distinctive as Wand or (if you prefer the early-music approach) Mackerras, but it does sound fantastic and is easy to live with. Walter is an acceptable alternative, but one must put up with a poor orchestra and a recording that's not very good. Again, worth considering if you favor an old-world style of performance and can find a copy at a discount."
817,5,"I recently purchased three of the \\""BLESSINGS\\"" cd's by LAURA STORY.  One was for myself and the other two were for friends.  I can tell you this CD is FANTASTIC, the \\""blessings\\"" song was my favorite; but they were all so great.  I find things I want and they usually get here faster than expected.  I like purchasing things through AMAZON... If I don't need it right away, it is nice to buy from a company you have faith in and a company that knows how to deal well with their customers."
818,5,"This is box set came in Perfect Condition. It came flawless!!!! The sound quality is from another world (Trust me, I'm 16, I've been a Sabbath fan since I was 11). It's incredible!! I never heard Sabbath this clear in my life. Especially in their album \\""Master of Reality\\"" which sounds very muddy and quiet on the CD release from 1988. But on these remasters, it sounds way clearer, louder, and more vibrant. If you are looking for superior sound quality, this is the set for you! I love this so much!!! Now, I need to save money for the Led Zeppelin Box-set. Thanks AMAZON!!"
819,4,"I would definitely have to say this is dark. Don't get me wrong, I like the music. It is quite a refreshing departure from the average garbage being put out by the so called top artists these days. It is music you can just kick back, close your eyes, and enjoy the ride with.    One comment though. I was sitting here listening to it and it really reminds me of a much older group called \\""Dead Can Dance\\"". I have a feeling there is a bit of an influence from that group in here. Anyway, I really like the music and would highly recommend it to anyone not stuck inside the musical box that surrounds most people these days."
820,5,"THIS GROUP OF OF PEOPLE REALLY KNOWS HOW TO FUNK YOUR EARHOLE !!!!  GEORGE CLINTON AND THE GANG REALLY LET THEIR CREATIVE JUICES FLOW EACH TIME THEY ARE IN THE STUDIO, PRODUCING HIT ALBUM AFTER AFTER HIT ALBUM.

I LOVE THIS ALBUM , WHAT ELSE CAN BE SAID ???  PUT THIS CD ON AND LET THEM GROOVE YOU IN YOUR EAR HOLE.  \\"" FAR 'ROUND \\"" !"
821,5,"My journey to having this among my most played discs is long and winding. At some point is discovered Gram Parsons and Outlaw Country. Part of that necessarily including getting interested in Sweetheart of the Rodeo and its epic Parsons' composition \\""Hickory Wind\\"". I was never terribly interested in the Byrds' other stuff, but I was interested in Dylan covers, and then covers of great country and folk songs in general. I got more familiar with Hillman's role in country rock by reading up on the Flying Burrito Brothers. One day while looking through his stuff I ran across the tracklisting on this disc which included not only \\""Hickory Wind\\"" but also my favorite dead song, \\""Ripple\\"", and \\""The Taker\\"" which is a great Shel Silverstein song done by Waylon Jennings. I figured, hey if he's running through a set with songs like these, its got to be promising. Its better than promising. This album is relentlessly laid back. Its like a bunch of great musicians jamming country and bluegrass on the porch of a ranch farmhouse. Its intimate, the harmonies are glorious, and the renditions of each and every song is classic. I've gotten to the point where if I'm having a good Sunday morning, driving back from the country, or just heading out somewhere. This is the record I put on. It's pretty close to a traditional bluegrass record except with ample amount of pedal steel guitar. The version of \\""Good Time Charlie's Got the Blues\\"" is classic and probably the best song on the record. \\""Ripple\\"" is a great contrasting take to the original. In general all of the songs have this laid back, kind of reflective fondless for life. Its a shame this record is not more highly known. Its not a groundbreaking superstar record, but that's kind of the point its an appreciation of an American music, probably played by ex-hippies who got it in the first place."
822,4,"This is a very rare album to come by. I have a cassette of it, but wanted a cd.  If you are a Gregory Isaacs fan, I recommend it. I would not say it is  one of his top five albums, but it's good. I don\\""t believe any of the songs are on other albums of his, at least I have not heard them."
823,1,"One of his worse, too bad he was a great Rock & Roll idol. Buy his old stuff. It's a crying shame..."
824,1,I played samples of this compilation CD on Amazon.com and liked the songs. I was disappointed when I received the disk. Each song is preceeded by a loud repetitive noise for many seconds as if the player is stock. And then the song follows. Very annoying for an otherwise good raggae music.
825,4,"As a fan since the very beginning, I can simply say that this album is among the very best they've made. A clear modern sound with melody lines that refer to the early eighties. I played the CD many times and can only conclude that I am still not bored. On the contrary, the album only gets better! For fans, the DVD is a nice extra. Besides a general \\""making of\\"" there is for almost every track some background information about the realization of it. Buy it!"
826,5,"What can you say - two fabulous people coming together and making the most wonderful music.  A glass of wine (or a cup of tea), sit back, close your eyes and enjoy this amazing duo."
827,5,"A must see movie.  The soundtrack is heartwarming, and makes one yearn for home.  And, there are many positive songs for an uplifting listen."
828,4,This has a lot of great holiday tunes and the wonderful Israel Kamakawiwo'ole version of Over the Rainbow that brings tears to the eyes it's so lovely.
829,1,"I was very disappointed with that CD. I thought ''Zorba the Greek'' would be the original version, but it is by far the worst version I have ever listened to. The rest of the CD is also boring. I actually got rid of it very quickly. Sorry, but it's not what I was expecting to hear."
830,5,"This CD is typical Strawberry Shortcake fare: extremely sweet. The songs send a very positive message regarding friendship between people all over the world, without prejudice or bias. The songs teach children to pursue friendships with people even when backgrounds, like and dislikes don't match. Each song emphasizes personal strength, determination, and/or the willingness to go beyond boundaries to learn about and empathize with others. I would recommend this to any Strawberry Shortcake fan."
831,5,"This is classic War that fills the void in my collection.  I had purchased later albums of War already, but wanted some of their older, first hits.  This CD is an excellent compilation of War's early popular songs like \\""The Cisco Kid,\\"" \\""Southern Part of Texas,\\"" \\""Me And Baby Brother,\\"" (a Soul Train dance hit) and \\""Summer.\\""  Thank-you to the distributors for releasing this collection on CD."
832,1,"Releases like this are why I generally stay away from \\""mainstream\\"" bands.    Save your money. Don't even pirate it. It's that bad."
833,5,"Perhaps everything has been said about this album; it certainly defines early Genesis sound. My only problem with it arouse quite recently, when I became more aware of Anthony Phillips' contribution in defining this unique style and even more, his likely (to me, obvious) contribution in writing material that was used in several of Genesis' masterpieces. I believe it's the duty of every fan of the band to rectify this error and make it known that this most accomplished composer and guitar player's influence on the band did not end the moment he left."
834,5,"The Other Side Of Down has exceeded all my expectations from the first track to the last.  David's smooth velvety voice singing beautiful melodies and lyrics that are uplifting and optimistic. From the soulful title track The Other Side Of Down to the his love ballad, My Kind Of Perfect.  The lyrics to Good Place and Look Around are so unique and smart.  I went to David's concert in Anaheim on 12/29 and to hear him sing these songs live is an experience no one should miss. David has come a long way from his AI days taking command of the stage and connecting with his audience like no other singer I've ever seen.  It's to bad Jive didn't see it fit to promote this great CD and hoping it catches wind because it's to good not to get it's just do.  Looking forward to anything and everything David has to offer."
835,3,"Some abstract electronics from Kandis on his album 1996-99. The rhythms never stray beyond mid-tempo trip-hop, but there's a careful melodic sensibility that makes the project appeals. On \\""Intro,\\"" for example, there's a rattling (like someone shaking a glass of marbles) that help ground the more squelchy sounds to follow. Similarly, \\""Treasure Island\\"" is rooted in the heavy bassline, but kept buoyant by the lighter tones above it. The quiet vocals in \\""Waiting\\"" add a nice texture to the track. On the downside, there's a tendency to take a single theme and repeat it ad infinitum, and with such pleasant sounds, it's easy to get lost in the track and completely forget you're listening to it. That is, of course, until you get to \\""Dilldop [B2]\\"" which distinguishes itself by being much more aggressive percussively; \\""Val Wok\\"" continues in the same vein, while \\""Set Tecker\\"" returns to earlier niceties, but with an industrial underpinning. \\""Dilldop [A1]\\"" goes even more industrial, but \\""Ivy\\"" and \\""Outro\\"" put us back in the mood to lay back and enjoy. While not particularly a stand-out album, you could do much worse than this."
836,5,"OOOooo! Every home should have a copy of this beautiful and relaxing CD. If every car had this CD to play, we'd end road rage. I only have one other record by Bonfa and I love them both! I'll no doubt buy more from this amazing musician."
837,5,"Ein Bluesalbum wie man es sich nur wünschen kann. Voller Spielfreude und Enthusiasmus. Jack ist ein überaus fähiger Pianist, der alle Bluesstile beherrscht. Ob traditioneller Blues, Barrelhouse oder Swing, er beackert die ganze Palette, und das in einer faszinierenden Art. Die guten Begleitmusiker, wie Dennis Gruenling (Harp) oder Peter Karp (Guitar) runden dieses hervorragende Album ab. Bedenkenlos allen Bluesfreunden zu empfehlen. Ein Klasse Album. Schade, dass es nicht mehr von ihm zu hören gibt."
838,4,"As a previous reviewer said, this album did not have many hits. I can see three that charted...maybe four. That has nothing to do with the quality of a record, though.<br /><br />Every song on the record is good. I especially like \\""You're Dancing This Dance All Wrong\\"". It's pure Texas swing. This album is a little less honky-tonk than George's previous albums. It's swinging harder into Texas.<br /><br />It's a good album."
839,5,"I tried several recordings of this work before settling on this one and I have not been disappointed. The quality of the recording is excellent, the orchestra full and powerful. The choir and soloists project great joy and vigor combined with gentleness where called for. As for the piece itself, though it is an unusual hybrid of symphony and choral work, Mendelssohn's music shimmers with life and praise throughout.    Since I know German, the pronunciation of a German-language choral piece matters to me, so I was originally looking for a German production. However, this choir sings the German flawlessly and I was instantly smitten by the overall excellence of this recording.     Claudio Abbado, the LSO & these soloists have brought this piece to life in a powerful, moving recording that is second to none. This music has power to lift your spirits! Highly recommended."
840,5,"I HATE musicals.... HATE THEM!!!    And this was written by Joss Whedon, who is not a songwriter.   And sung by the cast, who are not professional singers.   All this sounds like it should be a disaster...     But this episode is simply amazing.  It is one of the greatest TV episodes ever.  The lyrics are so beautiful, and actually forward the season and the series.  EVERYTHING about this episode works.  But would the soundtrack work for someone like me, who likes punk (Lagwagon, Strung Out) and metal (As I Lay Dying, A7)?    The answer is YES!!  The soundtrack reminds me of this wonderful episode, and one of the greatest TV series of all time.  I find myself singing out loud while driving and cleaning house to this amazing music.   Virtually every song is great for a different reason.     I don't know that are ANY CD's on Amazon.com that has such great ratings.  On 2 idiots who can't appreciate this magnificent piece of work.  Joss took a huge chance, and wow, did he hit a home run with this episode and soundtrack."
841,5,"I love listening to Perlman's unique sound, and this little recording holds wonderful little jewels of many composers. The schmaltzy pop piece (from Schindler's List) always pulls my heart strings, but the more classic pieces are such morsels of pure treats also. I often purchase it for friends who I think might enjoy being introduced to a light program of violin music."
842,5,"U2 has produced two very impressive albums over the years; \\""The Joshua Tree\\"" and \\""Achtung Baby\\"". The latter one is simply their best album...period...bar none...case closed. There is really not much need to discuss the merits of the individual songs because they are all excellent. Unlike other records where certain songs make up the higher points this record flows from one song to the next without giving up a thing.   One of the amazing aspects of this record is that in 1991 it reflected a major change in the group's musical style and was a pretty risky move for a band that was still having incredible success from the 80's. No longer fixated on American society the band embraced its European roots and took on a sound more in line with what was going on in clubs across that continent. This album saw them kiss goodbye to everything they had done in the 80's and pointed them in a new direction. The results stand as their true high water mark with no other U2 album achieving this much consistency and innovation at the same time. Okay, I can't do this without picking one song...\\""\\""Mysterious Ways\\"" is my favorite U2 track of all time."
843,5,"Excelent players, very clean. great guitar album from 2 brothers from Buenos Aires, Argentina.  If you like Al Dimeola fusion style playing, this is the same excellence of brilliant playing with just acoustic guitars."
844,5,It is fantastic. I recommend it to any one who loves a beautiful voice. It arrived sooner than expected which is always a nice surprise.I look forward to many more cd's from this artist.
845,5,"I've made a 3-page double-sided Word doc of the 10 CDs in this package.   Anyone wanting a copy, email me at bausin at sbcglobal dot net."
846,5,a classic christmas cd.  this is one of those cds you just put in your player and let run on repeat. will definitely bring the spirit of christmas into your home. very peaceful and powerful.
847,5,"Love this vendor, not only did I receive the album I ordered, I also received a bonus disc with even more music on it."
848,5,"I really enjoy listening to all these songs.  I was looking forward to these cd's but didn't think I would get THAT much enjoyment out of it.  For people who are more romantically inclined, it's a good buy and I will recommend to all my friends :-)"
849,5,I came upon this group by mistake and glad I did. The music is very upbeat and to really appreciate the music I believe you need to visit their website or youtube to see their music videos.
850,5,"I'm one of those rare fans who likes Linkin Park for their more lyrical songs--\\""In the End\\"", \\""Nobody's Listening\\"", etc. Break out the screamo and forget it...I'm changing songs. So you can imagine how thrilled I was when I got through all fifteen tracks and discovered that there was only ONE screamo song on the entire album! (Or at least screamo as I understand it.)    There were some rather short and unusual tracks, but most of the album was simply amazing and utterly different from the Linkin Park I'm used to. There was one song I listened to (it might have been \\""Iridescent\\"") and thought, \\""WOW! Am I listening to Linkin Park or a boy band?!\\"" (And I don't mean \\""am I listening to a boy band\\"" in a bad way...I mean it was that smooth and...completely unlike what I'm used to in terms of Linkin Park!) I feel like I'm fumbling for adjectives...that's how much \\""A Thousand Suns\\"" affected me.      If you like Linkin Park for some of the same reasons I do, then \\""A Thousand Suns\\"" is worth your money. But if you're into traditional Linkin Park, forget it...go listen to their older work."
851,5,"after this is it was realesed i thought that was Michaels lst cd. when i found out about this one i was shocked i rented it from the libary and listened to it and loved it. Way to go Michael for not letting your fans down. this is a great cd. the best songs on this cd are<br /><br />hold my hand, hollywood tonight, breaking news and monster"
852,1,I was really happy to have found a collection that took me back too the eighties. I was very disappointed with this product. All my favorite songs skipped. It only got worse as I cleaned the disk. Just horrible. I would not suggest any purchase from this site...NO Way!
853,2,"this one is just so frustrating. you can tell someone from arista is breathing down their neck whole they are making this one.the tunes are not as great as the ones prior. if you liked \\""crank it up\\"" you probably went to see the 90210 yes concert and/or you have a mullet and/or a moustache. that tune is absolutely absurd...\\""have a million notes to play\\""...yeah i bet you do..can you imagine how embarrasing it is to steve morse or these other guys to hear that track..they want to hide probably..    ..go to the earlier albums..this is an example of a band and record company under-estimating the intelligence of the fans...for you kids, this album smacks (actually smells) of record exec involvement..just like the yes scholp i talked about here. if you like this, you probably have an intimate relationship with your tv set, too..please, kids...demand better. get the earlier dregs stuff, its great. this is not.  this is a not very good attempt at a sell-out."
854,5,"I was deployed for the Army in Iraq, shopping on Amazon, trying to buy the Third Season of BSG and ordered this disk by ACCIDENT; I was pretty upset with myself!  Considered sending it back because, c'mon, what kind of NERD buys the soundtrack to a SCIFI Series!?    Well, after a month or so, I finally decided:  since I BOUGHT it, I might as well LISTEN to it.      I still listen to it today.    If you are going to buy ONE soundtrack...get this one; it's just good.  It stands the test of time.  You can always find something new, or rediscover something each time you listen to it.      J"
855,5,"I've been huge fan of Darius Rucker's since his Hootie days. he consistently crafts some of the finest songs of our times. if you believe, as I do, that music/songs are built layer upon layer to a final work then you understand what I mean. there's very little music I listen to that I don't find myself thinking \\""I wish the guitar would have held that note a bit longer, or that empty spot should have a mandolin, or the bass/drums are getting lost in the mix, or the steel guitar wasn't allowed to finish it's comment...\\"" there's none of that with Darius' music. you sit and listen and the music washes over you and through you in it's completeness and finds places in your soul that need to be touched.    then there's that voice. like a comfy, worn old jacket you wear sitting on the front porch on a crisp evening sipping a glass of your favorite Whisky. I'm glad Darius chose to ply his craft in the Country genre where people with real talent will always find an audience even though I think great music defies being assigned a genre. thank you!"
856,5,"I can't recommend this CD highly enough.  I have listened to it over and over again and used some of its songs for guided meditation work.  Her voice is incredible and, though I have enjoyed her other CDs--such as her work in Vas and her second solo CD--having this work based on European chants and songs makes the past of Europe come alive in a new and refreshing way.     My favorite on the CD is \\""Breton Medley,\\"" though the song \\""Inna-I-Malak\\"" has a certain note on it that sends an absolute shiver down your spine.  The only other female artist that can do that, in my experience, is Lisa Gerrard, but there is something even more special about the music that Azam Ali picks to work with.      I sincerely hope that she will choose to release another CD someday with a European focus."
857,5,Susan Boyle has done it again!  This follow-up to her first CD release is as fabulous as the first.
858,5,"This is a classic cd. I bought this years ago on tape and loved it so much I replaced it. C0-workers have borrowed it to listen to on computers at work, and now they are buying it also."
859,3,"Superstar guitarist Carlos Santana fills in for a largely absent Wayne Shorter on this jazz fusion release from Joe Zawinul and company.  The title track is a powerful Zawinul/Santana jam with a driving rhythm that doesn't let up.  The rather repetitive \\""Face the Fire\\"" is something approaching World music, with its infectious beat that fortunately doesn't drag on too long.  \\""I'll Never Forget You\\"" is a still, meditative piece that I didn't much care for.  Mino Cenelu's \\""Jungle Stuff, Pt 1\\"" sounds like World Music again with its percolating rhythm and a nice sax solo from Shorter.  \\""Man with the Copper Fingers\\"" features Santana on lead guitar, playing a pleasant mid-tempo melody; this one's pretty cool.  \\""Consequently\\"" is a slower number featuring Shorter's sax and Victor Bailey's bass, but it's not one of my favorites.  \\""Update\\"" is a frenetic newsroom-sounding piece that showcases the keys and the drum kit - more noise than melody.  After all this, the closing \\""China Blues\\"" is pretty forgettable.  A couple of very good tracks, but much of this recording is either too mellow or too repetitive.  I give it three and a half stars."
860,5,"ahhhhhhmazing. i was not really a green day fan before seeing this musical and buying this cd. the music on this cd certainly gave me an appreciation for green day that i never had. it is some of the most stunning reworking/cover of songs I have ever heard. 21 guns is breath taking, and alone is worth the cd. i highly recommend this cd, even to those not big on musicals."
861,5,"I've been a Charlie Fan for almost 35 years. It's unfortunate Terry Thomas waited almost 25 years to put out another album. Yes, I said album. But for those of a certain age you will be pleased. The hook-filled melodies, the biting, cynical lyrics are all in place on this 2009 release. Even though the band line-up has changed more than the Charlie's Angels line-up, this has always been Thomas's band. This album is also one of the hardest rocking albums released under the Charlie banner, borderline metal on a few cuts. Well done Terry! Now if you would only launch a tour!"
862,5,"Animalize is the 12th studio album by the American band Kiss. In a continuation of the commercial resurgence begun with Lick It Up, Animalize was certified platinum by the RIAA on December 12, 1984. It was the highest-selling Kiss album since 1977's Alive II.  The album marked the only appearance by lead guitarist Mark St. John, who replaced Vinnie Vincent in April 1984. St. John would be forced to leave Kiss during the subsequent tour after being diagnosed with Reiter's Syndrome. By November 1984 he was out of the band; the third lead guitarist to exit the band in two years.  When asked what 'Animalize' meant, Stanley said that people were starting to become more like computers and that \\""making music by pressing buttons\\"" was no fun.  Mark Norton (aka Mark St John) stated that when recording this record, he had utilized his Rockman gear, and that heavy equalization was used to take the \\""Boston\\"" sound out of the recording.  Throughout the years, \\""Heaven's on Fire\\"" has been the only song from the album played regularly on live performances. One of my fav's, my opinion this album should have come post Lick It Up."
863,5,"I purchased this primarily because I love the \\""Theme from Markham\\"" which was done as a bolero.  I did a bolero exhibition at the Atlanta Star Ball at the Knights of Columbus hall in 1982 with a lady who was a student of mine at the time.  I still teach ballroom dancing and this is one of my favorite bolero recordings.  There are other songs that are very nice and there are a couple of real good east coast swings on the album as well.  I highly recommend this CD to anyone who loves to dance."
864,4,This is a great cd!! :) Every time I listen to it I feel like dancing. Great music and a must have for any World Cup fans!
865,5,"POW!! BLAM!! Sock. It. To. Me...In 1966, the Grateful Dead were underground mod. Taking almost garage-psyche, bubblegum groovy sounds across the 12 inch Day-Glo color television! Old blues numbers with a dancin'-in-the-street-at-the happening Love-In tempo. The organ sound is way up there (think ? & the Mysterians), the guitars twang and swang like a surf-rock instrumental. Historical, fun, and just plain neat-o! Find it somewhere! Download it! Get it! Dance the night away Dead-style! WHAM! THWACK!! So fun."
866,5,"Third Day is my favorite Christian group.  I have all of their CD's.  I have bought tickets to go see them 3-4 times, and haven't been able to go because of health problems. They never disappoint."
867,5,"A great CD, with it's mix of alternative, blues, latin, and folk style music.  With the Bestie Boys and Dust Brothers making some of the beats there was no way this album could be bad."
868,5,"I got this from the album launchin/concert held in Manila, Philippines. It's one of the best ballad albums i have. my favorite rendition of the songs in this albums are In My Eyes and She's out of my life. The Promise is a new song (that i'm aware of) but it's also good.<br /><br />Songs in this albums are as follows:<br />All My Life<br />What Matters Most<br />She's Out Of My Life<br />Out Here On My Own<br />In My Eyes<br />The Promise<br />Lean On Me<br />Just The Way You Are"
869,4,"This is a collection of mostly instrumental songs (the last cut \\""Stretch Limo\\"" has vocals). They're done in a variety of eclectic styles and moods, with a retro vibe to many of the songs and all show talented musicians laying back and having some fun. This is a different and offbeat set but if you like music that is not in the mainstream and unique, you may like this."
870,2,"I haven't listened to all of it yet, but what I have, the single is good, but just not stimulating listening any more. But because of his past, I buy every thing he ever does, anyway, so .... He has saturated us, the market, with this adult contemporary stuff. I really enjoyed Pilgrim, which critics generally trash, but I have to admit I don't even listen to any of his albums more than once, unless it's Cream, 461 Ocean Blvd, or my personal favorite, Slowhand. Songs like Motherless Children, Mainline Florida and The Core are unbeatable. These albums since Pilgrim seem all the same, and they're ok, but why not take a chance every other album? It seems he may be milking his fan base, which must be huge, and most of the comments seem to love or really like his current albums. Kudos to him for reinventing himself like no one else I can think of from his era, but it seems he could keep us all happy. 15 songs on current albums, certainly enough room to cover everything that people are asking from him. It makes me wonder where he's coming from, but I have and buy every album he has ever recorded, Bluesbreakers, Blind Faith (boring), Derek (best loud blues-rock album ever), B.B. King (fantastic), so it appears to me he is mailing it in at this point. This is no intellectual point of view, just a serious fan's opinions. Thanks to all who replied/reply."
871,5,"and judge this album strictly on it merits -(which I would like to think  is the definition of a  review )--then this Album is Great !!- I especially  enjoyed Jamie johnson's  Interpretation of Meat loaf's \\""Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad\\"" ----that song is worth the price off the album all by itself  ----"
872,5,"I have to admit that I couldn't appreciate the sound quality of this release until I upgraded my sound system. In fact, I didn't understand what all the fuss about Steve Hoffman's work was.    Honestly, I was missing the point - now I have to admit that I do hear it.    Most people reading this will be familiar with the songs so this review is mainly about the sound.    Spacious and a pleasing soundstage were not qualities I would have associated with Alice Cooper until hearing this. Well, no longer.  Right from the opening charge of \\""Under My Wheels\\"" the sound is terrific and surprisingly good for, well, Alice Cooper.    Bob Ezrin certainly knew what he was doing and went on to prove it for many years, perhaps culminating in Pink Floyd's \\""The Wall\\"".  He got his start with Alice and the boys and you can hear it on this very fine Audio Fidelity release.    After all, where else can you hear something like \\""Halo of Flies\\"" and be enthralled by the fine sound as well as its very 'dated' performance?  Not that there is anything wrong with that!     The best of the past with the best of the present.  Highly recommended!"
873,2,I personally found the Foundation to quite a bit better.  This one is Okay.
874,5,"I just have to say that I am greatly enjoying this new addition to the already terrific Satch collection.  I bought the CD in advance of its actual release, as purchasing any new-release Satriani CD for me is simply a given.  Joe Satriani is by far my favorite musician and I have been a huge fan of Joe's for many years (since the 'Not Of This Earth' era).  I find each of his CD's to be extremely enjoyable and unique.  In this CD and like always, Joe always gives a spectacular performance, and Joe's range of style does grow over time.  His work in this batch is definitely distinct and once again fantastic.    As always, you can immediately recognize Joe's incredible, uniquely exciting and astonishing guitar playing in all of the songs in this CD.  His technique, tone, composition quality, and expressive style are easily the most talented and musically developed in the world.  All of the songs on the CD are truly stunning in their sonics and feel.  I hear new things in these songs with almost every listen - the sonic layering and creative texturing is wonderful.      Some comments on specific songs from this CD: \\""Premonition\\"" is classic Joe and makes a great choice for the first-song for the CD.  \\""The Golden Room\\"" is jaw-droppingly good, and you will also notice that it is extremely aptly named!  \\""Dream Song\\"" is a genuine blast and will engage you right away.  \\""Pyrrhic Victoria\\"" is an extremely fun experience - and by its name, I imagine it perhaps describes the attitude of a woman he knows with a self-destructive ego?  \\""Littleworth Lane\\"" is a wonderful and bluesy piece that is just loaded with feeling.  \\""Wormhole Wizards\\"" is absolutely brilliant and seems almost alive in its soundspace!  \\""Light Years Away\\"" may describe the daydreaming sensation, and causes you to feel immersed in enjoyment of this song (the driving bass line is worth mentioning here as well).  \\""Solitude\\"" is a short but highly moving solo piece that will so capture your attention, it defies description.  \\""Two Sides To Every Story\\"" is a jazzy-rock gem that will definitely bring you a smile and make your feet tap.  \\""Wind In The Trees\\"" is mind-blowingly incredible, with literally the most amazing and emotionally moving guitar work I've possibly ever heard in my life.  \\""God is Crying\\"" is also just unbelievably good, another actual \\""touches your soul\\"" piece like the previously mentioned songs, and which Joe somehow so consistently produces.  I don't know how a human being can do this - somehow Joe is able to let his heart and soul genuinely sing and communicate through his guitar and compositions.  I can't believe how lucky we all are to be able to hear and experience this artist's invaluable gifts of music to the world.    When I bought this CD, I didn't know about the \\""Best Buy\\"" exclusive version which contains the two additional songs!  After hearing these songs online in MP3 version, I've since ordered the \\""Best Buy\\"" version CD so I can also have these two additional outstanding songs also in CD-quality.    I'm definitely (and obviously) happy as can be with this CD.  I also really appreciate the new bass work here of Allen Whitman, and Jeff Campitelli on drums is absolutely fantastic once again as well.  Both Joe Satriani and Mike Keneally each contributed to the keyboard elements on this CD (perhaps on all songs?).  At first, I wasn't quite sure about the subtly-new type of keyboard sound in this CD (Joe's earlier CD's often featured what I consider amazing sounding keyboard work also), but after several listens, I've come to truly appreciate how well this new sound integrates and undeniably contributes to these musical masterpieces in this CD.    Please Joe, keep releasing your amazing music, which as you know brings immeasurable enjoyment to myself and all of your many true fans.  Thank you so much!"
875,4,"I love Lin Yu Chun's voice but really, just 5 songs seems to be what the producer thinks is enough for American consumers.  I would love to continue to support Lin Yu Chun's career, but I will not buy any more CD's in the future.  Susan Boyle on the other hand, is receiving my total support and I am purchasing both her biography and her new CD.  Her CD's always have plenty of recordings on them.  Lin Yu Chun has an absolutely wonderful voice, but his producer offers poor value for the money."
876,5,"I've been a very big fan of the blues for over 50 years, and a very big fan of the \\""lonesome fiddle\\"" in country music, just as long, but I just found out about the Mississippi Sheiks, and all of these other groups, a few weeks ago.  Thank you, Elwood Blues, for devoting an entire 1-hour program to the Sheiks, and turning me on to this fabulous music.  If you are a blues aficionado, listen to Elwood's show.  It's available on-line at [...] on Sunday nights at 7:00 P.M. Pacific Time."
877,4,"Fans of The Misfits, The Ramones, The Adolescents and even solo material DANZIG will most likely dig this album. Nothing ground breaking as this is classic punk rock material, but songs are catchy and quite memorable...especially 'shes worshiping the devil' ...some of the best punk rock lyrics ever."
878,1,"It has been my previous experience that CD's that have censored lyrics carry an 'edited' notation. Be warned, Amazon does not list this disc as edited, but it is. 3 songs on 'The fame Monster' disc are edited. The 3 tracks that are censored are, 'Bad Romance', 'Monster', and 'Dance In The Dark'. Amazon should list this 2 disc set as edited, but they don't. Know what you are buying before you buy. Also of note, even the single disc is edited, unless it is the Australian import, which is virtually impossible to get your hands on."
879,1,"I've been waiting for her to release something.  Her first two albums were great.  Regularly still play her last one.  This album is quite different from the last two.  Another reviewer stated it was \\""smokey jazz, tinged with neo soul\\"".  I didn't hear all that.  What I mostly heard was a bunch of mid-tempo to slow popish cuts.  You can tell Janita was trying very hard to make an album that was very different from the last two.  The last two were livelier and upbeat with a bossa nova influence.  This one is just depressing.  Pretty much what I'm saying is this is another case of someone fixing something that wasn't broke."
880,5,"As their recorded legacy shows, Nice fans were always teased with portions of live shows on their various releases. Finally we get \\""the mother lode\\"" for Nice (as well as Keith Emerson fans), an entire show! These shows were recorded in December of 1969. These shows were taken from their last two shows to finish out their U.S. tour. The booklet is great for it details the history of the band. By this time, it was over for them as a group. Listening to this release you wouldn't know they were on the verge of a major split. Fortunately for us fans, their manager of the time had the engineer record the shows.    The shows were of high quality performance wise. This two cd set captures it so well. The Nice were a beast live and one listen to this and you'll really appreciate how great and talented they were. The mastering is excellent. Keith Emerson was amazing here but what really impressed me was Brian Davison's drumming.    You get an inspired version of \\""Rondo\\"" as well as \\""The Five Bridges Suite\\"" sans the Orchestra. It's a shame they didn't last too long. Shortly after these shows they went their separate ways and ELP were soon to be unleashed onto the world at large. If you're an ELP fan, get this and see where it all started. Thank you Virgin for finding these tapes and releasing them."
881,4,"Surf music, like punk and ska, is a very limited genre and most will end up getting annoyed and thinking that the music sounds too much the same. These are the same people who inexplicably hate Creed because 'all the songs sound the same', not because its bad. But if you like old Sci-Fi movies and or Mystery Science Theater 3000 (which Man or Astroman wrote the theme music for) then you will at listen enjoy a listen or two of any of Man or Astroman's stuff. Almost every track opens with some music or phrase from an old sci-fi movie. It's good stuff but can, admittedly, get a bit old after too many repeated listenings."
882,5,"This album harkens back to the early days of EBTG.  Soft, gentle and easy listening.  Not dance music with a bass thump.  Have not listened to the Berlin mixes yet."
883,5,"Phantom Power is the first and best (so far) Super Furry Animals CD I've bought. I heard \\""Slow Life\\"" and immediately logged onto Amazon to buy the CD. I thought it might be a one hit sorta thing but the entire album is freakin' awesome! BUY THIS CD!"
884,5,"Another fine effort by JJ Cale. This was his last album, released in 1983, before taking a long break from recording.<br /><br />It's a great album; highlights being: - \\""Money Talks\\"", \\""Hard Times\\"", \\""Unemployment\\"", \\""Trouble in the City\\"", \\""Teardrops in my Tequila\\"" (penned by Paul Craft) and \\""Livin' Here Too\\"".<br /><br />This is a darker album for JJ Cale and the album has a feel of \\""modern financial hardship blues\\"". This is blues for today and Cale's observational lyrics are balanced with his words of experience and involvement; all well suited to even the situation we have during this recession. They're quite refreshing to hear alongside our present apathetic song writers and music industry who consider an important subject to be trivial teenage angst or in making political waves provide an abundance of expletives that only encourage the general public to dismiss the song as a banal immature rant.<br /><br />The album was produced during a time when post punk/new wave was at its height and social comment through artistic and popular media was all the rage. This album still stands up both musically and lyrically and is one of my favourites of JJ Cale.<br /><br />To get a review of JJ Cale's body of work during his prolific era, to '83, see my review for \\""Shades\\""."
885,4,"If Pink Floyd made a chill soul album, and let Traffic sit in on a couple tracks, it might resemble something like Relayted.  Solid album all around, but a few parts get a little out there.  A step away from how we know Bon Iver, but great nonetheless."
886,5,"Outstanding album,the music is fresh,sensual and smooth,I really like this artist,every track is different, you can sense the passion behind every composition,I would recommend \\""Miami Sensual lounge\\"" by EDAY to anyone who likes real good music,a must have."
887,4,"Last Summer was a 1969 film staring Barbara Hershey and Richard Thomas, who was soon to birth John Boy Walton. This is basically a film about wayward youth circa the Woodstock era, and is a  great movie: particularly if you want to see a young Barbara Hershey tople...........just see the film.<br /><br />But even if you don't, get this soundtrack, which is by John Simon. His instrumental music here is inventive: check out the  opener's unlikely combo of early synthesizer and mandolin--it sounds on paper like a dumb 60s trick, but actually holds with its delicate space sound.<br /><br />Good as this is, the soundtrack could use more of it. Nothing on the rest of Last Summer is bad, but it does have the must of creaky rock assembled by studio bands--common practice for the era's soundtracks. This stuff has great nostalgia appeal, but next to, say, the music the Association did for [[ASIN:B0001WTWNI Goodbye, Columbus]], its legs tend to wobble.<br /><br />And if you doubt this quasi rock being a product of 1969, check out the name of the assembled band--Electric Meatball. Need I elaborate?"
888,1,"I Looove chick flicks, shoppin' at the mall with my BFFs (which are girls LOL!!), and chick singers.......but something stands out about Miley that I just can't explain!! Is it the generic background music? the generic lyrics? or the generic sex appeal used to sell her music? I DONT KNOW! but she is sure one talented musician.....the world needs more of her type of music......    Avoid terrible women singers like Doro, Blondie, Janis Joplin, Joan Jett, Mamas and Papas, the Carpenters, and especially Fleetwood Mac!!!!!!"
889,5,I'm so pleased with my new discovery. There will be tales for this guy similar to those for Muddy Waters.... Grate geniun Blues....  Love it....
890,5,This is an awesome CD!  I love this style of music and it is very interesting to listen to the different styles throughout the area.
891,3,I like about 4 songs on this CD.  I prefer the previous 2 twilight soundtracks than this one.
892,5,"I have been a fan of the Temps since I was a child. I came home from work and my wife said she had something for me. She handed me the CD. I looked at it and said I will listen to it later. I now wish I had opened it right then. This is the best album since Phoenix Rising. This is no slight on the albums between Phoenix and Still Here, this album is just that good.Singing in 5 part harmony never sounded so good."
893,1,"I do like most of the music on this CD - but the quality is terrible.  I got no insert with the CD's. . .  If I had not read the first review here, I would not even know who was singing and I don't know who is performing on the classical selections.  Isn't it illegal not to give credit to the performers?  Also, track 7 on disk 1 is not recorded and skipped over, also track 8.  Could I have gotten a defective disk????"
894,4,"Not quite as good as \\""Everything\\"", but still great to throw on for ambient \\""chill\\"" music."
895,5,"Hey, It's Carrie Underwood. She certainly knows how to sing. Good music to listen to."
896,2,"I've had this CD for years and pop it in occasionally. Its a pretty diverse compilation of some rather interesting stuff...more hard edged old school techno. Not particularly sophisticated, hard edged and up tempo. Its not one of of my faves..."
897,5,"Brilliant. No other word can describe this CD. I was at the recording of the CD and have seen Ryan many times live. This CD is a great example for all aspiring comedians in perfect stage craft, how to tell a joke, and how to hold an audiences attention with great call backs that make you tip over in your seat laughing! Highly recommend this CD to any fan of standup comedy."
898,5,"Love Like This is an amazing album. Every song is catchy and the lyrics are really relatable to most teenagers and even adults. The band put so much heart into their songs and it really shows when you listen to the music. I would suggest downloading \\""Young.\\"" That is one of my favorite songs off the record. Brian Dales, Jess Bowen, Stephen Gomez, John Gomez, and Josh Montgomery have created this amazing album and I'm proud to say that they are my favorite band. :)     - Kelsey"
899,5,"I am blown away by Adam Young and his creations, his electronic artistry. I started out hearing \\""Fireflies\\"" now and again on internet radio, and I kept thinking I need to remember that name and get that song. Months later I finally did and then bought the CD hoping it wasn't a one-hit wonder. I am a full-blown addict now. I would name my favorites but literally all the songs on here are so perfectly amazing to me that I listen to them constantly.<br /><br />I absolutely love the twists and turns that each song comes up with musically. All the little details are incredible and add up to pure perfection within each song. Each piece is layered with brilliant combinations of sounds and rhythms that work together so well I can't even describe it. It is pure magic for my ears. I would love to watch him create a song.<br /><br />I have read so many comments on comparing him to some group called Postal Service which I'd never heard of...but then I heard some of it recently and it was nowhere near Adam Young's quality. It was not musical at all and it wasn't nearly as smooth or magical or beautiful. I like everything from classical to heavy metal but Owl City is something so new and sweet to me it makes me happy.<br /><br />There are some wonderful romantic lyrics as well, I have to add. This album is the most refreshing thing to come along for me in ages. 100 stars to Adam Young!"
900,5,"I first discovered this \\""still\\"" young ukulele player from Hawaii by hearing a track on an \\""acoustic\\"" sampler. That track, \\"" Ukulele Boogie\\"" from her 2nd CD titled \\""Hear\\"" grabbed my attention, and I had to hear more. This led me to three of her CDs - recorded over a period of thee years. But these were formative years for this young prodigy and each CD has a different style - though all are worth hearing.<br /><br />This album - from 2005 - was recorded when she was just 17. Not only does she play incredible ukulele. But she overdubs herself on bass, guitar and keyboards! The drums are the only instrument played here by someone else. The opening track - Dave Brubeck's \\""Take Five\\"" - tells you off the bat that this is not your father's (or grandfather's) Hawaiian uke album. Sure there a few Hawaiian related tracks but more in a pop and jazz style. The Peruvian- influenced song \\""El Condor Pasa\\"" - made popular in the 70s by Simon & Garfunkel (and played by every pan-pipe band you can find) fits in nicely too. And then there's that \\""Ukulele Boogie\\"" that originally grabbed me!  For person of this young age - at the time she recorded it - this shows some talent.  The last track is unique departure. Brittini appears to be a very religious person and here she not only plays, but sings, the Hebrew lyrics to a well-known prayer from the bible.<br /><br />Of the three Brittni CDs I've heard this is still , hands down, the one I like best and play the most.<br /><br />I've covered three of Brittni's albums here on Amazon. You can search the others for my comments on those. But, overall this a a very talented young woman with a lot of creativity and musicianship. And she's only 22 this year! I can only wonder where she'll take her music on future releases. I hope I'm along for the journey.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\""Anything Phonographic\\"""
901,5,Their best album. Although return of saturn was great also. I can't believe this album is 15 years old. WTF. I remember going to see Bush and No Doubt opened with the Goo Goo Dolls. Time flys!
902,1,"This vinyl record was ordered thru Clubmgdvdsales, a secondary merchant and the experience was the first time I've had SO much trouble via Amazon. The record was to arrive May 26 (nearly a month after I placed the order on May 4!!--also very unusual). Since it was a gift for my granddaughter, I began to e-mail them on May 28. NO ANSWER to any of my 3 e-mails as to what the problem might be. I never got the record and I hope they did not charge my credit card. I would definitely not recommend this merchant, as their service was TERRIBLE and no response to my e-mails was certainly poor customer service. I had to resort to an entirely different merchant who dealt w/eBay and was a more time-consuming process. Have yet to receive the record from him, but he responded to e-mails in a very timely, courteous, and informative way. Do not deal w/this merchant thru Amazon, Clubmgdvsales, as you will be very unhappy w/their service. Cannot recommend this merchant. Service was AWFUL!!"
903,4,"The sound on this under rated Devo classic has been cleaned up considerably bringing it out of the muffled fog it was originally in. The clarity is much noticed on \\""Through Being Cool\\""<br /><br />I like the extra tracks. They might be found on other Devo releases, but I don't mind them here. I like them especially \\""One Dumb Thing\\"" which, from what I understand, eventually was rewritten as \\""PATTERNS\\"" on \\""Oh, No! It's Devo!\\""  It's neat hearing how a song was...then eventually ended up as. I do miss \\""Working In A Coal Mine\\"" on this release even though it's not one of my favorite Devo songs.<br /><br />The mark on the front \\""Parental Advisory Explicit Content\\"" I feel was placed there for a marketing ploy. Anyone who is familiar with the original release knows there is nothing more than Benny Hill naughty boy type humor here as in \\""Soft Things\\"". But possibly, if a consumer had not heard the extras before might think they are something REALLY naughty included there.<br /><br />Over all, great price, great cd, great bonus tracks, GREAT DEVO RELEASE!"
904,1,"Here we go again. Last time it was Perfect Symmetry with all the 80's synthesizers and a couple of nice songs. This time it an EP with one song that is Ok. \\""My Shadow\\"" is not a bad song but it is far beneath the quality songs on the first two cd's. As another reviewer stated have we lost this band to this old sound? These songs are forgettable and that is being kind. The rap song is a joke. It might have been a good song if it was just Tom singing it without a rap beat. Again, no piano from Tim or drums from Richard. Just computer generated tripe.What is with the theme music from the \\""Rocky' movie? How far do these guys have to fall before they pick themselves up and start making music that means something again. They used to write songs for the heart and now they just write for your feet. I borrowed that phrase from someone on Keane's website and they are absolutely right."
905,5,"Wow its great to hear this band again. I listened to them on WNKU the other day,and I was hooked. I heard \\""what I'm famous for\\"".I downloaded the album the next day, and I havent looked back."
906,5,"Transportation :: Originally released in 1988 & Billy Currie's first solo effort, this album has been knowingly and lovingly crafted, taking on a strong theatrical stance.     \\""Transportation\\"" sums up the whole record - it's vast, majestic, wild and remote. Billy plays the piano with incredible intent here, creating phrases which contrast later with the more subtle parts of the track. An incredible journey, true of the whole album and not just its title track, with some stunning guitar parts courtesy of guest Steve Howe [Yes]. Listen carefully as \\""Transportation\\"" resolves with a short violin section and you will hear \\""The Ascent.\\"" Ultravox continue to stir the undercurrent of some fast moving waters - Billy's loving relationship with the keys during \\""Rackaia River\\"" at one point contain traces of \\""Astradyne.\\""     \\""Perfect Flight\\"" oozes pure passion - the whole feel of this track has an underlying sexy connotation, and its soulful presence sits well in a swanky New York cocktail bar.     Every track on here shimmers with artistic richness resulting in a work that's both eccentric and adventurous.     Some would say it's extreme, in that it can push the boundary of every musical continent, but I urge you to go the distance - it actually makes for a very workable and memorable round trip."
907,4,"Another excellent piece of work from Phil Naro. You can't go wrong buying any of his CDs. I'd highly recommend this, and any other, of his releases. It's good old fashioned rock & roll with just the right amount of \\""modern-esque\\"" edge to it."
908,5,"Stokowski had just turned 9 when the bulk of this concert from Albert Hall was recorded (the Novacek item is from ten years earlier).  He retained is control and style, and the only sign of age was a tendency to rush, as if to make sure the audience knew how vigorous he remained. In every respect the program is a revisit to strength -- Stokowski had always been a master at Ravel and Vaughan Williams. Because of his famous string sonority, based on free bowing, it's no wonder that the Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis is as rich as warm butterscotch. But there's also good rhythmic control, so the long melodic lines never become droopy or soupy. The only flaw is that dynamics remain on the same, fairly loud plane, neglecting the rise from hushed softness to climactic grandeur that  shows the work off at its best.<br /><br />In Ravel Stokowski never attempted to imitate the French; he has his won coloristic style, bolder and brighter. The pure Gallic idiom belongs to Martinon and Monteux, and Karajan extracted unbelievable refinement, but Stokowski's Rapsodie espagnole has more inner life and drama than either.<br /><br />The detailed liner notes point out that Klemperer and Stokowski were poles apart as conductors, which hardly needs saying, but more surprisingly that the unbending, forbidding Klemperer admired the publicity hound and Disney movie star Stokowski. Klemperer was a composer, and his only semi-popular work, the cheerful, echt Viennese Merry Waltz, makes a touching start to the program, in tribute to Klemperer, who has died the summer before at 88.<br /><br />The main work, the Brahms fourth, lies outside Stokowski's kingdom; he played the German classics but never made Mozart, Beethoven, or Brahms the center of fascination, and except for the Schumann Second, he avoided tht composer's music on disc. In his glory years with Philadelphia he was bold enough to pull Brahms in strange directions, but in general Stokowski was respectful.  His arc rival Toscanini had set a fashion for quick, even hectic tempos, and this performance of the Fourth Sym. is in that mold, although Stokowski is more relaxed, even at high speed. The reading has plenty of vigor and extroverted energy but is short, perhaps, on careful phrasing and emotional depth. Happily Stokwski brings sweep and excitement to the finale, and one can't help but be touched, realizing that this was his next to last public concert. the last came a year later in Rouen when he conducted some of is signature Bach transcriptions. Valuable as a memento, this CD also captures in 78 min. a satisfying vision of Stokowski's art. The bBC's stereo sound is excellent, with a suggestion of the spacious reverberation heard in the immense London hall.r quick, even hectic tempos, and this performance of the Fourth Sym. is in that mold, although Stokowski is more relaxed, even at high speed.

911,4,"To be honest on my first few listens this CD did not sound good compared to previous Sade work.  However, I gave it a chance, after all, I paid for it.  Well, now I love it.  Give it time.  The music is so mellow at times that you forget to listen to the rich interplay going on with the excellent artists.  But, the guitar, sax, bass, keyboards, and other instruments are still being played by great musicians, and of course, Sade's vocals are unique and have a beauty of their own.      When I first heard Sade (and saw the band live) I loved the music.  That music is here too.  Perhaps not to the previous levels, no \\""Is It A Crime?\\"" here. Yet, satisfying. My favorites on this CD are \\""The Moon and the Sky\\"", \\""Long Hard Road\\"", \\""Bring me Home\\"", and \\""Skin\\"".       Funny when I listen the the beginning of \\""Long Hard Road\\"" I expect one of Bob Dylan's songs to follow, but I can't place it.  Maybe it is \\""One More Cup of Cup of Coffee\\"" from the Desire CD?    -- JB"
912,5,"I used to ignore most genres outside of hip hop many years back. The only reason I ever started listening to 3rd wave ska was because I fell in love with the song Superman by Goldfinger, that was featured the the video game Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. So I figured, \\""Hey, I'll just type in 'greatest ska albums ever' into google and see which band I should look into.\\"" I randomly picked Streetlight Manifesto because it had the coolest name to me and bought Everything Goes Numb off of Amazon. And to be honest, I HATED this album when I first got it. I even regretted buying it. Oh, what a fool I was......<br /><br />After multiple listens, I realized what a gem this album truly is and now I can fully appreciate it. The instrumentation is amazing, and Tomas Kalnoky beats most rappers, except maybe the top 5, when it comes to lyrical ability. Trust me, look up his lyrics on [...] and read along with the songs. When you finally decipher what he's saying, you just sit back and go, \\""wow.\\"" After finding this album, no other ska album period has ever come to topping this record. Not Reel Big Fish, not Aquabats, not Big D, not Bosstones, not No Doubt, not Operation Ivy, not suicide machines, not any of those bands. Streetlight just has that original sound that sets it apart from a typical 3rd wave ska band. TBH, it's in my top 5 of all time, only being topped by certain hip hop albums that shaped my childhood (illmatic, resurrection, marshall mather's lp). I hold it ahead of any rock album iv'e listend to, including bands like weezer and led zep, who I love. This album is THAT GOOD.<br /><br />1) Everything Went Numb - 9/10: Great intro to the album.<br />2) That'll Be the Day - 10/10: One of my favorite songs on the album. The chorus will be stuck in your head for days on end. Closer examination of the lyrics will bring some worthy lines to light, exemplifying Kalnoky's genius songwriting<br />3) Point/Counterpoint - 9/10: A sequel to Keasbey Nights by Catch 22, Tomas's old band.

You'll to read the lyrics for this one...<br />9) Moment of Silence - 10/10: Another one of my favorites. This song slows down the pace a bit. But it's for the better!

913,4,I'm a big fan of nightnoise but I prefer their studio efforts to this live recording. Nevertheless it is interesting to hear the contrast between their live and studio recordings
914,5,"john hiatt is an american musical heritage, an artist who  is always recording and releasing top quality albums. his catalog is full of them several are masterpieces such as walk on. hiatt is a literary genuis in the mold of tennessee williams or james dickey. the open road takes its place alongside his other great albums. its songs are the stories of rugged individuaist who have come of age and are still rebels of the great american century. the sound is as gritty as the stories and the singer. most music today doesn't have a quality about it but john hiatts songs always do. john hiatt is a true american treasure and he keeps on giving, buy this album and listen to walk on if you haven't heard it. discover john hiatt!"
915,5,just like i remembered it! lost my orig. copy and this was in perfect condition.
916,4,"Toothbrush was an interesting view into the early work of our beloved Dr. Dog. It's a lot rougher than Easy Beat (their next cd in progression) and a little less collected. None the less, its easy to hear the familiar song writing styles of the band (and how much acid they've taken over the years!) and there are several strong tracks including Mystery To Me, The ABC's and How Dare. I really didn't like Swamp Livin'"
917,4,"Bought this for my hubby, as he loves the Blue Collar Comedy tour and hasn't bought any of the individual comics' recordings. A nice introduction to the Blue Collar Comedy team. Bought through Amazon Marketplace for an inexpensive and fun gift."
918,5,"Byron Fry is an amazing musician tilting the scales to the extreme when it comes to musical talent. Not only does he have \\""flying fingers\\"" but he also shows a great deal of expression and control through his music.     As a fellow musician I have looked up to Byron for years, watching him pass the rest of us by with a talent level worthy of the greatness he exudes when he plays.    I have had the priveledge of listening to his awesome music cuts on some of the various projects he has worked on. I can tell you first-hand that this is an album that goes into the \\""must have\\"" category. I am ordering mine today!    Keep up the good work, Mr. Byron Fry...we look forward to your next album!"
919,5,I bought this CD to introduce my 5 yr. old to some different music that I could also listen to.  He loved it!  It has some really great songs on the CD and we will be listening to it as a family for a long time to come.  It will definitely be with us on our long road trip this summer.
920,5,"Haggar has his moments,and to me this was one of his finest.Right up there with Standing hampton.Schones guitar playing is ungodly on this one of album these guys did for charity work.This is the second time ive owned it."
921,4,"I bought this because I saw the music school where it was recorded when I was in Budapest, and was thinking it perhaps was a production by the students (I don't know if that's true). They really do a good job, although they're not quite as full-throated as experienced professional singers.<br /><br />The technical quality of the recording leaves much to be desired. It has the raspy overtones I describe in more detail in my review of the Lassus masses.<br /><br />I'd say buy it if you have a hankering to listen to Cosi in your car and want to save some money, but it's nowhere near the quality of the Telarc set with Jerry Hadley.<br /><br />Update on 12/23/11, almost two years later:<br /><br />On rehearing this set and reconsidering my rating, I'm awarding it an additional star, going from 3 to 4. This is a live recording and, as live recordings go, it suffers from relatively fewer of the usual ambient noises and less of the thin sound. But it still exhibits some of those typical shortcomings. I'm guessing that for this one they had the singers holding microphones.<br /><br />I thought the pace was a little too fast in place, but that's a matter of taste, and I can understand why the conductor would choose this pace. It simply differs from what I am used to, which is not to say it's incorrect at all.<br /><br />I think these relatively unknown singers have done a superb job, and this Budapest audience, most of which are characteristically hard to please, seems to agree. Their reaction is thunderously effusive, you can hear \\""bravos\\"" and you can almost hear the bouquets landing on the lip of the stage.<br /><br />As far as the raspy noise goes, I'm gradually coming to the conclusion that it's an artifact of my electronic equipment, although a less-than-ideal recording doesn't help much. I'm guessing that this recording is one such, and that the original recording sampling rate was not as high as that of, say, DGG, Decca or EMI, and that no smoothing processing was done between the either the first or second pair of D's in the DDD.<br /><br />So,  bottom line; it's a decent recording of a group of highly spirited relative unknowns. It's worth a listen and well worth the price of one of the used sets.So,  bottom line; it's a decent recording of a group of highly spirited relative unknowns.

922,5,"I love this CD - it has the rough purity of her earlier blues, including Finest Lovin' Man and my all-time favourite: Women Be Wise.  This version of WBW was recorded with Sippie Wallace in 1976. And how can you beat Angel From Montgomery, which she did live with John Prine."
923,4,"An all star project with members of Pharaoh, Manticora, Division & Redemption.  This took a few listens to sink in, but eventually you hear the killer songwriting ideas.  The music is melodic power/prog styling with intelligent lyrics (that actually includes some of Edgar Allan Poe's work). Just catchy stuff with a super rhythm section & lead fretwork from Matt Johnsen (Pharaoh)on guitar! If you are a fan of any of the above noted bands in all liklihood you will gravitate to this album."
924,4,"Oh Calcutta! was a Braodway Musical in 1969. It explored exclusively sex, when people were JUST starting to talk about tastes, fetishes, homosexuality and prematerial sex in public. The performers were nude  on stage.<br /><br />Musically, this opens with  wonderfully psychadelic, shimmering varations on a theme. It is like watching a dark tie-dye snake change shape.<br /><br />This is, of course, a musical. It is NOT rock, although the songs have rock tinges. A lot are basic show tunes--pretty hip for the time, this is not My Fair Lady--but concious story-telling vehicles. Not bad, but not as great as the first track. For my tastes. this then-edgey musical could have been a lot more psychadelic.<br /><br />There is probably a lot on HBO that you would not see in Oh Calcutta: but we're talking about a time when married couples could not be in the same bed on TV. For all the counterculture and hippy stuff, America was still a very morally conservative place 1969.<br /><br />And that made Oh Calcutta truely edge."
925,5,"\\""Cajun House Party\\"" is an accurate description of these sessions recorded in 1979, some of these songs were recorded in the late fifties by Dr. Harry Oster. Arhoolie introduces Wallace \\""Cheese\\"" Read vocalist/fiddle player, Read plays the traditional Bayou sounds of the truest caliber, backed by top-notch musicians throughout, with accordion, triangle, all the essential tools needed. Read is one of the better vocalist of the genre and plays a fiddle that cuts notes like a knife, Read and Dewey Balfa combined would've made golden twin fiddles. There's twenty nine songs here, seventy eight minutes of classic Cajun music, with mostly French lyrics, although half of Little Richard's \\""Keep A Knockin'\\"" is sung in English, Johnny Horton's \\""Battle Of New Orleans\\"" is an instrumental, a different approach is taken for this country standard. Loaded with waltzes and two steps, this is also good listening with your favorite beverage. Wallace \\""cheese\\"" Read's Cajun House Party, \\""it's much better than good\\"". Read's music is very limited like most great Cajun artist, you'll hear more of this unique musician on \\""Folksongs Of The Louisiana Acadians\\"", also on Arhoolie. (just can't get my fill of this unique recording. Wallace Read must be one of the most underrated musician's of all time, it's too bad, like Nathan Abshire, both men weren't able to make music for a living.)"
926,5,"Matthias Goerne has a large fan base and much critical acclaim, but even with these advantages and his honeyed voice, it's risky to record a dozen Schubert CDs. He won't be covering every song suitable for the male voice, as Fischer-Dieskau did for DG, so completists won't be attracted on that score. The artistry of each installment will have to speak for itself. So far, it has, and using different pianists as collaborators has helped leaven the sameness of the first four editions. This time we get the noted German conductor Ingo Metzmacher, who proves to be capable and thoroughly musical, if not exactly a revelation. The theme centers on the ancient world of Greece (or Griechenland as the first, haunting song has it).<br /><br />I'm no specialist, but as a lover of Schubert lieder, I recognized as old favorites about a third of the songs presented here, and about an equal number were completely new, including the paired Heliopolis songs, D. 753 and D. 754, that give the album its title. I am an on-again, off-again fan of Goerne's smooth, creamy delivery, and having heard him now in over a hundred lieder since the series began, I find it harder to find much variety. Yet I must hasten to add that this is singing of a very accomplished order -- it's not as if Goerne has to worry about close rivals except for a veteran like Thomas Hampson. I wish he weren't so eternally serious, to the point of grimness, in this repertoire. Schubert has lightness as one of his main characteristics, but Goerne is never carefree, even when Schubert is. The cursed Orestes is meat for him, or any song that's tragic, gloomy, declamatory, or lamenting.<br /><br />In short, Goerne likes to stay on the dark side, and as a result, his Schubert can grow wearisome. Take his intense artistry a few songs at a time, and you find an exceptional singer enjoying the fruits of his maturity."

928,5,I have always been a S.V. fan and bought this CD on a whim. What an unexpected surprise! I think this is her best work ever. It just seems more refined and more diversified than her other work and it is her only CD in which I like every song. If you like S.V. and don't have this CD-GET IT!

930,5,"If you like Ronnie Montrose, definitely get this disc. RM's playing is superb, as always, on the six tracks he plays on (four original and two remixes). But don't just listen to those tracks. You might be surprised that you end up liking some of the others more. In particular, listen to \\""Saltation\\"" and \\""Silicone Rose\\"".    I discovered Anti-M by searching for Ronnie Montrose. But Anti-M is more than just a band Ronnie Montrose \\""helped out\\"" by playing on some tracks. He obviously saw the talent this group possesses. His guitar meshes well with the instrumentation and vocals Anti-M generates.    And if you want more info, check out the Anti-M website.

Unfortunetly with the likes of the overrated singers (Beyonce, Rihanna, and Mariah) she hasnt had the chance to shine. Fortunetly, she does not disappoint this album like the last three albums. \\""In Love And War\\"" is daring, its edgy, its different, its real. My favorites on here are Dangerous (Very addictive!), Why R U, Pretty Brown Eyes (Nice duet with another Underrated singer Trey Songz), More Than Love, and Swag Back (This is a hardcore track, there is confidence oozing all through this one!). Dear John has next single written all over it, but its still a great song. Thank you Amerie for STILL putting out quality CDs even though its been hard.

937,5,"Yo what's da business. So of course it's me BabyBoy here once again commenting on my girl Rasheeda's new album \\""Certified Hot Chick\\"". This is her best work yet. I have been following Rasheeda since she stepped in the scene with her starting group Da Kaperz and she has grown so much since then. With this album, she made it very fun to listen to and every track has it's own meaning and something anybody can relate to. And for anybody who does not know who Rasheeda is, then you need to step it up and get with the program and get ALL of her cds (Da Kaperz, Dirty South, A Ghetto Dream, Georgia Peach, Dat Type Of Gurl, and now Certified Hot Chick). As I said before, Rasheeda you keep doing yo thang lil mama and f*** dem haterz who want to hold you down. Nothing but love from the VA."

940,5,"Iron Maiden was hitting their stride as the world's premier heavy metal band when they released their fifth album, `Powerslave' in late summer 1984. Arguably this record could be considered the last of their classic era and was also the first to feature an unchanged lineup for consecutive records (a lineup that persists to this day with the addition of Janick Gers). Many consider `Powerslave' to be the definitive Maiden opus, and though I prefer the two previous records, it would hard to argue that `Powerslave' isn't their best. The album seemed to represent a true culmination of each band member's individual strengths. The songwriting was challengingly progressive as you would expect from Steve Harris, but Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith rose to the occasion as well and now all of Maiden's chief composers were working at the peak of their powers as the cracks in the `armour' would not appear for another six years. True metal classics include the powerhouse one-two punch of \\""Aces High\\"" and \\""2 Minutes to Midnight\\"". As a perfect bookend, the LP closes with \\""Powerslave\\"" and \\""Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\"", two more in Iron Maiden's unchallenged onslaught through the Eighties! In between you have capable if not excellent metal with not one but two odes to mano a mano, \\""Flash of the Blade\\"" and \\""Duelists\\"". The harmonies woven by Murray and Smith weave a profound tapestry over which Dickinson gives his trademark wail with the rumbling of one of metal's all-time greatest rhythm sections. Maiden's reach would not overextend their grasp as they proved with another metal touchstone in `Powerslave'. In the abyss I fall, the eye of Horus..."

944,5,"Excellent interpretations and performance of traditional Irish songs.  A must-have for anyone who appreciates Irish music.  This collection has a broad enough variety (e.g. songs of love, songs of conflict/war, of English oppression [subtle of course], immigration etc.) that the lyrics alone could help re-tell Irish history since the 1700s.  Program notes are highly informative, especially for some individual pieces.  This album has enough popular and familiar Irish folk songs to please any casual listener.  Emily Mitchell is a rare, superb musician, able to imbue great beauty to these songs with voice and harp.  Her performance is so compelling that I have bought a total of three copies of this CD title (one to play, one as archive copy, to replace a lost first copy purchased nearly a decade ago)."
945,1,"I checked this CD out from my local library.  I'm a big Nigel Kennedy fan, but the engineering on this CD is just awful.  The violin sounds very unnatural.  The overall sound is quite lackluster.  Unfortunate, because it gets in the way of a pretty good performance."

947,4,Great CD.  Like just about all of the songs on the CD.  DVD is entertaining. Highly recomended.
948,5,"The Chopin Nocturnes, if they are to show their best as a set, require both a strong confident intelligence and a heightened poetic gift for bringing out and spinning a melodic line. Ms Pires lacks nothing of either precious quality, and with a musical sensibility second to none she gives us these wonderful performances of the Nocturnes.<br /><br />Note: There is also a DG version of this Decca 2 Cd set in Europe. The performances are the same, not new ones made for DG. In actual fact, the Decca version is actually originally from DG. To confuse things further, this under review Decca set was also offered as a special Gramophone set with differing cover! For good measure DG also uses two different covers for their European release - no doubt just to baffle us all to the edge of drink. These DG sets may be found from some stateside sources - but don't worry - Pires recorded the full set of Nocturnes just once. But be careful - one of the two European sets covers is now used in the States for a single Cd of selections! [[ASIN:B0013816GA Chopin: Nocturnes]] I have not heard all these various incarnations, so who knows if the most recent version, the DG European one, has been tweaked. Confused? I know I am!<br /><br />Rather than adding on to the couple dozen reviews, many quite good, I'd like to respond to a less than glowing 3 star rating by one 'Customer Reviewer', a reviewer of some erudition and knowledge of both pianists and Chopin. It is a very good review, well thought out, and not beholden to the critical bandwagon. But I do differ on the reviewer's take on a couple points, so I'll put in my two cents worth.<br /><br />Our mystery \\""Customer\\"" Reviewer's taste and we might even say preference for the highly dramatic is made quite clear by the Nocturnes and performers chosen for comparison. I agree that it is undoubtedly true that Ms Pires does not equal the very best versions of the Nocturnes in the examples chosen, nor, I might add, in several others not mentioned. However, it is baseless to suggest Pires' set as a whole falls short because her way in a particular Nocturne comes up short of the best ever recorded! The same complaint might be lodged without any prejudice against ANY set of the Nocturnes - and by this I do not leave out either Ms Noaves, nor Mr. Rubinstein; for the former has plenty of moments among her performances of the Nocturnes that fall short of Ms Pires' consistently high standards of playing, while even the redoutable old lion Rubinstein can be taken to task here and there - I find the latter's unbridled athletic romps sometimes more suitable for the music of Anton Rubinstein than Frederic Chopin.<br /><br />Where Pires excels, as the reviewer rightly points out, is in Chopin's cantabile passages, in her handling of rubato. Customer reviewer describes this exceptional quality of Pires' playing quite well, but how troubling that he should then proceed to diminish its importance by going on to suggest that Pires falls short in imagination. Customer reviewer's bold assertion that Pires fails to grasp the requirements implicit in the mature Nocturnes because her great gift at putting over a melody leaves her back in the world of Field's Nocturnes is quite incredible. Ms Pires' art is light years beyond the demands of the Irish composer, and quite capable of handling late Chopin - see her most recent Cd - [[ASIN:B001J662OW Chopin]]<br /><br />Chopin was stronly influenced by Bellini, and the famous opera composer wrote music demanding a constant and solid underpining for his unparalled flight of arioso. Now, a pianist like Kissin, so praised by the customer reviewer for one performance of a Nocturne, admittedly a most provocative performance, is also prone - when heard in a large sample as is the case here with Pires - to impose his own extraneous and arbitrary elements quite in opposition to the music's clearly stated notation. Kissin is particularly susceptible to losing his foundation as he weaves hither and thither in admittedly remarkable pieces of showmanship. Impossibly uncertain rhtyhmic pulses, totally out of place when taken to excess, dissolve the crucial classicism underlying all Chopin's best music. I find it troubling that so mature an artist as Pires is to be chastised in preference for such an inconsistent and frequently self-indulgent one as Kissin.<br /><br />It is Pires' deft handling of Chopin's formal requirements that is so winning; she combines a sure rock steady sense of pulse while simultaneously uses a highly 'imagaintive' rubato in imparting life and variety to the remarkably suggestive melodic lines. She does so throughout all these performances, bringing a very high standard of artistry to each work. It is this overall richness, as well as her singular gift at singing Chopin's music with as fine a sense for the proper use of rubato as any living pianist that makes this set a winner.<br /><br />Finally some sharp words. I am growing very tired of all this \\""tiny hands\\"" and \\""technical limitations\\"" chatter dumped casually on Pires. The reality is that there are few pianists alive today who can play a scale as evenly as Pires, and fewer still with her gift for melody. And in sveral highly technical matters, pires aquits herself with very high marks.<br /><br />Anyone still not convinced Ms Pires lacks the necessary Romantic Imagination should hear her in the Schubert Impromptus. And yes, Schubert is a Romantic! [[ASIN:B000001GZY Maria João Pires - Le Voyage Magnifique ~ Schubert Impromtus]]ble pieces of showmanship.

949,5,A classic recording that has never been bettered. David Willcocks's setting of Psalm 51 in English to Allegri's famous chant is superb. It's almost as if the music were written for the English rather than the original Latin version. And you can follow the words in the Prayer Book or Bible.
950,4,"I've only used this CD a small handful of times already, but I'm very satisfied.  I like using various tempos, and having options for combinations (e.g. having multiple center tendu tracks to choose from depending on what I want to accomplish that day).  Also, I like the tempo changes in the tendu and degage combinations at the barre.  All of the tracks are pleasant, and beautifully done.  The CD was clearly made for intermediate/advanced ballet classes, I wouldn't recommend using it for beginner-level classes.<br />The only issue I have are the couple of spelling errors on the CD cover of the names of the various tracks.  For example, \\""Ronde de Jambe\\"" is spelled \\""Rond\\"" without the 'e' at the end.  I'm very particular when it comes to spelling in general, and as someone who has a degree in dance, I've become the same way with ballet terminology.  Other than the spelling errors, I have no complaints!"
951,2,"John Fonville, the flute soloist on Transfigured Wind II is quite good.  Sollberger and the San Diego Symphony Ensemble do a nice job on the performance, too.  The computer generated tape was masterfully created by Reynold's graduate student TA's although they received no credit for the thousands of hours that they put into the project.  \\""Whispers Out of Time\\"" won a Pulitzer Prize and is quite an ugly work - formless, void, ponderous, uninteresting.  Roger Reynolds is a legend in his own mind, without the ears or imagination of a decent journeyman musician.  Nonetheless, the disc is worth getting just for Fonville and Transfigured Wind II which is an excellent work.  I guess that even a broken clock is right twice a day!"
952,5,"Like at least one other reviewer I also consider G. Jones the finest country singer alive (or dead), so it's a huge relief to finally have this first collection of Jones' Musicor recordings, with the second also now available. I can't really comment about the sound, as I've mostly been listening in the car, but I wouldn't dismiss the listed opinion regarding the possibility of less-than-pristine master tapes from which Bear Family produced these CD's. In any case, the sound seems fine to me, without really anything to compare except for all those dubious Dutch and Spanish CD's of Musicor material, whose sound was sometimes awful. It seems to me that Bear Family has done the best (as they almost always do) with the source material(s) they have. I'm another one who is somewhat put off by the lukewarm sometimes condescending tone of Rich Kienzle in his notes. I've always enjoyed Kienzle's writing and I have great respect for his country music historical knowledge, but one significant aspect of George Jones' artistry has totally escaped Kienzle, and that is Jones' ability to elevate the material, to make a mediocre song good and a good song absolutely great. Come on, Rich! Calling \\""Flowers for Mama\\"" \\""bathos-plagued,\\"" and complaining about Jones' recitation in the song?? Referring to \\""I Just Lost My Favorite Girl\\"" as a \\""flat ballad?\\"" Country Music was built on emotionally raw, maudlin songs like this and Jones proves his magnificence as a singer by carrying off these songs and many such others in this set. I hope no-one is discouraged from buying this set by my or any other review ... No one in country music history, and few other singers of any other genre can match the combination of raw emotion and assured grace which George Jones brings to a song. In terms of percentage, there is probably more good/great material here than on the UA set (also strongly recommended, nevertheless.)"
953,5,"This penultimate album (to date) of Lightfoot continues to show why Lightfoot has lasted so long.  His lyrics indeed paint vivid pictures for the listener as he or she follows along the autobiographical title track.  Lightfoot's voice is--forgive me Lightfoot fans--a bit withered in this album, but he matches the tinnier sound of his voice with the lyrics that take the listener for a wonderful ride that expresses his views based on a long, fruitful life.  Don't look for the deep powerful voice you heard on SUNDOWN or CAREFREE HIGHWAY, but do listen to the deep, wonderful, even colorful lyrics that this bard has provided us for the last 40 years or so."
954,5,"This disc, which came out about a year ago, is absolutely marvelous.  Before it goes into the dustbin of history, I want to give it its proper respect.    The concept of this album is linked, at least in title, with Yusef Lateef's Detroit, an album from the late '60's.  I have never listened to that album, but I did hear some it live.  In any case, this disc is a homage to Gerald Cleaver's hometown.    There are several outstanding aspects to this music.  It is very diverse, sounding at times like some of the great Blue Note albums of the '60's (Soul Station, Maiden Voyage, Black Fire, etc.), at times like early McCoy Tyner (particularly Extensions), at times like Charles Mingus at his best, and at times like ultra-modern free jazz.  Despite this variety, there seems to be a unifying thread running through all of the music.    The players and the playing are outstanding throughout.  Jeremy Pelt and J.D. Allen are outstanding on trumpet and tenor sax, respectively.  They are two of the brightest talents in modern jazz.  Gerald Cleaver is an excellent drummer, holding everything together yet still engaging the listener with his inventive and varied technique.  I was unfamiliar with Ben Waltzer (piano) and Chris Lightcap (bass) before this disc, but each makes a terrific contribution.  Waltzer's chameleon-like ability to shift styles yet continually define the parameters of the music is amazing.  Andrew Bishop provides multiple instruments, including bass clarinet (a homage to Benny Maupin) and soprano sax.  On several tunes, the theme is stated by just soprano sax and trumpet, a unique, interesting, and engaging sound.      My favorite tunes are Far East Side, Henry, Dorham, and Detroit (keep it in mind).  I don't know why marching bands across America don't put Detroit (keep it in mind) in their repertoire, as it is both anthemic and upbeat.  In the spirit of full disclosure, I grew up on the Far East Side of Detroit, but that has not biased my view that that tune isthe best on the disc.  It opens with a disparate variety of free jazz playing, and then coalesces around a compelling (Ron Carter-esque) bass line.  It is also perfect how the music fades into The Silly One, which opens with a Maupinesque statement by the bass clarinet.    After repeated listenings, this music never fails to be thought-provoking, always leaves me wanting more, and always lifts my spirits.  You cannot go wrong by buying this disc!"
955,5,"I agree with an above poster. I didn't buy this album to \\""drool\\"" over. I wanted to listen and enjoy his music not analyze his life or even think about his passing. Just enjoy the tracks on this record. 2 songs I liked weren't included they were , The Jacksons \\""Torture\\"" and MJ's 2001 song \\""2000 Watts\\"". But I got most of those from the net. I liked some of MJ's songs but only knew the most popular ones prior to his passing. Since his passing and thanks to a tribute of MJ songs played on XM Satellite Radio. I now enjoy more songs than ever before. I know most think that people like me ONLY bought this record because of the hype. That isn't true if you never liked MJ's music than regardless of the hype you won't all of the sudden like his music. You have to be a fan of some sort prior to his passing. Sad that it takes MJ passing for fans bring his music to a level that he never saw when he was alive. I like most (if you never owned a MJ album) wanted to have at lease one ACTUAL record of MJ's to remember the good music he did. I'll add that listening to \\""You are not alone\\"" is very hard now knowing that MJ is gone. Knowing that he meant so much to so many! It was like his way of leaving a final message! RIP MJ"
956,4,"The second part of Baker's final concert, (two weeks before his death)and although he was well past the exuberance of youth, he was still as expressive as ever. Fine small group, big band and orchestral arrangements add to the pleasure, so, in many ways, a fitting end. If you enjoy this you will definitely want the CD with the first part of the concert.    James Meadows"
957,5,"This and the first zeppelin album is where it all started,every hard rock band since has followed these 2 blueprints.The most influential metal album of all time. The debut of the founding fathers. Sabbath were initially inspired by The Beatles to make music but this album began with a simple idea after Iommi came out the cinema. His idea was if people would pay too see a horror movie maybe they would pay to listen to a horror album. He was right and Metal was born.............."
958,2,"We like Jennifer Hudson's voice.  We liked the first song or two on this CD.  They went mostly downhill from there.  Listening to the song samples, we expected something better.  I guess 30 seconds per song wasn't enough to get an accurate feel for this album.  Hope the future ones are better.  Would not purchase again."
959,5,"A great 70's frentic jazz soundtrack that suited like few ever have successfully coupled racing images and the roar of the engines passing by with music.  Agreeing with the other reviewer that says that the original vynil makes for a better and richer album with more engine and ambient sounds from the movie, having both, I have to admit that the CD is worth the money, if only I wonder why instead of the Hunter soundtrack (a fine one by itself, by the way), why didn't they included ALSO the tracks from the vynil, with the sounds of the Porsches 917 and Ferraris 512 in this product.   The quality of the CD is very good and thankfully, the songs are EXACTLY the ones used in the film, which is key to me, since some soundtracks that use different cuts or even players (see Bullitt for a perfect example of this) in their \\""home edition\\"", makes completely pointless and enraging to buy it.  Some goodies come in form of never before heard songs or parts of them (even in the vynil), such as \\""Loneliness in the wind\\"", a real masterpiece of this soundtrack, in my opinion, and a real treat to have the in-crescendo at the beggining, exploding with the sound of racing cars passing by and then a nostalgic trumpet melody.  But a real miss is the different version of a frentic song from the vynil edition (\\""The Race, Last Laps\\"").  Anyway, \\""The Hunter\\"" soundtrack is left somewhat on the shadow of \\""Le Mans\\"", thanks to the sheer quality of the car movie. Although the Hunter is typical Legrand with most of the tracks, it also is somewhat experimental with some barroque themes used throughout the film. They seem more cohesive with the scenes in the movie the more you see them and in the CD, they are nice to listen by themselves, although they seem a bit out of place in what is mainly, a jazz music album.  Summing up this is clearly my favourite CD from my McQueen's soundtracks collection and will always make for a nice listening on your own or shared."
960,4,"Jett's Creek is one of Hope River's newest Bluegrass groups. This has been a year of few releases and also the releases I have heard have been disappointments. This group has a very sparse clean sound. Their strength is a a great selection of songs from many good writers. \\""Supposed To Be\\"" is written by singer Angie Young. The CD was produced by Angie Young and Adam McIntosh. The sound is very clean with a traditional, pop newgrass sound mixed with some beautiful gospel, bluegrass tunes. It is a very good recording, though it has the feel of a demo, not used to hearing such a sparse recording.<br />  Jett's Creek is Angie Young - (lead vocals) , Adam Mcintosh - (banjo,bass, lead guitar, mandolin,lead and harmony vocals.) Jon McIntosh (guitar and lead and harmony vocals.) Pearl Bradley(guy) mandolin. plus on this disc, guest musicians : Evan Mcgregor(fiddle), Tim Kidd (bass on \\""When God Dips his pen of love in My Heart\\"", \\""Supposed to Be\\"" and  \\""I'll Be Back\\"".)<br />  This group is a family band, each member is married and their family is a big part of their lives. A big strength also of the group is their excellent ability to harmonize with each other. On some of their songs ,you can close your eyes and hear old fashioned harmonies from years ago. I, personally, really appreciate the lead guitar work of Adam McIntosh, almost every song has a very melodic guitar solo in the mix, He reminds me a bit of Ron Block of Union Station. He plays some excellent banjo too. The fiddle of Evan Mcgregor really adds alot to the CD.<br />  My personal favorite is the last song on the disc \\""I'll Be Back\\"" (Ronnie and Buddy Cannon) This was on Melanie Cannon's last CD which I really loved. A slow bluegrass ballad that is charged with emotion. \\""A Song For Life\\"" (Rodney Crowell) is a slow beauty. It has some real nice Mandolin and harmonies. Opener \\""Highway 40 Blues\\"" (Larry Cordle) is a great up beat opener.<br />  Lead singer Angie Young has a real Sweet country, bluegrass voice. Her harmonies are also sweet. These musicians really play as one, like they have played together for a long time. Give them a listen, the official CD release party is at the end of this month in Franklin Ohio.<br /><br />[...]re also sweet.

961,5,"One of her greatest works! I'm only 17 and back in '98 was when I was fully exposed to Madonna. I remember watching MTV (when they actually cared about videos) being so intrigued by this woman dancing inasanely, but so happily! A few weeks ago I purchased the album @ a Borders sale and boy was I happy. Every song including the title track had me shakin in my boots LOL.<br />My 3 fav songs:<br />Swim-Excellent song, IMO a true 90's classic.<br /><br />Nothing Really Matters-So beautiful! The lyrics really speak to the heart.<br /><br />Sky Fits Heaven-Superb! Any open minded person connected to their fsmily & surroundings will love this song!"
962,5,"That is, if you want to get into the music of Les Paul & Mary Ford, then this is the best place to start.  I've owned this for about 5 years now and I've always enjoyed it.  All the songs that established them ('How High The Moon', 'The World Is Waiting For The Sunrise', 'Voyas Con Dios' ,etc) are on the first album on the CD titled 'The Hitmakers'.  Also included are some other famous covers and some amazing Les Paul instrumentals.  Literally, 'The Hitmakers' is almost a greatest hits album, that showcased Les & Mary as being ahead of their time.  The second album on the CD, 'Time To Dream' is somewhat the opposite of 'The Hitmakers', it was releasd about 4-5 years later and is a very subdued, almost introspective production.  Very little in the way of Paul's frenetic fret work and/or multi tracking, his minimalist playing lets Ford's vocals express a vast array of emotions on this album.  In all, the best starting point to enjoy Les & Mary is with this CD!"
963,1,"This album is for you. The whining, wanna be sultry diva is a sure fire hit for anyone twelve and under. Maybe in another day I'll think about a future album from hr, but for now I think I'll let her discover boys and life a bit more."
964,4,"I got hooked on \\""Absolutely Still\\"", which is one of BTE's better recent singles with a broad appeal. I was a little taken aback on first listen, however. Many of the song struck me as overly mainstream, but there's actually quite a good mix here. It's a bit of a new direction, but the same could be said of any of their albums. After a couple listens, I'm really enjoying the songs. I think it's just a matter of what you are expecting to hear - even among the more \\""poppy\\"" songs, there's quite a bit of variety. So far, \\""Fit\\"" works the least well for me, and \\""Wounded\\"" seems a bit trite. Overall, though, it's a fun, upbeat collection of songs - not the heavy emotion of some of their previous works, but a high quality BTE pop-rock album."
965,5,"I've been a fan of Mark Elder since his work with English National Opera.  I find his orchestra music releases to be a mixed bag.  Some I like very much, others I can take or leave, depending.    My top fav of the Sibelius first symphony still has to be the singular release by that old trickster, Leopold Stokowski, leading the studio pickup band, National Philharmonic.  I think it is still available on a Sony two-fer, matched with a hohum-decent second symphony by New York under Thomas Schippers.  For good measure, you also get Zino Francescatti doing the violin concerto with help from Bernstein.      Osmo Vanska has a wonderful first symphony, too, part of his full set of all the symphonies. I even got the super audio complete set with Jarvi in Goteberg Sweden.  That set occasions no complaints; yet I am not nearly as moved by its Sibelius as I know I can be, by those readings which take hold and compel musical memory.  Herbert Blomstedt has a first that stays with me.  I hold his complete set with San Francisco to be a high marker among comparisons with single releases and sets all told.  Finally, though not widely released in USA, I managed to get the Sakari Oramo symphony set with Birmingham on Warner.  Right up there, those players, with Blomstedt and Vanska.  I still like Colin Davis in Boston, and his newish LSO label readings, at least some of whom arrive in high resolution super audio surround sound.  I still have the von Karajan-Berlin singles on EMI and DGG.  (Only the third symphony is missing from von Karajan's recorded legacy.)  I've also started on the new super audio Helsinki set led by Vladimir Ashkenazy.    In this new single release, the Halle Orchestra of Manchester is competing with itself.  A full set was recorded on EMI under their former distinguished music director, Sir John Barbirolli.  His reading of the second symphony with the Royal Philharmonic is my touchstone in that work; yet I find his Halle set a mixed bag.  Barbirolli's slow tempos and rhetorical-dramatic flourish are my sort of Sibelius - but sometimes I need more bite from the Halle of his era than I get.    Now, Elder with Halle joins the top Sibelius music ranks, to my ears.    From the opening clarinet atmosphere of the first symphony, we get a sense of wide open Sibelius space, bardic musings and all.  Beneath, timpani rolls are stretching out a heroic line, horizon.  The orchestra is a marvelous instrument, Sibelius said, but it lacks a pedal point.  Then the top strings hit, followed by the lower strings.  Their sound is muscular, ringing, and has that touch of bite.  A listener suddenly thinks this may be a real deal.  As brass and woodwind choirs join the fray, the music unfolds brilliantly in technicolor, panavision sweep.    Elder has the band departments phrasing just a tad more flexibly than not.  The impetus at the heart of the first movement never goes off course, even while Elder has players bring out passing details and flourishes in a turn of the moment.  Some of those turns communicate a nearly intoxicated sense or smell of harsh, chilly, forested climes.  Sibelius sound waves gather and crash upon the brass cliffs.  Crisp woodwinds fill in the many different colors, high to low, and keen like wind or bird sounds.  This sounds a natural landscape, never lazy-leisurely, and not pastoral in the sense that we can afford to kick back and relax, free from change or danger.    By the end of the first movement, I am thinking this disc is a keeper.  It has that bite, that sense of natural forces gathering in outsized, inhuman scale which is essential to the northern atmospherics which typify Sibelius to my ears.  The closing pages are both a dramatic chapter pause, and an unerringly astute invitation to come indoors for a spell, as we shut the doors against the elements.    The second movement is all warmth, hearth song.  Sad touches, fragile with loss, vulnerable to relentless cold.  Folk play touches.  Hero stories.  Family romance touches.  Here is it, right here - that we have all survived so far.  Here.  Kept in all the winters, waiting for all the Springs.  The harmonic shifts are muscular and pulsing, cold guffs brushing us even in full, bright sunshine.  What heroes and heroines our survival has given us, what tales of mystery and courage.  The closing pages of the second movement go all tender with folk color musical designs, permeated with restrained feeling, Lullaby.    Third movement scherzo is happy, vigorous, an outdoor air adventure.  The folk motions are sleigh ride and troika, nearly as populist as, say, Tchaikovsky in the Seasons piano cycle.  Yet something in the music still has bite and can open, back into recollection, bardic narratives, and warmth.  The slowish middle sections have plenty of human scale, set off by that backdrop of hard, rocky, icy North.  Our hunts are a necessity, and also a traditional game of our prowess, being a folk.    The Finale fourth movement is all natural horizon and outward vision again.  Like the first movement, this last takes its own sweet time to gather in its selective, distinctive, musical materials.  Time to note and observe all the lights and shadows cast.  Time to feel how nature moves, slow or fast.  Vigorously, we can now move, alive in this musical landscape.  Ah, those strings in Halle.  Their heft, their bite, their warm song.  This last movement's closing motives are broad song, and broadly sung.  A folk song of the people and the landscape, not just of any individual or family.  Tune and chorus, round and round.  Tune and chorus, dancing.  Tune and chorus, hymnal.  Returning us at the end to the size and sweep of the musical landscapes with which the symphony began.  Our whole human business seems transcendental, like looking back at the blue-green marble of our earth planet, whole, from space.  Hear those bottom, growling pedal points as Sibelius gathers his considerable strength.  What a great, great, great mystery.  Thatall this, and all of we - are here, just here.  Here.    A reading of the third symphony follows this epic presentation of the first.  It strikes out in full folk colors, all flags gently flying in a lifting, even sometimes vigorous breeze.  While other readings are content to emphasize the classical poise and proportions of the first movement as a new calling card for the composer's emerging style; this first movement doesn't hesitate to recall larger, more Romantic matters.  Some of those melodic lines which stay primly reposed under other conductors with other players, here lift up, bigger, born higher aloft with slightly more reach than we might hear as customary.  Musical colors are more saturated, more lights, more shadows.  This first movement will burst confidently into full-throated, vigorous, alive dance and song than is our typical interpretive case.    A second movement gently chimes.  Not only the leading melody, but its harmonies, glow and gleam and glitter, embroidered into the most gorgeous fine musical tapestry.  Again, our central melody matches a deft sense of balance with being remarkably open-hearted.  Quasi Allegretto, those growly bottom orchestra mysteries play transformatively into the upper orchestra harmonics and dancing counterpoint.  Then an effortlessly floating, singing reprise, then done.    The last movement of this third stays true to the folks colors and muscular vitalities that have gone before.  Like other Sibelius final movements, it gathers its materials.  Builds up.  Gestures hints towards the big, hammer-god-slinging-axe main theme that will eventually break through in the fifth symphony's last movement.  Again the string counterpoint has bite, as well as point.  Old George Szell in Cleveland was a past master of this sort of magic.  By the end of this movement, our journey is complete, and the closing has been more big hearted than usual.  Yes, yes, yes.                The notes for this disc say that the first symphony wasrecorded in the studio, and the third symphony, live.  You cannot distinguish per any negatives in the sound.  Nor is the studio first one whit less exciting, colorful, or engaged than the live concert performance of the third.  No intrusive audience noises, save for the closing applause.  If this is the start of a full Sibelius symphony cycle, we are in for a rare and delicious musical treat.  More than most readings committed to disc already, this first disc lays out a case for Sibelius that is so far from ordinary - even the most excellent sort of ordinary - that I can resolutely call for cheers.  Lovers of Sibelius, unite, rejoice.  This disc is the real Sibelius deal.  Oh yes, five stars."
966,3,"Most or all of her songs on this album and the last one are cover songs.  Cascada needs more original songs.  I don't know if her voice is as nice as it sounds on the CD since everything is wholly produced.  Cascada tends to fit the mainstream beauty queen of overly used produced techno pop music that is great sounding, but very unoriginal to the point of superficialness.  Most of the remakes do not stand out besides What Hurts the Most, which provides a good beat and melody for a different version to a great song.  There is a lot of becoming promise for Cascada if the record companies let her, but it is probably more about the $$$$."
967,4,"If you like good solid rock and a touch of melody mixed with a God centered message, this is a great cd. I have a hard time getting into christian rock, it just doesnt move me musicaly. Fireflight have a great sound and the cd is well produced."
968,5,"Wintley Phipps has a God-given gift in his ability to sing. If you love gospel music, this man is the one to listen to. When I listen to this man sing I get goose bumps every time!"
969,5,This CD is a remastering of a beautiful cassette called INSTRUMENTS OF PEACE.  Singh Kaur has one of the most beautiful voices that I have ever heard.  The timelessness of INSTRUMENTS OF PEACE lives on in IMAGINE PEACE.
970,5,Product arrived before expected date in great condition. Will purchase from user in the future.
971,4,"I bought his \\""Closer\\"" album at Wal-mart about 4 months ago and loved it. I heard it so many times I wanted to hear some of his other ones so I purchased \\""Awake\\"" and this album. I was very disappointed with Awake and only cared for 4 of the songs. On the other hand, I have been enjoying most of his songs on this \\""Josh Groban\\"" album. His soothing voice always makes me relax. Highly recommended if you like this style of singing / music."
972,5,I love this CD!  I bought this not knowing what the lengths of the songs were so I thought I would share that with everyone.<br /><br />01.  It Only Takes A Minute (4:00)<br />02.  Heaven Must Be Missing An Angel (6:55)(1985 Irresistible Angel Mix)<br />03.  Slow Train To Paradise (4:59)<br />04.  Never Had A Love Like This Before (4:34)<br />05.  Check It Out (3:20)<br />06.

973,5,Fantastic from start to finish. Rocks your soul so play it LOUD! The best voice singing the best lyrics and the best band. Built to last for decades. What real music sounds like. Listen to it. You'll love it. Full of heart and soul. You'll compare all other music to this masterpiece from now on. Just Listen! You'll see what I mean.
974,1,"This album just drips with pretentiousness, but doesn't have the substance to back it up.  Don't be fooled, this album will not become Margot's Pinkerton, it's just plain booooooring."
975,5,[[ASIN:B000001FS3 The Joshua Tree]]  I received this CD quickly and it was in excellent condition.  I would definitely order from this seller again and recommend him to other shoppers.
976,5,"Whether you are a fan of Sesame Street or just wanna teach your kids the<br />A-B-C's and 1,2,3's...Songs From The Street: 35 Years of Music is a fantastic CD.<br />Songs like \\""The Pin Ball Number Count\\"", which teaches how to count to twelve while using a fast upbeat rhythm, and \\""Ladybug's Picnic\\"" which also teaches to count to twelve using a fast upbeat rhythm.<br />Then there are songs that teach about numbers like \\""I've Got Five People In My Family\\"", which teaches about the number five and teaches about family members, and \\""I'v Got Two\\"" which teaches about the number two and about body parts (two eyes, two ears, two arms, etc.)<br />My Favorite songs are the nonsense songs like \\""Rubber Duckie\\"" and \\""What's The Name Of That Song\\"" which taught me to LOVE music.<br /><br />This CD is educational and fun to listen to. Parents can reminscence about the songs they grew up with and teach their kids their A-B-C's and 1,2,3's and teach other things like \\""Everybody Sleeps\\""."
977,3,"It would be easy to lump the Cardigans into the mid-90s one-hit wonder category, and perhaps this is justifiable from a certain perspective.  Their signature song \\""Lovefool\\"" was distinctive and catchy, and with contemporaries like Smashmouth, Sugar Ray, and Fastball, whose full albums were radically different from their singles, the music consumer should have been wary.  However, I don't think that \\""Lovefool\\"" is necessarily the best song on \\""First Band on the Moon.\\""  I think that it stands out because, as a single, it received a great deal of production attention.  However, it is not in a radically different style than the rest of the album, and I think that several other songs are just as hooky and clever.  Suspending the bloated expectations presented by \\""Lovefool\\"" reveals a pretty solid and enjoyable album.<br /><br />The Cardigans' sound is pastiched and nostalgic, but at least the styles that they reference are clear.  Overall, there is a strong 70s disco aesthetic, complete with strings, to the proceedings, but with a healthy dose of tounge-in-cheek lounge (i.e. the silly \\""Iron Man\\"" cover).  While the presence of a vibraphone probably appealed to my 90's Twin Peaks fanboy side, infectious songs propel \\""First Band on the Moon\\"" more readily than the specific instruments used.  As an example, check out \\""Been It,\\"" which offers chunky riffs and quiet staccato guitar chords, in contrast to \\""Great Divide,\\"" as it dreamily shimmers with mallets and fender-rhodes.  If I were to point to a weak tune, it would probably be \\""Loser,\\"" which comes off as two songs that did not quite mesh convincingly into one.<br /><br />THE LOWDOWN:  Even today, people may ask if they \\""had any other songs.\\""  The answer is yes.  Purchasing \\""First Band on the Moon\\"" is not buying a \\""Lovefool\\"" single with a bunch of B-sides.  Instead, it is an album that stands on its own as a consistent and unique example of melodic mid-90s power pop."
978,5,"I bought this cd after not listening to it for many years.  It is just as good now as when it was released 30 some years ago.. Ageless, classic sentiments that are as fresh now as they were in 1975.  Beautiful, heartfelt lyrics.  I saw Springsteen when I was 16 right before he went big. This cd brought back that experience full force."
979,5,"I just got this album yesterday, and it is awesome. There is not one track that doesn't stand out. It runs the gammet from hard rock to country all without losing that signature Ian Thornley style. If you've dug everything so far, this will not disappoint."
980,4,"Not as good as the followup CD, Reach, but still a great title from Warren Barfield.  Any fan of his later work should appreciate this collection as well.  \\""Beautiful Broken World\\"" and \\""10 Hours\\"" are both amazing songs, probably the 2 standouts on the album.  If for no other reason, this CD is worthy for those 2 tracks.  If you're not sure about this CD, pick up a copy of Barfield's \\""Reach\\"" instead."
981,5,"While not a complete collection of Scott Joplin's work, this beautiful set contains 30 piano masterpieces by the King of Ragtime. Many pianists play Joplin too slow. Others too fast. But in this collection, the music is played at a perfect pace. In addition to the CD's, the set comes with six pieces af excellent artwork by Hambone ([...]) I definately recommend this to any fans of Joplin, ragtime or music in general."
982,5,"For those of you who have never heard local Chicago artists Bill Buczinsky, here is your chance. Bill has been performing his original poetry for kids and adults for over 12 years.    If you're one of those that starts to yawn at the mention of 'poetry' then you'll be surprised at this CD. There's poetic stories, sound effects, and music. My two daughters love this CD, especially The Dawg Doctor and Dr. Seuss. Parents will love A Grandmother's Blessing and Uncle Shel - a touching tribute to Shel Silverstein.    Bill also has a writing journal called [[ASIN:0979828309 Strange World: A Poetic Journey]] that goes along perfectly with the CD.    If you can't see Bill perform in person, this CD is the next best thing."
983,5,"If you only read Cline's liner notes for this CD, which are full of philosophically tortuous phrases like \\""the designation I call 'I'\\"", you might expect a lot of New Age noodling in the music. And certainly the music is profoundly meditative, but the key qualifier here is that word \\""profound.\\"" Cline and his bandmates manage an almost impossible combination of peace and intensity. Every note is exactly the right note, the only note for that moment, and no matter how slow or spacious the setting, the feeling is never languorous. You get the sense that each musician is intensely present, floating in a rushing stream in that actively passive way that Buddhism aspires to. Peggy Lee's cello playing, especially, is wonderfully expressive and passionate (she's always interesting in her recordings, but never more beautiful than on this CD). Cline plays an enormous kit on this session, but you would never know it--his uses it for color and places himself in a supporting role, adding exactly the right notes in exactly the right places. His solo introduction to \\""On the Bones of the Homegoing Thunder\\"" is a masterpiece of texture, dynamics, and expression,  and gives a sense of the enormous technique he could bring to bear if he chose. But like everyone else on this recording, he serves the music and uses only the necessary notes. Many years ago, in one of Robert Fripp's wonderful columns for Musician magazine he wrote, \\""Music is the cup that holds the wine of silence.\\"" That sublime idea has never been more perfectly manifested than here."
984,5,"Even though I had all of Brandy's CD's, I couldn't help but buy this wonderful collection! While she had only four albums (at the time), and each of them were four years apart (except for \\""Full Moon\\"" and \\""Afrodisiac\\"" which were only two), she made sure each album was top notch... something you wouldn't get tired of. This collection includes four songs from her debut self-titled release, six from \\""Never Say Never\\"", two from \\""Full Moon\\"", two from \\""Afrodisiac\\"", three songs from various albums or soundtracks, and a bonus remix, totaling 18 tracks. While this seems like a lot, you won't wanna skip any of them!    It starts off with \\""Baby\\"", which was her second single and #1. It is a catchy little song by a (then) fourteen year old. It is followed by \\""Best Friend\\"", then \\""I Wanna Be Down\\"". (The latter was her debut). Next is \\""Brokenhearted\\"", which is actually a remix of the album version, this time a deut with Wanya Morris from Boyz II Men. (The version used in the video) While the album version is nice, I actually prefer this version!    Now we move forward to 1998, when Brandy's second (and most successful so far) album, \\""Never Say Never\\"" came out. First off, we are treated to \\""Angel in Disguise\\"", which even though it was never officially a single, it charted on the Billboard Hot 100 and is a fan favorite. So, it rightfully takes its place on the disc. Brandy's biggest hit ever was no doubt \\""The Boy Is Mine\\"", a duet with Monica. You've probably heard this song before. Like the title says, it's just the two young women fighting over a man. \\""Almost Doesn't Count\\"" is another favorite of mine, and it did fairly well as a single. It's followed by \\""Top of the World\\"", which features Ma$e rapping. This track has a nice beat, but it's not as good as some of the others. Next comes a new favorite of mine! I'd never heard this remix of \\""U Don't Know Me (Like U Used To)\\"", but I'm glad I finally did. The original was GREAT, but this one is just plain SICK! The beat is better, the rapping is great, and the re-sung verses are better than ever! After that, Brandy's second biggest hit, \\""Have You Ever?\\"" plays.    Four years, a marriage, a baby, AND a divorce latter, we get only two songs from 2002's \\""FULL MOON\\"". This was my favorite album, so I was a little disappointed that there were only two songs, but they are two of the best. This part starts with the title track. This track is a hot track that will have you dancing. I could also say this about the next track, \\""What About Us?\\"".    Two more years later, we get \\""Afrodisiac\\"". This album was a little more personal than the three before it. It was loved by fans and praised by critics, but somehow it flopped. My theory? The single choices. \\""I Tried\\"" and \\""Afrodisiac\\"" were both rumored to become singles, but unfortunately neither was ever released (although the latter was released as a single overseas.) Also \\""Turn It Up\\"" was released as a promo, but it never became an official single. Instead we got \\""Who Is She 2 U\\"" and \\""Talk About Our Love\\"" (both of which are on this collection). While \\""Who Is She 2 U\\"" is a good, catchy song, it's nothing in comparison to the other songs from \\""Afro\\"". \\""Talk About Our Love\\"" features Kanye West, and is alright, but not that good.    The last few tracks include \\""Sittin' Up In My Room\\"" from the \\""Waiting to Exhale\\"" soundtrack, \\""Rock wit U\\"" by Quincy Jones feat. Brandy & Heavy D, \\""Another Day in Paradise\\"" with her brother Ray J, which was a single overseas, and the rap remix of \\""I Wanna Be Down\\"" which features Brandy singing the intro and chorus, and MC Lyte, Yo-Yo, and Queen Latifiah rapping new verses.    Overall, this is a wonderful CD that takes you through all the years of Brandy's career. If we're lucky, Brandy will keep releasing hits like in the past and stick around for a LONG time."

986,1,"Half of the content of this album has been originated by Sarah Brightman.  Katherine Jenkins simply transposed the songs to lower keys to suit her 3rd rate mezzo sopran.  Apart from her nice \\""behind\\"" on the cover Katherine Jenkins has nothing to offer but remakes from Sarah Brightman's repertoire.  Stay away from this copy cat and buy the original."
987,5,"Oh yeah!! I'm so glad I got this, we can't help but sing and dance along with our little girl who knows all the words to all the songs, i would buy this cd all over again...."
988,5,This CD is very enjoyable. The music is familiar and easy to sing along with.
989,3,I have been a fan since her first album. This album lacks the emotion of her earlier work. For die hard fans only.
990,5,I have wanted to get this CD for years. I have been playing it all x-mas season!
991,4,"Not his best album, but well above average for today's country music.  A great songwriter on a very good album."
992,4,"This is a really good CD! It took me a long time to finally buy it. My favorite songs are How Can I Live, When Darkness Falls, and Army of Me. The other songs are pretty good too. If you love rock, heavy metal, and Freddy Vs. Jason, you'll love FREDDY VS. JASON SOUNDTRACK!!!"
993,4,"This album is a brilliant piece of history. Bob Dylan sings his heart out and interacts with the crowd in a way you would have to hear to understand. He does seem a little stoned or drunk, i'll admit but as far as quality goes, the sound is great considering the time frame it was captured in. The unexpected guest appearance on tracks 4-7 on the 2nd disc compliment Mr. Dylan's Vocals and melodiously capture the heart of the listener with the raw emotion found in 60's folk music. Overall, This album is a must-have if you enjoy Bob Dylan."
994,3,"My introduction to the music of Dungen came several years ago when I spotted this on the shelf for a good price at a favorite Encinitas music store. I had read a number of enthusiastic reviews of Dungen and this album in particular and am into several other Swedish prog groups, so I didn't hesitate to snap it up.  Well, when I played it for the first time, I was rather disappointed. Let's be realistic, as adept as Dungen is musically his vocals are often discordant and sometimes even obnoxious. So whatever I like about the album is all about the music. Ta Det Lungt straddles a troika of styles: Prog, alt-rock, and psychedelic. The eclectic mix of songs often evokes the quirky style of Pavement.  On disc one, my favorite cuts are the psychedelic Bortglomd and Sluta Folja Efter, which is one of the cuts evocative of Pavement. The most execrable song is the god-awful Du Ar For Fin For Mig (sorry about no umlauts). If you are into prog, you will probably most enjoy Panda, Det Du Tanker Idag Ar Du I Morgon, Lejonet & Kulan, the aforementioned Bortglomd and Om Du Vore En Vakthund. Those who lean toward the style of Pavement should like Gjort Bort Sig, Festival, the title cut, Lipsill and the previously mentioned Sluta Folja Efter.  On the bonus disc, the only real stinker is the first cut, Tyst Minut. The next three are pretty decent especially Sjutton and the harder-edged Christopher. The final cut, Badsang, is just plain weird.  Overall, I am not too excited about Ta Det Lungt. I will listen to it occasionally, But I don't foresee it ever achieving heavy rotation in my home. If you don't know Dungen, he's at least worth a listen. Try to hear a few complete songs, then decide for yourself whether or not he merits any further scrutiny."
995,4,"Britney Spears' CIRCUS comes a year after what I thought was one of her best CDs, [[ASIN:B000WQ9UA8 Blackout]].  The first song, \\""Womanizer,\\"" on CIRCUS is reminiscent of the high-energy vibe that BLACKOUT offered, but the rest of the CD unfortunately doesn't follow-through. The songs are listenable, but just don't feel catchy enough like her past hits.  None of them really stand out, other than \\""Womanizer\\"" and possibly the second song, \\""Circus.\\""  I miss the frivolity of \\""Oops...I Did It Again,\\"" the self-confidence and resilience of \\""Stronger,\\"" the sexiness of \\""I'm A Slave 4 U\\"" and \\""Breathe On Me,\\"" and the sweetness of \\""Everytime.\\""  The songs are slowly catching on with me, but they're taking longer than with BLACKOUT and other past Britney CDs.<br /><br />Note to Britney's song writers: let's leave out reference to Britney's sordid past.  We all know about it, but it's time to move forward.  Lyrics like \\""You say I'm crazy? I got your crazy\\"" in \\""Womanizer\\"" and the entire song of \\""Blur\\"" about excessive drinking and blacking out don't help to promote a better image of her.  There's a time and place for that.  And this is neither the time nor the place.  And what's up with \\""Mmmm Papi?\\""  Last time I checked, Britney wasn't Hispanic."
996,5,"When I was growing up in Northern Michigan we had a magnificent choir at our church. My father had a wonderful baritone voice, Mrs. Dix played the huge pipe organ, her husband could have been a concert violinist. Frank Toriano had a tenor voice that certainly could have made him a part of the New York Met, had he so chosen. All of this to tell you readers of this review that many of these songs on this CD were sung regularly in our church. These priests do such a beautiful rendition of each of them that I could not help but think that the Dixes, Frank, the other members of the choir and my dad were singing along with me as I sung along with \\""The Priests\\"". In these so troubled days throughout the world and in our own country, it is so great to witness pure, beautiful, God given talent, used for His greater glory and honor. David A. Sullivan"
997,5,"This is a very nice two-disc set, and to my ears the songs sound as great as they ever did, if not better.      In \\""Movement\\"" New Order channels the spirit of the Joy Division days at times, but this music represents a transition into new things.  While the listener can almost hear the late Ian Curtis in places in \\""Movement\\"", the extra tracks on the second disc, when taken as a whole, are something of a musical departure from the Joy Division sound.  At this point the band was moving from the darkness of Joy Division into a more exuberant, beat-oriented sound, still embracing some of their recent past but also showing movement toward a new day.      This represents primitive, emotive, ambient dance music at its finest.  What may sound minimalist at first listen becomes the kind of dense, layered, deep stuff that I can't resist moving to.  \\""Movement\\"", indeed! This music makes me want to get up and move as much as it did over 25 years ago.      If you haven't listened to New Order for quite a while, as I hadn't, this is a wonderful way to get back into their sound.  Joy Division was a fine band, but so is New Order, as \\""Movement\\"" clearly demonstrates.      Here's to the Factory label, and here's to Warner/Rhino for giving us all such a great treat!"
998,4,"The third installment in Naxos series of Sibelius' piano music under Håvard Gimse focuses on works from the middle of his artistic career. Sibelius is usually not considered a great piano composer, and anyone seeking piano equivalents of his orchestral works here will be disappointed - in fact, there are only a handful of moments and passages from which anyone coming new to these pieces would be able to guess the composer. Certainly not in the 10 pieces op. 58 or the rondinos op. 68, perhaps at certain points in the sonatinas op. 67.    Even so, these are not mere salon trinkets, but interesting, colorful impressionistic pieces that does not seem to be stylistically very close to anyone (which is indeed interesting insofar as they don't resemble Sibelius the orchestral composer either). Some touches of Debussy, perhaps? Some passages resembling Scriabin, maybe - a little (but not very much) Grieg. Liszt and Schumann are certainly influences ...    None of these works are masterpieces, but they are certainly interesting and more so than Sibelius the piano composer has often been given credit for. Gimse plays them as if they were masterpieces - sometimes he might even over-interpret them a little - and the sound is a tad unnatural. All in all, recommended for those who wants some imaginative and interesting piano music and who do not expect the Sibelius of the orchestral works."
999,5,"Oooooh Boy! I actually use to listen to The Style Council back in the 80's and I \\""by accident\\"" picked this up in 1997 when I was out in Denver on a business contract trip for 4 months.  I have to say I liked this album at first but then I put it on the shelf for many years.  I then picked this 2001 version up again and listened to it again in 2008 AND THIS ONE IS WAY BETTER!!!...flows better and sounds better remastered! It includes ALL of the major cutz that The Jam are known for.  Sooooo, if you want to start off with a first album from The Jam then get THIS ONE FIRST!  This CD KICKS AZZ!!!!!  Going Underground..."
1000,5,"The most important factor in a song to me is its ability to make me feel something.  After that, I want a catchy tune, intriguing lyrics, and pleasing vocals.  A good album is one which has at least five songs that meets that criteria.<br /><br />I have been listening to Sonya Kitchell's THIS STORM CD for more than a month now.  I haven't tired of it yet, and I don't foresee this happening in the near future.  Ms. Kitchell more than meets my desires regarding great songs and a good album - every song on THIS STORM is a hit in my book.<br /><br />Are they top 40 material?  Maybe not, at least not each one.  However, customers who purchase this album will not be disappointed, assuming they enjoy bluesy, poignant pop music.<br /><br />Sonya Kitchell has a unique sound, a charismatic voice, and the instrumentation complements her vocals without competing with her.  The background vocals are subtle, providing a perfect enhancement to Kitchell's splendid voice.<br /><br />If I had to pick a favorite song from this CD, it would likely be FOR EVERY DROP, although EFFORTLESS might just tie for that top position as my favorite.<br /><br />I will definitely be purchasing more of Sonya Kitchell's work, based on how much I have enjoyed THIS STORM.<br /><br />Tracklist:<br /><br />  1. For Every Drop<br />  2. Borderline<br />  3. Running<br />  4. Here To There<br />  5. Walk Away<br />  6. Fire<br />  7. Soldier's Lament<br />  8. Robin In The Snow<br />  9.

1001,5,"Andy Bey is one of those talents whose story is a more a crime not tragedy (and jazz hsitory is replete with both).His is a survivor in many a sense  and beyond all his courage a man of extraordinary range,talent,and feeling.Andy Bey is a singer who was born in 1939.In late 50's he had a band with his two sisters and they recorded and LP.Did do much here in states but they had some popularity in Europe.By the earl 70's when many male (and female) jazz singers gave up he tried to stay in he came and recoded with the likes of Gary Bartz and others.But he was truly an insiders talent and didn't have much opportunity.He tries not to bitter but has every right to be as far as the industry was concerned.    Yet he got a second chance with this 1996 release.I found it the first year I stared running a jazz section at a Hifi shop.I was just blown away from the first song.I am so glad he got this chance when a producer saw him in a club and wondered why he wasn't being recoded.This mark his first recording in 22 years.And it is a sparse gem of just his piano and voice.It is so stripped down and personal I find it another aspect of his courage to expose himself emotionally.I know I use the words \\""Feeling\\"" and \\""Pathos\\"" a lot i my reviews but this album would be a great entry into a dictionary for those very words.The tunes he plays:1. Someone to Watch over Me-Gershwin, George    2. You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To - Porter, Cole    3. I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart - Ellington, Duke    4. In a Sentimental Mood -Ellington, Duke    5. Willow Weep for Me - Ronell, Ann    6. Yesterdays - Harbach, Otto    7. If You Could See Me Now - Dameron, Tadd    8. I'm Just a Lucky So and So -David, Mack    9. Day Dream - Ellington, Duke    10. Embraceable You - Gershwin, George    They are all delivered with a rough hewn baritone though Bey posses a 4 octave range.Now I know that nobody wants to be stereotyped or sentimentalized so his discovery 2 years before this CD shouldn't give it import \\""of tragedy\\"" that so many gave to Billie Holiday who prefer her latter period because they \\""here her pain\\"".Andy might have have reason to be pissed off about the industry (and said so referring to Diana Krall In a NY Times interview saying her reception would be different if she were black.I couldn't agree more thinking she's cheesecake and coquetteish more than a equal talent to those she outsells).But one has to admire the difficulty of being a gay black man in the \\""macho\\"" world of jazz (to explore that read David Hadju's book \\""Lush Life,about Billy Strayhorn superb jazz book and one of history and prose in itself).And I wish that everybody who has bigotry towards gays could here him and listen that when Bey sings \\""She\\"" you could substitute \\""He\\"" for him or any person.Love is love.It certantly is more real and worthy of recognition and acceptance than having a few ridiculous stereotype characters on television.But again if you didn't know any of this you could listen and just be in awe of his originality combined with a respect for the traditional song and just think him a great talent.I think that for me Bey is the equal of any singer of the past and I put hi among Johnny Hartman (who's good looks and talent should have made his star but his overt sensuality and racism limited him in way's a safe performer like Nat Cole was not limited).Bey had a wonderful follow up Shades Of Bey where he does a beautiful now foten cover of a Nick Drake English modern Folk tune \\""Riverman\\"".And two more CD's after that. 70 I know he was still gigging last year.And I hope there are many more years.Check the You Tube Andy Bey Television Interview done with Billy Taylor.It's great.I have all his work and think of the gift we got ad try not to concentrate on the forces that kept him form greater success.Because in my mind there is nobody more successful in conveying the emotion of the Great American Songbook than Andy Bey and for that we should be thankful.  Thank you Andy  Chazz"

1005,1,"This is a highly disappointing release and for these very reasons:<br /><br />(a.)  What's HERE is mostly obscure early 80's R&B from a label that failed to promote it's R&B acts.<br /><br />(b.)  What's MISSING is the &#34;Disco&#34; which this collection boasts that it contains.<br /><br />For a label that was hardly known for its roster of Disco acts, I find it comical that the acts listed here are not even representative of that genre of music.  I used to own all of the Capitol &#34;Disco&#34; records which beared the &#34;Capitol Disco&#34; stamp on the record labels themselves and whomever compiled this awful collection obviously does not know which records were &#34;Disco&#34; and which were NOT from the Capitol label.  I'll begin with what WAS &#34;Disco&#34; and what songs are missing here so as to prevent others from buying this severely pointless and laughable compilation:<br /><br />&#34;Master of Love,&#34; &#34;Love Magnet,&#34; &#34;Happy Days Are Here Again/Happy Music (Dance the Night Away,)&#34; &#34;I'll Do Anything for You&#34; and &#34;Red Hot&#34; by Freda Payne; &#34;Haven't Stopped Dancin' Yet,&#34; &#34;Just Let It Lay,&#34; &#34;Love It (You're the One,&#34;) &#34;No Way to Treat A Lady&#34; and &#34;People's Party&#34; by Gonzalez, the latter three which were produced by Pete Bellotte (of Donna Summer fame.)<br /><br />And where is &#34;Disco Fairlyand&#34; by Kitty and The Haywoods or Shobizz' &#34;Do It in the Dark?&#34;  Where is Helen Reddy's ONLY BOW to Disco, &#34;Make Love to Me,&#34; a remake of Kelly Marie's song in all of it's seven minutes of Disco glory?  How about &#34;Never Gonna Change My Mind&#34; by Plaza, anything hitworthy (at that time) from &#34;Dance Forever&#34; by Cheryl Ladd (of Charlie's Angels fame), &#34;We All Need Love&#34; by Troiano, &#34;Our Love Is Insane&#34; by Desmond Child And Rouge or &#34;Shake Your Body (It's the Joint)&#34; by Gary Bartz (which is more of a Funk joint than it is a Disco joint, but it still qualifies as Disco having been released in 1977 as a 12&#34; single)?  Tavares isn't even shown here with ANY of their Disco hits which include &#34;The Ghost of Love,&#34; &#34;Heaven Must Be Missing An Angel,&#34; &#34;More Than A Woman,&#34; &#34;Straight from Your Heart&#34; and/or &#34;Don't Take Away the Music.&#34;  These were all released prior to 1980 and one or two were featured on the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack, a milestone recording which epitomized the Disco sound.  Where are &#34;Shoot Your Best Shot&#34; and &#34;Red Light,&#34; two Disco smash hits from Linda Clifford's first Capitol/RSO/Curtom album, &#34;I'm Yours&#34; from 1980?<br /><br />Also strange is that Capitol's ONLY platinum Disco single, &#34;Boogie Oogie Oogie,&#34; from A Taste of Honey is passed up for &#34;Do It Good,&#34; their 1979 single which introduced their &#34;Another Taste&#34; album and which didn't even chart Disco.  It charted R&B instead and peaked at U.S. #13.  Go figure.<br /><br />Soul siren, Natalie Cole, like Reddy, attempted ONLY ONE bow to Disco with her &#34;I Love You So&#34; album in 1979.  If anything, its title cut or an extended version of its only hit single, &#34;Stand By&#34; might have made more sense than &#34;Annie Mae&#34; which was the 2nd single from two albums prior (&#34;Thankful,&#34; 1977) and which was straight-up R&B.  &#34;Sophisticated Lady&#34; which is showcased here is a Funk/Rock song and it was taken from THREE albums prior (&#34;Natalie,&#34; 1976.)  Minnie Riperton (in all of her late greatness) is severely misrepresented here with &#34;Adventures in Paradise,&#34; a Funk-Rock tune and &#34;Baby This Love I Have,&#34; an R&B ballad.  Where are HER two bows to Disco with &#34;Young, Willing & Able&#34; and/or &#34;Stick Together,&#34; which were released as 12&#34; singles from her magnificent &#34;Stay in Love (A Romantic Fantasy Set to Music&#34;) album from 1977?<br /><br />Gloria Jones is represented here with &#34;Windstorm,&#34; which IS accurate, however she had two other Disco nuggets entitled &#34;Bring Back the Love (Why Can't We Be Friends&#34;) and &#34;When I Was A Little Girl,&#34; which isn't shown here at all and  was similar to anything Gloria Gaynor or Thelma Houston might have recorded/released and must certainly be in the Capitol vaults.  I owned IT TOO on a 12&#34; Disco single.<br /><br />Also missing in action are Nancy Wilson's &#34;I'm Gonna Let Ya&#34; from her &#34;Music on My Mind&#34; album from 1978, &#34;Love, Life and Harmony&#34; and &#34;Take My Love&#34; from her 1979 & 1980 albums of the same names.  Even though Wilson attempted Disco and failed, these selections are certainly qualifiable enough to have been included here.<br /><br />On another note, I wouldn't tell Frankie Beverly that he's a Disco artist by what is indicated here.  &#34;Southern Girl&#34; is ANYTHING but a Disco song; it's a gritty and soulful Funk/Rock nugget.<br /><br />It's not to say that the songs here are bad; it's just that most of them are simply NOT Disco songs.  Diana Ross was NOT a Capitol artist, so it's beyond me how her abysmal workout song, &#34;Work That Body&#34; ended up here.  She recorded this song on RCA in 1981.<br /><br />&#34;Mystic Merlin's &#34;Sixty Thrills A Minute&#34; as well as Donna Washington's &#34;'Scuse Me, While I Fall in Love&#34; and Ashford & Simpson's &#34;Street Corner&#34; were released respectively in 1981 and 1982.  Disco ended in 1980, so I don't understand quite how the &#34;Disco&#34; format plays into ANY of these three selections either.  Finally, and more perplexing is T-Connection's &#34;Party Night.&#34;  This was (a flop) released in 1983 which is three years after the Disco Movement had completely waned.<br /><br />For this collection and its asking price, I would save your money, pray for the day it's re-issued (and CORRECTLY with the RIGHT SONGS and not with all the filler) or just buy it more cheaply new or used if only for some of the obscure cuts that are not available (yet) on CD.<br /><br />This is ANYTHING but a Disco album.  Don't be fooled by the title and/or the &#34;Disco&#34;-ish photos on the front of the package.  It's completely misleading.  What titles I mention at the top of this review are the titles that Capitol is holding hostage in its vaults and that SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED here as opposed to the songs that ARE.  Had this set contained any of THESE, it would have been an incredible package to own and one that I'm SURE today would be in great demand by fans of the the label's Disco output.  Many of these songs are still available on vinyl and most likely will continue to be until Capitol gets with it.  I'm sure that some may be available for download at a fairly reasonable price too.<br /><br />Like the very fitting title of a single taken from Gonzalez' swansong Capitol album, &#34;Watch Your Step,&#34; suggests and which is ALSO MISSING from this collection, &#34;Disco Can't Go On Forever,&#34; HERE the Disco never got started to begin with on this poorly compiled, sadly misrepresented and laughable set, so save your money, research the REAL Capitol Disco records and download.  None of the label's &#34;Disco&#34; catalog items except for a few that aren't even here made an impact at radio or in sales ANYWAY save for Tavares, A Taste of Honey and Gonzalez and to do so would probably not cost very much.<br /><br />Again, this is NOT a Capitol Disco album.  The Capitol Disco is completely MISSING and this is a sad realization for the fans (like myself) whom have been waiting with baited breath for YEARS to hear those songs in crisp, remastered form.  This collection might have been retitled instead, &#34;Capitol Doesn't Know What It's Doing As Usual.&#34;ndstorm,&#34; which IS accurate, however she had two other Disco nuggets entitled &#34;Bring Back the Love (Why Can't We Be Friends&#34;) and &#34;When I Was A Little Girl,&#34; which isn't shown here at all and  was similar to anything Gloria Gaynor or Thelma Houston might have recorded/released and must certainly be in the Capitol vaults.

1006,1,"I have loved Keane since I bought their fist album. I thought their second album was pretty good. But this album is bad. A few of the songs are okay, although not very exciting, like 'black burning heart', and 'better than this'. I hate how 80's they went with their sound. If I wanted to know how Keane would have sounded in the 80's I would listen to U2. I hate U2. I like 80's music, just not crappy 80's music. And the song 'Playing Along' sounds like Radiohead, which I usually think is a good thing. But this song would be better if actually done by Radiohead. It would have had better lyrics, at least. The lyrics on the whole album are corny, especially the ones about monkeys. I am so disappointed. Keane used to be my favorite band, but I wish I had never heard this album."
1007,5,"This album for me it's very motivational to just put on and get going with something.  One could of course get nitpicky and possibly lower it down to 4 stars but when I compare it with the garbage out there in the glam-rap world it leaves it in the dust.  Dust seriously tore up the beats (try it at least once on headphones) and Manchild put his soul into it as usual, to be expected with these very talented artists but if you are new to Mars ILL, however, I'd recommend you get Raw Material before this one.  Oh yeah, and, \\""Music bout nothin but cash is garbage\\"" ... my sentiments!"
1008,5,I think this is one of her best albums.  Love that voice of hers.
1009,2,"When I first heard the single ER on the radio, I was hyped. I could not wait for the album to drop. But after listening to the CD for the first time, I must admit that I was a little disappointed. Except for ER, nothing else really jumped out at me off the bat. Then I listened to it a few more times and I have to say, it's really growing on me. A little different sound, but still that distinctive voice. The snippets from the forthcoming CD sounds really good. I'm axiously waiting for it to drop in Feb.2009."
1010,1,"I would like to be able to review Clutch \\""Impetus\\"" but can't. The disc I received was stamped as Clutch and had the \\""Impetus\\"" inserts but was in fact a dreadful disc by Napalm Death. Obviously a screwup at the Earache Records pressing plant. I received a replacement disc from Amazon and it had the same problem. After a flurry of emails I finally received a credit for returning both discs. Amazon told me they were going to pull them all but I don't think they did. Buyer beware."
1011,4,"Hugh Burns does some killer guitar soloing on the DiMeola-esque \\""Kill King Rat\\"" which starts off the cd.  He has another midway through the cd on \\""March Past...\\""  And the last 40 seconds of the cd fade out with a nice acoustic guitar outro from him.  Other than that, there's nary a trace of this bear?<br /><br />This is mostly a drums and saxophone album, which is great if that's what you're into;  and Terry Bozzio and Tony Coe can certainly carry the load.  Tony Hymas' keyboards are pretty noticeable too, though they serve more in the background and for \\""atmosphere\\"" than with true soloing, which is fine too.  I just don't get why they make such sparing use of Burns' guitar skills here.  If nothing else, let him play the bass, because those duties are carried out by Hymas on the keyboards.  Doesn't sound bad, but I LOVE bass guitar, and this music is just SCREAMING for some low-end fretless bass; let's perpetuate the image of a big fat growling bear here!<br /><br />The music itself is unique.  There are a lot of rhythmically-derived songs that have a \\""world jazz\\"" feel to them  -  sort of an Andalusian or South American feel.  I like this music, and I like the album fairly well overall.  I just think they could have done better.  And a note to other bands that are contemplating a \\""best of\\"" album:  fill the dang thing up!  Why only give me 60 minutes of music here  -  was the other stuff not worthy?<br /><br />Prepare yourself for some great drumming and sax playing, and you'll be happy with this.<br />Personally, I wanted a little bit more...<br /><br />I value interesting music that is played and recorded well.  This cd's rating was based on:<br />Music quality = 8.5/10; Performance = 8.8/10; Production = 8.5; CD length = 7/10<br />Overall score weighted on my proprietary scale = 8.2 (\\""3-1/2 stars\\"")"
1012,5,"People might think this is Madonna's attempt at a hip hop album because of '4 Minutes', but this CD offers a huge array of sound. The urban producers who Madonna brought in to make this project actually manupulated their sound toward her style, and it works great! There are a lot of hot beats and synths in this album, and Madonna always sings a fun melody. My favourite tracks are Give it 2 me, Miles Away, Heartbeat, Incredible, Beat Goes On, Dance 2night, Devil Wouldn't Recgonize you, and Voices... excellent work again Madonna!"
1013,4,"The only reason why I gave this album a 4 out of 5 stars is because of lofty expectations I had before its release. Although I truly enjoy how Everlast just seems to take you for a ride with every album he puts out, I was hoping for a little more hip hop on this album; especially with all the great tracks he puts out with La Coka Nostra. Needless to say, this release stands firmly on how versatile Everlast is as an artist, and how much he's matured ever since his days with the Rhyme Syndicate and solo debut, to House of Pain, to his solo projects and cameos, and of course, now with LCN. A strong and long-awaited album that will surely be revered by any real music fan that appreciates awesome talent. Big up Ev!"
1014,5,"I must start off by saying that I may seem to have a small partiality toward Tears for Fears being that it is a large representation of fond memories from my childhood.  However I should also add that even if I hadn't listened to them as a child I still would find their kind of music alluring.  To put it as a fellow reveiwer did \\""in my mind, there are certain bands or singers who define a decade\\"" and Tears for Fears does just that for the 80's.  I couldn't give you a favorite song off of this album but I could tell you that there are only two tracks that I often find myself skipping, those being track 8 and 12.  It's interesting to me also the kinds of movies that attract and incorporate songs from this album into their soundtrack, such as Real Genius and Donnie Darko -two of the greatest movies in the world of cinema both taking place in the 1980's.  I guess everything that has a connection with Tears for Fears is an awesome product of that era.  hah"
1015,4,"Another fine piece of work from Juliana Hatfield. Great melodies, interesting guitarwork, neat harmonies and thought provoking lyrics and the tunes are catchy.  Highly recommend this!"
1016,1,This CD is just too cheesy. I can't believe I actually paid for it. I'd return it if I could.
1017,5,"I'm eagerly awaiting Hybrid's 4th artist album, and in the meantime, I hope this'll tide me over -- the name leads me to believe there'll be future \\""Soundsystem\\"" installments.    Previous reviews have done a fantastic job of covering the guts, so here's my perspective on what makes this mix stand out amidst a sea of so many DJ mixes.    One of the most distinguishing feature draws from Hybrid's fine pedigree in mixing the film music (orchestral) and dance music (electronic) worlds; it's very easy to sample some string loops and plop them over a beat, not so facile to really weave together a compelling arrangement as they've done with my fave track they've done to this day, \\""Finished Symphony\\"", and more recent collaborations with Harry Gregson-Williams (whose work is expected to sound like Hans Zimmer due to his Media Ventures heritage -- big on the anthems and very action-packed!).    No surprise then, that film scores find themselves alongside ambient glitch here. Andy Page's \\""Yellow Tracksuit\\"" is one of his more subdued selections, and the name seems like a Kill Bill reference -- what's so special about Page is his proclivity for glitchy, obsessively detailed production methods which've influenced Hybrid, BT, and many others.    Speaking of BT, Hybrid share a similar strength of having pop song structure intermingle with experimental electronics, and a likeminded track which highlights this is Trifonic's \\""Parks on Fire\\"". At first, it sounded like it came from BT's This Binary Universe album -- and indeed, I researched and read that Trifonic collaborated with BT on that amazing opuses of modern symphonic-electronic; signature stutters can be heard, serving as an intriguing bedside companion for dark bass stabs that traditionally belong on drum 'n' bass tracks, and chopped-up acoustic instrumentation. WONDERFUL!    Thus, the 1st disc thematically belongs in my mental category of \\""mixes that would suit the soundtrack to a city of the future\\"". There's an overt cyberpunk impression to the work, altho it's never unappealingly claustrophobic. And of course, before you know it (listen to Disc 1 at bedtime; if you're new to \\""this kind\\"" of music, it's unconventional but eclectic), we head into Disc 2... the DANCEY side of things!    Some very catchy floor-fillers which blend into each other here, never losing their identity but riffs like raised hands motivating you to pump your hands into the air. Unlike its more sedate counterpart, Disc 2 is faster and harder-edged. A lot of it makes great driving music.    For example, the Hybrid remix of Longrange's \\""Just One More\\"" could easily be a track on a Wipeout game soundtrack, blazing in the background as you pilot your anti-G racer to history.    Then, there's the pressure-cooker that is Soliquid's \\""Lonesfield\\"", almost delicate (but not fragile) chime elements recalling Gill Norris' \\""Forme\\"". If you loved that classic, you'll also appreciate this catchy indulgence.    Lank's \\""Confrontation\\"" has some of the toughest piano-like meanderings and amped-up handclaps to emerge out of the progressive house scene, never acting pretentious, but it too, serving as an ideal companion on a desert drive. Wild whooshes cue in new sections, only leading you forward...    Finally, in one of my fave moments on either disc, Elite Force's originally beatless \\""Shivva\\"" is overlaid on top of Steffano Greppi's \\""Electro Pop (Ambient Mix)\\"". What's so cool about this is, if you're familiar with Elite Force, you know he's typically associated with tough, rolling breakbeat tracks -- but this unorthodox, gentle cut works a treat atop the closing minutes.    I firmly recommend this flexible delight of a mix, and if you're looking for something that roams into familiar territory but is all too happy to guide you beyond, look no further than Hybrid's Soundsystem 01!"
1018,5,"Gomidas Vartabed (Komitas in Eastern Armenian) was a great composer/ethnomusicologist in his own right, but this is his crowning achievement. In this work, Gomidas conveyed the eternal suffering, pain, joy and jubilation of the Armenian people. This is enhanced by the fact that it was composed during the turbulent and tragic times of 1915-1923 in Turkish Armenia. This is the musical equivalent of Arshile Gorky's \\""Mother and Son\\"" in terms of its solemnity, truth and beauty with an equal amount of mythology surrounding the artist-composer (Gomidas would later go insane from what he saw during 1915-1919 and would never compose again).     The performance of the Sourp Gayane Choir is fantastic; I have never heard a better performance in terms of quality, evenness and correctness of tone. They provide a fine interpretation - although of course it is not to be rivaled by the real thing heard in an Armenian church! I would highly recommend this CD to anyone interested in the Liturgies of Orthodox Church and generally to anyone interested in hearing sacred, historical, beautiful music."
1019,2,"I pre-ordered the album months ago(though I have yet to recieve it yet, I heard the songs online already), bought front section seats to Mayhem, and followed slipknot closely ever since they released the news of their new CD release and tour....    I did not really know much about slipknot until the release of Vol. 3 Subliminal Verses...  When a friend of mine played it, I immediately fell in love with the band, and bought the album for myself, then begun to explorer their previous work, which I liked better and better...  IF you ask me, every year they seem to lose alittle something...  Their first album to me is by far their best with songs like Scissors, and Prosthetics...  The mellowest songs was probably Wait and Bleed...  And still relatively a hard punching song...  The thing I fell most in love with about Slipknot was their style...  They made it clear they were a 9 piece band in their music...  They had a sound developed that was unique, aggressive, different....  All their sound effects, and crafty lyrics, which by the way, they have a pretty complex vocabulary, it all made them the band that earned them the rep they have today....  Most of all I love how Corey Taylor could sing, scream, and sing while screaming....  They had the perfect mixture of melody, aggression, it caught your attention, and revved you up...  Even in their mellower songs like circles, vermillion pt. 2, they still sounded good...  They managed to pull off melodic acoustics, yet maintain some sense of style that still screamed \\""hey, this is Slipknot\\""....    This new album has severely disappointed me...  Maybe the fact this being the first album of theirs I had a chance to look forward to being released, and had high hopes...  As I stated, I started to listen to Slipknot when Vol. 3 came out...  By then, I was playing catch up...  I never had to wait, never had a chance to have any expectations....    The music on their newest release is....  ok at best....  and only if it came from some other band....  But the fact this is Slipknot....  I felt let down...  in a big way...  Take the song Vendetta for instance...  That song nearly sounds semi country....  And worse, it seems to me they captured the sounds from other bands....  Lyrics like \\""Are you ready for the time of your life\\""....  Sounds like Rev Theory....  And what ever happened to \\""I'm gonna slit your throat, and F**k the wound\\"".....  This album seems to me, many main stream radio stations can play these songs....  Most Slipknot songs from other albums are too \\""hard\\"" for the radio...  But this new album almost fits in the \\""Easy Music\\"" section....  They lost their aggression, they lost sound style, they got soft, and though still spit out alot of complex vocabulary, many of their songs almost sound forced and rushed...  I feel Corey Taylor lied when he said quote \\""This Album will rip your face off\\"" end quote....  Maybe I misunderstood...  Maybe he really said \\""It'll make you want to rip your face off\\""....  This album simply is not Slipknot....  In fact, several of the songs I hear a resemblance to other bands such as Stone sour (somewhat), Rev Theory, Godsmack, maybe alittle Metallica, Korn, even papa roach...  Even some 80's sounds...  And Vendetta...  Sounds country like...  For those who like Wrestling (Im not a huge fan, but my brothers are), my brother states Vendetta sounds like \\""RVD's old entrance song\\""...  Ive never heard the song before nor do I know who made it, much less really who RVD is....  But as a point made....    Slipknot drastically changed in this album, and it changes how I look at them drastically...  They being one of my favorite bands have sunk alittle...  Maybe they'll fix this with a better album release....  Or come out and state they were just kidding us with this album....  Joey Joridison even stated this album being their best of work, finally having the sound he's always want slipknot to sound like....  I hope not...    Maybe there are some Maggots out there satisfied with this album, but I venture to say the vast majority are disappointed, or just happy we got at least something from Slipknot released in 4 yrs....  But this is not what I imagined it was going to be as I counted down the days until All Hope is gone was released....  The early release of Psychosocial really did throw everyone off...  Even Psychosocial sounds a bit less like the Slipknot we all know from their past albums....  but at least Psychosocial semi captures Slipknot's style in a little way...  The music video is awesome too....  But it truly is the cream of the crop on this album.    I just can't imagine the 9 of them head banging or even playing in their mean looking masks to any of this music on their new album in concert...  this will probably bring about a huge change in seeing them live...   I hope they get alot of negative reviews, and not because I hate them, but I hope they notice we were unsatisfied and they bring back the old stuff....  Maybe they should have remained in Los Angeles for recording, rather then moving to Iowa...  Should have kept some of their old producers....  Funny though, to me anyhow, every album seems to get worse...  Their first album and Iowa being the best....  And Subliminal Verses being pretty good....  But this new Album just lost it....  I have to agree with the fact maybe theyre beginning to sell out...      As I said, this album is at best \\""ok\\"", if and only if it came from some other band....  But I had higher expectations....  Not that Slipknot plays to please my expectations...  But this is generally what Ive been hearing as well...    Just too drastic of a change too fast....  then again, what can we expect from the psychotic looney bin Slipknot portrayed when they're all approaching 40 years of age...  There is a time they will have to let go...  Too bad they spend long periods of time between albums...    I will miss the creepy sound effects the most...  They hardly sound like a 9 piece band anymore...They defiantly slowed down"
1020,5,"The late soprano Lucia Popp was a real treasure in earthen vessel...she matured over the years from a coloratura to a lyrico-spinto, on several occasions singing different roles from those she had done earlier in the same operas. She NEVER failed to bring joy.........<br /><br />Lucia was born to sing Mozart, and the great composer might well have written with her in mind. This release from at least two LPs is 77'24\\"" of pure perfection. I'll only mention two examples...three cuts from \\""The Marriage of Figaro\\"" show her in three different rolls, all done with beauty and style. The closing \\""Exsultate, jubilate\\"" is as close as we're likely to get to Heaven's music this side of eternity.<br /><br />Lucia was a pure delight, stolen from us by a brain tumor. She never failed to give us her all...grab this, and meet a truly great singer."
1021,2,"This album reminds me of country music when I was a kid.  Unfortunately for me, that's not the kind that I like.  I do like a lot of the more modern country, which is more rock-n-roll and pop than I remember country being back in the 70s and 80s.  There's really only one song on this album that somewhat fits what I like, and that's the last song.  I agree with the others that you should certainly listen to the sample music provided here before deciding to buy.<br /><br />Also, Shane's voice control seems lacking to me.  His baritone voice almost seemed to crack at times, at least on the first couple of songs on the album."
1022,5,Been a fan of Nappy Roots for a long long time now and to see them put together an album this good just really makes me happy.I have listened to the album from start to finish and let me say the beats are sick and the lyrics are even more sick.If your looking for a great album to purchase that just doesn't have 3 or 4 decent songs but you can listen all the way through i recommend buying this Nappy Roots.Highly recommended not only by me but several of my peers.
1023,5,"To whit, \\""Never Assume That This is as Good as It Gets, No Matter How Good It Is.\\""    No kidding. Every couple of years, the woman puts out a new one, and I think, \\""Well, she'll never top this.\\"" And, then, a couple years later she does. Brilliant & beautiful & a decent human being to boot, Dolly is my girly glam heroine, and a reminder to keep on aiming just a little bit higher."
1024,5,I love this song it is my favorite off of Michael's album! it is so good! I also love the fact this single includes the video that is great I love this video to it is so romantic he is fallowing Tatiana Thumbtzen through the streets he will take no for an answer so sweet! also includes a remix of the song:) I love this single buy it if you are an MJ fan or just love music you can't go wrong!:)
1025,5,"I had never heard of Gov't Mule until I saw a documentary on the making of this cd set honoring the late great Allen Woody. The musicianship is incredible giving me hours of listening pleasure. There is everything from Southern style rock to Funk and everything in between. This is because of the injection of some of the best bass players from all areas of the music world. It has caught the ears of many people who have overheard me listening to it making them say, \\""That's great! Who is it?\\"" A must have in my collection!"
1026,4,"Mending is the debut full length CD from Dallas based quintet The New Frontiers (formerly known as Stellamaris).  While some are quick to draw comparisons to the British powerhouse Coldplay, this only tells part of the story.  After spending a few weeks listening to their music I believe that the other main ingredient in their musical stew comes from a band on this side of the Atlantic - Better Than Ezra circa Deluxe (1995).  Like both of the bands to which I compare them, The New Frontiers are not a band that is going to overpower you with crunching guitars or thundering bass and/or drum lines.  Their music is mellow without being passive.  It is introspective without being pretentious or obtuse.<br /><br />Mending opens with highest energy song on the entire CD, Black Lungs.  It is a song that grabs your attention without beating you over the head.  However they essentially take the lights down for the remainder of Mending.  The Day You Fell Apart is a melancholy song about crises and the people who help you get through them.  Sally Gathings adds a rich vocal layer with lead singer Nathan Pettijohn to the chorus while mournful guitars tie the verses and chorus together.  Other standout tracks include Man Down and This Is My Home.<br /><br />Being a freshman effort, I wasn't too surprised that not every track appealed to me.  Mirrors finds its way to a choral/chorus section that calls to mind the Mike & The Mechanics song The Living Years.  While it worked well for Mike & The Mechanics, I thought that it distracted from Pettijohn's otherwise solid vocals.  Then there is the closing track Who Will Give Us Love?.  It comes close to being a 7/11 song - 7 words repeated 11 times.  While the words in question are not offensive (variants of \\""We gotta learn to pray like Jesus\\""), musically it is just bad.<br /><br />All in all, though, this is a solid debut CD from The New Frontiers.  They are definitely a band that shows a lot of promise, and I look forward to hearing their future work.  If you think a blend of Coldplay and Better Than Ezra sounds interesting, give it a spin and let me know what you think.<br /><br />Download this:  The Day You Fell Apartthink a blend of Coldplay and Better Than Ezra sounds interesting, give it a spin and let me know what you think.

1027,5,"I loved this \\""album\\"" back when it first came out.  Steve Hunter plays very diverse styles in this one album ranging from tropical jazz, to hard rock, with some blues and progressive instumental jazz smattered in between.  Steve Hunter played with Alice Cooper, Lou Reed, and Peter Gabriel.    This is an excellent collection of songs from a very under rated musician.  Mr. Hunter,  Thank you for these songs that I associate great memories with back in the late seventies and early eighties."
1028,5,"I may be biased when it comes to Devin townsend, because everything he has done will get a 5/5 from me. Question is WHY am I so biased ? The answer is simply because he is one of the best musicians in the world today. Here is a man who can make progressive rock, death metal, power metal, hard rock, ambient music, and .... techno !!! Sometimes all in the same song !    Terria is an example of how massive, complex and beautiful his music can get. This album will devour you with it's sheer brilliance. I'd recommend getting ALL his albums but Terria is probably his most varied and complex work yet. Although his Ocean Machine or Accelerated evolution are the most accessible and probably the best way to get into Devin's music, Terria is a mountain of music which cannot and should not be missed. Very, very highly recommended !"
1029,3,"I first fell in love with Isobel's voice when she was with Belle & Sebastian, so i had no surprise discovering she was on track. Very charming and deep voice, that bang bang looks like sound i suggest you hear.  I dream to see her on stage with Calexico: how soon?"
1030,5,"PRIDDIS Multiplex 5X5 REBECCA ST. JAMES VOLUME 1 Karaoke CD&G CD from the High Quality PRIDDIS FAITH KARAOKE collection (3031G). This factory manufactured CD comes in a plastic jewel case, plays the music with or without the lead vocals and displays the lyrics on a Karaoke CD&G player. There is also a printed lyrics booklet included so you can use this disk even if you don't have a karaoke player. This CD has 10 tracks total. The first 5 are without vocals and the second 5 are the same songs with guide vocals in one channel for practice purposes. These songs are not preformed by the original artists but are VERY GOOD re-creations."
1031,5,"As much as Steve Perry was Journey, I tried to get into Steve Augeri,made it half way...After listening to Arnel Pineda,I made it  through all the way.He sounds more like Perry,than Perry did.The album is simply,Brilliant...From the first track til the end.Pure heaven!!!!!!! You have the trademark Journey..Ballads,& rockers...As long as you have Jonathan Cain and Neil Schon...You can't go wrong.Their song writing is pure and from the heart...I am a born-again fan...Never Walk Away,Wildest Dream,Faith In The Heartland,Where Did I Lose Your Love,What I Needed & Turn Down The World Tonight highlight this great album.Pure 80's sound and it is so fresh. get it while it's HOT!!!! You will like....A solid 5 stars...WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1032,5,"When your child spontaneously starts singing these songs, and wants you to sing along with him (WITHOUT the CD playing!), you know he loves it.  And he's not even 2 years old.  Whenever we get him strapped into his car seat in the car, he immediatly starts asking for \\""Music!  Music!  Street!  Street!\\"", for sesame street music.  We've got this CD, the new All-Time Favorites one, and Hot Hot Dance songs, and he loves them all.  If your kids like watching Sesame Street, they'll love singing along with the characters to these songs."
1033,5,"This is simply a great, great album.  Beats and lyrics are original and just awesome.  Each song can stand on its own, but its the way they're tied together that makes this album a listening experience that is second to none.      I don't get why this group is relatively unknown - again, this is second to none.  It probably helps if you speak some spanish to appreciate the lyrics, but even if you don't you'll enjoy this.     If you like spanish rap at all - think Kinto Sol, Akwid, etc, you'll love this.  Try this album."
1034,1,"Can't get through this recording due to the lack of appeal, talent, and voice of Sherie Rene Scott. I am baffled at how this woman gets cast. Her voice is bland, she carries a tune, nothing more. When she belts a tune it is merely screeching and screaming. Her acting ability is nil. Have completely disliked her in everything I have seen and heard her do, she is simply awful.<br />The rest of the cast and beefed up score are fine, but I cannot get through the CD due to the horrendous Scott. Stick to the film soundtrack for the glorious Pat Carroll vocals as Ursala. Only wish there were a recording of the show from when Faith Price was playing the sea witch, that would have been terrific. Scott ruins the OBC recording."
1035,3,"I bought it for \\""Good Foot\\"" which is the only track appealing. The other songs are blah.<br />This CD's music isn't for young kids, based on it's content. The computer animated characters are misleading to parents."
1036,5,Maude Maggart is one of my favorite female vocalists.  Even made a road trip from western PA to New York to hear her in person.  I recommend all her CD's.
1037,4,She's still amazing. A gifted voice and a perfect taste to pick her songs.  Enjoy it !
1038,3,"Okay - let me start by saying that I am not a hardcore MSI fan. However, Tight, Frankenstein Girls, and YRTA really grew on me after I was turned onto them a few years ago. But the weird magic of those albums doesn't seem to find its way onto \\""If\\"". I am disappointed that the first half of the CD sounds - well... a bit too formulaic for MSI. Songs like \\""Lights Out\\"" are catchy, but wear out after a couple listens. And if I didn't know any better, the first few seconds of \\""Never Wanted To Dance\\"" might be the beginning of a White Stripes CD in disguise. Fortunately things do pick up starting with \\""Mastermind\\"". Ah, this is more like what I was hoping for. More cheesy yet infectious rapping and less singing. My guess is that they were under pressure to put out a new full-length and just threw together a bunch of filler tracks. Although I'd say the first 8 songs on \\""If\\"" are mediocre, the rest would make a damn fine EP."
1039,5,"Um ... I would say just buy it ... like now.  Gorgeous meld of indie and classic rock sound.  Echoes of My Morning Jacket, Band of Horses, etc. only with more hooks."
1040,5,"A necessary album, specially if you consider that some of the movies included here did not enjoy an exclusive soundtrack. The only problem with this kind of album is that it soon becomes incomplete, specially in the case of Almodovar who has delivered several other pieces after the ones here in this record. Nevertheless, it must be admitted that it fills up a great gap and helps collectors to obtain good recordings of soundtracks impossible to get from any other source. Most important of all, the musical selections are excellent and the recording quality sounds great."
1041,4,"This album is indeed a blessing. Marvin Sapp takes the art into a deep level of worship to where the connection is felt on the inside. Easpecially on tracks like \\""Worshipper in me\\"" and \\""Thirsty\\"" it is a desperately intimate cry of emotion that invites the Spirit and presence of God inside.  I really enjoy this album and the arrangement of the tracks definitely seem to take the listener on a journey.                                Camacho R."
1042,3,"It's alright, it nothing that hasn't been done before, except the wierd Sixx voice overs, it has a Tool New Radicals feel to it. has a sort of Nu Metal AFI feel also."
1043,5,Quality is good to excellent. Has my favorites on it. Checked reviews about other Righteous Brothers CDs and bought based on reviews. Was not disappointed.
1044,3,"I mainly write to confirm what an earlier reviewer suggested: yes, the Handel is a *treacherously* difficult work to sing, perhaps even more for the choir than for the soloists.    This entire recording, btw, is (currently!) up on YouTube. Do a search on \\""handel dixit dominus\\""; it's in four parts, the one with the baldacchino graphic.    I personally think this is a \\""fun\\"" recording of the work, owing to the tempi and the continuo instrumentation. There are a few vocal problems here and there."
1045,5,"This album is excellent, every song is killer.  When this superb album dropped it was a slap in the face to the music scene going on at the time which I salute AC/DC for once again sticking to their rock N roll guns and not becoming a parody of themselves or selling out.  The sound quality is excellent, the songs are well peformed, the songs themselves are great rockers, great riffs, vocals etc as we have come to expect from this legendary band.  Solid release, great remaster!"
1046,5,"In the music industry of today, the vast majority of originality is with those who are unsigned or signed to the independent labels.  Don't buy this CD expecting to hear the fluff that is readily available on the radio.  You won't find it here.      What you will find is an incredible songwriter/singer who is unappreciated and unknown to many besides the hard core that wait for his every release.  The upcoming release of his next CD in on the near horizon and I eagerly wait to hear the next chapter in this talented songwriters journey.    I'm still trying to figure out the \\""Advisory\\"" sticker so don't buy it thinking that this is filled with obscenities.  It isn't.  What it is, is good music.  Stand-outs include - \\""Saints in the Twilight\\"", \\""Jack of Diamonds\\"" and a remake of his former band, The Great Divide's, song \\""Floods\\"".      Great stuff for those that appreciate singer/songwriter material.  Great stuff that doesn't grow old after a listen or two.  Do yourself a favor and try it out.  If you like something a little more mellow then try the acoustic \\""Twelve Pieces\\"" CD."
1047,4,"Being a hardcore Deep Purple fan for 35+ years I knew who Whitesnake was WAY before mainstream America discovered them complements of shallow MTV posing. And by that statement you can tell I was a little disappointed in the hair metal poser direction Coverdale took the band after the late 70s - early 80s line-up broke up; when they changed from a pretty good blues-rock band to just another Led Zep/Sabbath clone band. While I'd never say it wasn't fun to listen to, I really got tired of his shallow posing vanity show and it got to the point where I simply couldn't watch him and preferred just to listen to the CDs instead!<br /><br />And, after hearing the first track on \\""Good to be Bad\\"" I was even more disappointed...heck, it's such a BLATANT rip-off of the Allman Bro's classic \\""Whipping Post\\"", with a different chorus, it's nothing less than disgusting!! The verse phrasing, even the organ itself is such an exact copy I expected to hear David sing \\""sometimes I feel, sometimes I FEEL...\\"" at any moment!! While I do think it's a catchy tune and definitely listenable I thought, wow...here he goes ripping other bands off again, not an original idea in his head!!<br /><br />But, as the other tracks played I became more and more impressed and track #5, the title track, sunk its hook in me on the very first listen!! So now I have to say that I am impressed and heartily agree with my fellow reviewers...Coverdale and the boys have produced a heck of a come back album!! In fact I wouldn't hesitate to say it's one of the best comebacks I have ever heard!!! And I'm telling everyone I know about it too!<br /><br />As mentioned above, track #5 \\""Good to be Bad\\"" is nothing less than one of the GREATEST  Whitesnake songs I have ever heard and \\""Best years\\"" (the Whipping Post clone), \\""Call On Me\\"", \\""Lay Down Your Love\\"", \\""A Fool In Love\\"" and \\""Got What You Need\\"" are also already on my MP3 player!<br /><br />Bottom line: if you are a Whitesnake fan, GET THIS! Get it immediately!! And if you like good rock in any form, even if you were never a snake fan, get it anyway!! And crank it up!!!if you were never a snake fan, get it anyway!! And crank it up!!!"
1048,5,"First time I came across KT Tunstall, was after watching the movie the Devil Wears Prada, which I loved for the fast-paced reality it portrayed  and that I myself live in everyday. I basically loved all the music in it and was looking to buy the soundtrack originally but came across the wird fact that one of my favorite songs of the movie WAS NOT actually in the soundtrack so I decided to do some research and came across TD Tunstall.I herd the amazon samplers and pretty much found I loved her entire album, so I ended up buying it and loving it everyday.This is a definite must buy for the busy business woman trying to make her day a a fun one.Higly recommended."

1050,5,"Why is this band not popular?  I just don't get the music industry...  Riverside does everything perfectly in their debut.  Brillant musicianship, composition, and vocals.  Their progressive song writing means the songs never get old; I love this cd (and their other cds) more with every listen.  In Two Minds (a breathtaking ballet), Out of Myself (more their typical sound), and Loose Heart (a bit 80's sounding, but awesome) are my favorites.   Riverside does not sound like any other band, so there is no point in trying to describe them or saying that if you like band X you'll like Riverside.  Just check them out (Loose Heart is on their myspace page).  They may be your new favorite band."
1051,5,"Ron Sexsmith is a truly gifted songwriter, in terms of both melody and lyrics. So easy to say, so hard to find."
1052,5,"I purchased \\""Float\\"" as a gift for my \\""20-something\\"" son, and he loves it. Unfortunately, I haven't heard it myself (he's in Hawaii & I'm in NY)."
1053,5,I am just filling out my CD library with titles I used to have in album format and through the years have lost or they have gotten unplayable. Great album though.
1054,5,"[[ASIN:B000UPWO5E A Christmas Celebration]]Watching this DVD was a delight; it gave me the feeling of joy and  peace; all the performers were great singers, whether singing solo or as a group."
1055,5,"I was nosing around for artists I had not heard and came across the Damnwells. Wow - was I surprised. I am a huge audiophile and lsiten to alot of stuff, I was very impressed with Air Stereo - keep coming back to it. As usual there are camps between this album and previous releases (which I have not listened to yet) - all I can say is this one hell of an album on all fronts and I am not one to give 5 stars easily..."
1056,4,"I'm guessing Bach would prefer that we hear his works in context, with all the glories that his pacing and structure reveal. Nonetheless, this is a very nicely assembled collection of quieter pieces that are indeed conducive to reading. Free of the crescendoes that might distract from the book at hand (not that Bach was Mahler), this is perfect background music for reading or eating or just staring out the window at clouds drifting by.<br /><br />Rather prosaic to take perhaps history's greatest composer and cut him up into soundbites, but that said, I read for five hours last night with this on repeat and it was a fine experience. I wouldn't have bought this, but as a gift it was quite welcome.<br /><br />There are of course hundreds of complete classical pieces that serve the same purpose beautifully (Satie, Handel and Debussy come immediately to mind), but this does its job well and leaves the mind soothed and relaxed by music of the highest order, and that can't be a bad thing."
1057,4,"From the opening lyric of \\""Into the Ocean,\\"" Blue October grabs you with its unique sound, the throbbing beat and complex lyric, \\""I'm just a normal boy that sank when I fell overboard.  The ship would leave the country.  But I'd rather swim ashore.  Without a life vest, I'd be stuck again; Wish I was much more masculine.\\""  The catchy hook is addictive.  My other favorite on this disc is \\""X Amount of Words\\"" that is lyrically jammed with Justin Furstenfeld's breathy vocals and stadium crowd sound effects, \\""Systematic, sympathetic, quite pathetic, apologetic, paramedic, your heart is prosthetic.\\""  The tracks are so original that they jump out of the speakers.  \\""Let It Go\\"" & \\""She's My Ride Home\\"" also capture attention.  \\""Foiled\\"" is a great disc!  \\""Enjoy!\\"""
1058,5,"Ever since I discovered Vitas, he is a part of my life.  I can't live without his music! His voice is just amazing - pure, powerful, and beautiful.  I am never tired of hearing this CD.  His music videoes are also awesome.  He is such a great artist who is talented in many ways.  He is the treasure of the world, no doubt about it."
1059,5,"KARL ULRICH SCHNABEL (1909-2001)had a career in teaching and performing that spanned the bulk of the twentieth century.The earliest recording in this collection is from 1931 - Chopin's Rondo in C Major for two pianos, with Leanoard Shure. The most recent was made in 1996 - two Dvorak works for one piano four hands, with Joan Rowland.     Except for Mozart, the repertoire here ranges through the nineteenth century, including a shimmering \\""Au Bord D'une Source\\"" from the \\""Annéés de Pélérinage\\"" by Liszt. But my favorites are an incandescent performance of Mendelssohn's  Sonata in E Major, op. 6 and Mozart's Andante with Variations in G, K 501 for piano four hands, with Helen Schnabel."
1060,4,"Ryan Tedder is the hottest thing in the music world right now. Everything he seems to touch either turns to gold, or mush. Whether it's the current #1 \\""Bleeding Love,\\"" Ashley Tisdale, or even Blake Lewis. And if that wasn't enough, his own band has been the phenomenon on the phenomenon MySpace. But due to all that success, Tedder still wasn't ready to put out an album for the band. But then came \\""Apologize\\"" remixed by Timbaland, and even though they didn't have a big credit for the phenomenon, they took the cover of Rolling Stone, and became the biggest thing in music. Then they realized they didn't have an album out. The result, is the best pop/rock CD of the year, and certainly the surprise album of the year.<br /><br />The album starts off amazing with, \\""Say (All I Need)\\"" which takes on an epic feel all its own, and immediately gets you drawn into the album. \\""Mercy\\"" could be considered extremely radio-friendly, and standard pop/rock fare, but as a album song, not on radio, the song actually works quite well But if the song ever did cross the line, than love with the song would quickly sink.<br /><br />Their current phenomenon, \\""Stop and Stare\\"" which seems like it's fixing to crack the top 10 of the carts, and for good reason. The song has a very nice structure, starting off slow, before building up to, and taking off at the chorus in an unexpectedly amazing effort, that could be the highlight of the CD.<br /><br />The original version of \\""Apologize\\"" is next, which starts off with violins, and a soft piano, with a slow clapping in the background. The only thing really different between this and the remix is Timbaland. I personally don't care for this version, reminding me more of Fort Minor's \\""Remember the Name,\\"" without the rap. This version is also somewhat less emotional, as it seems pretty straight-up.<br /><br />\\""Goodbye Apathy\\"" is also pretty straight-up, and the structure stays relatively the same throughout the song, without really ever taking off. \\""All Fall Down\\"" continues the trend, and ends up seeming overdrawn and rather boring. \\""Tyrant\\"" starts off good, starts to fall apart towards the end, as again, it's too drawn out. But it a shortened version could be good for rock radio.<br /><br />\\""Prodigal\\"" could again be better on structure, and somewhere towards the beginning of the song, it takes some elements from, \\""Across the Universe,\\"" which may sound strange, but it's there. \\""Won't Stop\\"" gets the album back on its feet again with an upbeat, poppy tune that is again one of the highlights of the CD. \\""All We Are\\"" hints at some country pop elements in its verses, but jumping to its chorus, which feels uneven, but still winds up good.<br /><br />\\""Someone to Save You\\"" actually continues another bad trend of bad song titles that are again, overdrawn. The song would have been better if it was titled, 'Honesty'. But for the song itself, yet another highlight that is well-done from verses to chorus, to bridge, and back again. And at the last minutes of the song, it has with an amazing ending, that takes elements of The Beatles, The Afters, and mixes in themselves for good measure, making for an amazing song.<br /><br />\\""Come Home\\"" is a piano driven track that is exactly what type of song as its amazingly accurate title says. An emotional song that some may criticize for being unoriginal, but it's still good with its rather impressive chorus. And for the 13th track, we have the song that started the phenomenon, the remixed version of, \\""Apologize.\\"" Simply put, no apologies needed with this song.<br /><br />Overall, a great debut, and probably the best thing to come out of MySpace. An impressive band that is still searching for their sound, which makes for many a hit, but just as many a miss. The best pop/rock album of 2007, and I'll be looking forward for the follow-up album, and the continued success of OneRepublic.<br /><br />But wait! That's not all! If this review wasn't long enough, there's bonus tracks that you'll find if you get the album from venues such as Target. I imagine you could also find them on their MySpace also. Since there's so many, here's the best of them.<br /><br />Dreaming Out Loud: Surprisingly, the title track isn't part of the actual album, but still a very good song that has more of a darker tone in its verses, before breaking into a rather impressive chorus that doesn't fail to impress, before going back to its verses that don't seem to fit the song.<br /><br />Hearing Voices: Another impressive track that is actually better than most of the songs on the actual album. The verses are great, and the chorus is soft but powerful, making for a great listen overall. And again, this song has a great structure.find them on their MySpace also.

1061,5,"This little 3-track gem is worth getting just for the last song, \\""Paint a Pretty Picture.\\"" Everyone thinks of Tal Bachman as the one-hit wonder behind \\""She's So High,\\"" but allow me to assure you, that's not the whole story! While that song certainly has its merit, it is nothing compared to the raw, passionate tones of \\""Paint...\\"" The whole song is unabashedly ardent & unbridled, without losing any of Tal Bachman's signature smoothly melodic tones. A complete win!!"
1062,3,"Back in late 1995, Coolio had his most popular single \\""Gangsta's Paradise\\"" floating all through the airwaves. I must have been about 10 years old, and managed to learn that song in under an hour (almost 13 years later, I can barely remember any of the words). Coolio wasn't really the greatest rapper from the west coast, but the single \\""Gangsta's Paradise\\"" was the jump that he needed to place himself to where he wanted to be in the rap game.<br /><br />True, when you think of his name, that single pops up, but there was just more than that single that made him a good rapper. In fact a lot of the tracks bang, as Coolio talks mostly about the streets of L.A. \\""Ghetto Highlites\\"" is a song how he talks about life in the ghetto. \\""Too Hot\\"" is a great song about people being burned while not using protection using the Kool And The Gang song. Then he has some bouncy tracks like \\""1,2,3,4 (Sumpin' New)\\"" which does sound a little cheesy but to me it's good.<br /><br />Guest appearances are good though. I like \\""Crusin\\"" featuring Malika. E-40, Kam, and Coolio's group 40 Thevez colab for \\""Exercize Yo Game\\"". And W.C., 40 Thevez, Shorty, and Ras Kass, appear on \\""Get Up, Get Down\\"". All dope songs. My favorite song on this album would be Coolio colabing with Will Wheaton on the song \\""Bright As The Sun\\"".<br /><br />Although good album, it flaws heavily. I personally think this album has too many recognizable interpolations, which makes the song sounds so cheesy. A perfect example would be \\""A Thing Going On\\"", uses the chorus to \\""Me and Mrs. Jones\\"". \\""Kinda High and Drunk\\"" is another bad song.<br /><br />Gangsta's Paradise is a very good album. It was one of the biggest highlight albums in late '95 carried over to '96. Unfortunately back then this album was played into the ground, and people were tired of Coolio (which might explain why his next album [[ASIN:B000000HLQ My Soul]] didn't sell like he wanted to). I wouldn't necessarly call Coolio a gangsta rapper. He just happened to be from the west and blew up when gangsta rap was at it's peak.

1064,4,It's been almost two years since this album was reviewed but I thought people should have an update  The last review in 2006 said that most of these songs were not attached to a superstar I can now tell you that only two of the songs on this album are not superstar themes  Here they are and who entrance theme they are  1. I walk alone          Batista  2. Burn in my light      Randy Orton  3. Hard Hittin           Coach  4. Crank it up           Big Show (harder version of his old theme)  5. Holla             Kelly Kelly (listed as Candice but was used for Kelly  6. A Girl Like That      Torrie Wilson  7. Quien So Yo         was going to be used for Carlito thankfully wasn't  8. Deadly Game          9. I'm Comin'       Now used as MVP's entrance theme  10. Fury of the Storm   RVD used it once but changed back to one of a kind  11. Some Bodies Gonna Get It   Mark Henry  12. With Legs Like That        Maria  13. This Fire Burns           Now used as C.M. Punk's entrance theme  14. Booyaka 619               Rey Mysterio  15. King of Kings             Triple H    As you see most of these songs did become entrance themes so in all you get 13 entrance themes in all.
1065,5,"What is the 20th Century all about? How about the 21st Century? It's about Mr. David Hasselhoff. He is the defining voice, the defining face of the here, and the of the now. What more can I say? I LOVE you Dave!"
1066,4,"if you like carrie underwood this will be your favorite cd. favorite song, the more boys I meet...the more I love my dog. lol."
1067,5,"I first came across Krista's music in a restaurant in Norfolk, VA back in 2005. Since then I've been a big supporter of hers, and have watched her continue to grow as an artist, been delighted with what she's produced.     This is a paraphrasing of an email I sent her last summer, after she'd been kind enough to send me an advance copy of 'Cover Their Eyes':    'Cover' seems a perfect transition from 'Mudshow'. It's got the smokey vocals, the over-the-shoulder insouciance, and the 'I know this, did you?' observations that charm, that beguile, that quietly enrapture.    Hre voice sounds as lush as ever, soft-edged, but somehow commanding attention, and what she's singing about is poetically lyrical...yet poignantly relevant.    At times there's a hitch-step to her style, at others she clearly sashays...and then there are the dirges. But shot through is a kind of unimposing...well, for want of a better word, 'sensuality'. (And I do love her playfulness, especially on 'Anemic Moon'.)    The production seems more austere, well-chosen...but not 'fashioned'. What's there, fits. And fits impeccably well.    I love this album. And have already begun spreading the word. I'm sure it's going to push her to a more elevated status.    Congratulations are in order for a wonderful musical offering!"
1068,5,"I'm so glad to see Vicki's only recording being released on CD.  I only wish it had the original artwork.  However, it still sounds great!"
1069,5,"This is one of the best old time gospel collections I have ever heard and has superb remastering. The production is really outstanding. I rate this along side the How Can I Keep From Singing series in content, but the sound is better. This is most highly recommended."
1070,4,"I heard this album after my initial exposure to [[ASIN:B00005K9ZU Horror Show]], so I had some pretty high expectations of \\""Dark Saga\\"". I have to admit, except for a few tracks, the initial response from me was one of disappointment. There was something lacking in the punch and impact of \\""Dark Saga\\"" that \\""Horror Show\\"" pounded away at you with. That is not to say that the CD was bad, there were decent tracks that were instant winners in my mind.<br /><br />\\""Violate\\"" struck me as an instant winner: punchy, staccato and violent, which is everything metal should be. Also, Matt Barlow's vocals are wildly good on this track. \\""The Hunter\\"" is another powerful song, which savage power chords and vocals combining to create a massive sound punctuated with softer breaks througout. \\""The Last Laugh\\"" shares in the machine-gun impact of solid chords in the choruses.<br /><br />Songs that only grew on me over time include \\""I Died For You\\"" and some of the cycle of songs in \\""The Suffering\\"". I think this was more due to personal taste, especially after reading some of the reviews here.<br /><br />As far as the whole \\""Spawn\\"" theme goes, I have no idea, as I have never been one for graphic novels, and so have only a rudimentary knowledge of that character. However, \\""Dark Saga\\"" is definitely in keeping with Iced Earth's penchant for dark fantasy and powerful metal sounds. If you are into that type of theme, then I would certainly suggest \\""Dark Saga\\"" as a purchase for you.<br /><br />Although not their best CD in my opinion, ([[ASIN:B000005HM9 Burnt Offerings]] was a bit better, in my honest opinion), I still think that fans of Iced Earth will not be disappointed in it. If you find that you are a bit let down on the first listening, give it time. As with me, I think the CD will grow on you and become on of your favourites.<br /><br />I genuinely enjoy listening to this CD. Throughout the songs and the CD as a whole, there is a great range and variety of sound, from raging metal and fury to the much softer and melancholy end of things. It is an album that showcases Iced Earth's undoubted skills as a band and a premier heavy metal act. Fans, new and old alike, will enjoy this one.things.

1071,2,"I am a die hard Dells fan but even I chose not to own this cd album. The songs are not bad, the vocal performances are o.k. but the musical backing tracks are disturbing, simulated, synthetic, synthesizer sounds. How this cd ended up on Stax label is a mystery to me but maybe this is why Stax went belly up. The Dells could have done much better than this."
1072,4,"I feel that JEW is growing up and learning at the same time. I can heard several good things coming from their previous albums. All songs are good, while each song can be played again and again all day long. In my opinion, it's not one of the best albums but it's close to it. I promise to you that if you buy this you never will feel disappointed, even if you are not a JEW fun."

1074,5,"Lets be clear. Freeway's album is the best hip hop album out this year. Not 50, not Kanye, and sorry to say not even my favorite Jay-Z. I can listen to every track on the album and never think about skipping. Freeway eats soul beats for breakfast. He is one of the best when it comes to the genre. Jay has molded Free from a promising artist to a great MC. The ROC is Back and they aint playing no games. With the graduation selling like it did, Jay releasing his best album(American Gangster) since the black album, Freeway follows the leaders, but is clearly a leader himself. I cant say listen to this track or this track simply because they all are fire. If you love real hip hop, cop it  IT's THE ROC!!!!!!!!"
1075,5,"I loved the Four Seasons as a kid, and I'm still enjoying their music.  Frankie Valle sings like no other with the voice of an angel"
1076,5,"This new album by Gloria Estefan is another showcase of her incomparable talent as an artist of this unique genre \\""son cubano\\"" which she has elevated to yet another level. This album is another tribute to the essence of this genre and Latin music in general. One will always dare to compare and ask if Gloria can produce another stellar album like Mi Tierra, well I will say she has done it and the two albums should not be compared. This one continues where Gloria left off. It's filled with that singular mix of Latin rhythms that Gloria masters so well combined with nostalgic lyrics for her homeland, Cuba. I had no doubt that this production would be another top notch album, I just wondered which song would be the most outstanding. While the whole cd can be played non stop, I have to recognize #5- Caridad, #7- Besame, #11-Volvere, and #12- Esperando as exponents of tremendous Latin music. Cuba, Cuba.. algun dia seras libre. Felicitaciones Gloria."
1077,5,"this music realy gets me going.  emotionaly and artisticly.   Great job,  keep it up!"
1078,3,"Dare I say it, but I think Gary is a better when he's depressed.  But then again, most artists are better when they have problems.  Great art usually comes from great pain.  There were probably too many feel-good songs for my liking on this CD and they kind of come across as nothing more than standard country pop.  Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy songs that make you feel good, but this seems to be new territory for Gary Allan and I'm not sure if it works for him.  I didn't hear anything that really stood out on this CD and thought a lot of it was just fogettable fluff."
1079,5,I loved this record in the 80s. The funny thing is that bush's usa is even more facsistier than reagan's ever was.
1080,1,"I love A.K. and R.P. but this album is awful, I hate it.  I sold it the very next day after I bought it."
1081,1,"Just repackaged tunes from albums you probably already have. The two new tracks--the final two on the album--aren't very good, either. Definitely not what I was hoping for."
1082,5,"Pink Floyd's fifth album Atom Heart Mother was released in October of 1970.<br />Atom Heart Mother was one of the band's more daring to date and was one their best in their so-called transitional period. I remember first getting this on cassette tape from my dad in August of 1987 and was just in awe on how great this album was and still is today (I have the remastered CD now).<br />Pink Floyd's history is really divided in five parts. First was the Syd Barrett era (1966-68), next was the transitional era (1968-70), then it was the classic Floyd era (1971-75), followed by the Waters era (1976-83) and lastly the post-Waters era (1987-2008).<br />Atom Heart Mother was recorded at Abbey Road Studios and was produced by Pink Floyd and engineered by Peter Bown and Alan Parsons.<br />The album begins with the 23 and a half minute title cut which took up the whole of the first side of the original album and combined classical with rock with funk with avant-garde and was split into six parts (\\""Father's Shout\\"" (with low E chord going into the track), \\""Breast Milky\\"" (with the cello playing alongside Roger Waters' bass and Rick Wright's organ before giving away to some great overdubbed guitar work from David Gilmour and stellar drumming by Nick Mason), \\""Mother Fore\\"" (which introduces us to the John Aldiss Choir), \\""Funky Dung\\"" (my favorite section of the piece which combined David's guitar soloing with the choir doing some off-the-wall chants and worked excellent), \\""Mind Your Throats Please\\"" (included some mellotron from Rick and tape effects which predates Dark Side) and the piece concludes with \\""Remergence\\"" which was a summary of all of the parts of the album). The piece was written by all four Floyd members and Ron Geesin whom wrote the choral and orchestral parts on the track and worked with Roger on his solo debut Music From the Body.<br />The second half of the album/CD contained three shorter tracks starting with Waters' ballad \\""If\\"" which is a great song and he would subsequently play it live on his Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking and Radio KAOS tours. Next is Wright's \\""Summer 68\\"" and is one of his best numbers. We then have the atmospheric Gilmour masterpiece \\""Fat Old Sun\\"" which was his first song he penned lyrics for by himself and is a beautiful song. The song would be resurrected for David Gilmour's unplugged concerts in London in 2001 and 2002 which is documented on his David Gilmour in Concert DVD and played it on his 2006 tour which is on the Remember That Night DVD and on his 2008 Live in Gdansk album. The album concludes with the 13 minute instrumental \\""Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\"" which is a homage to Floyd's then roadie Alan Stiles and a collage of music and sound effects like water dripping, eating food, cooking and mumbling (eggs, bacon, marmalade) all recorded in Nick Mason's kitchen. The song is split in three parts (\\""Rise and Shine\\"" (which combined piano, hi-hat, guitar and organ), \\""Sunny Side Up\\"" (which is all acoustic guitar and sounds like an early version of \\""A Pillow of Winds\\"" which would appear on the band's next disc Meddle) and \\""Morning Glory\\"" (which has the intro to Rise and Shine that gives way into a jam and concludes with the water dripping)).<br />Atom Heart Mother was a sign of great things to come for the band and was the band's second disc to crack the American Top 100 peaking at a modest #55 and eventually went Gold in later years.<br />This was another stepping stone to the band's eventual world domination despite the fact that most of the band despise this album.<br />Now in 2011, as part of the Why Pink Floyd campaign, the Atom Heart Mother album is re-released in a brilliantly remastered CD version done by James Guthrie and Joel Plante. Also, the artwork restores just about everything that came with the original vinyl album.<br />Highly recommended!equently play it live on his Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking and Radio KAOS tours.

1083,5,"This is a great remastered version of a great reflective CD by a great progressive pop-rock band. Supertramp are, I believe, highly underrated, possibly because of their commercially-attuned, easy-on-the-ears music, but that's our loss. This band had much more talent than most of the bands that were new in 1977 (I can do without the Sex Pistols, thank you very much), and the songs on their 1974-1979 albums imply that living in an upper-class neighborhood like Cape Elizabeth, ME; Western Multnomah County, OR; or certain parts of Seattle/King County, WA isn't as great as it seems. I know this because when I lived in that type of neighborhood as part of a special program, my neighbors sided with authority figures against my fellow students and me because of the whole \\""nimby\\"" (Not In My BackYard) attitude. This is a CD that any fan of progressive music must own."
1084,4,"When I first heard Playaz Circle on Golden Grain track 7 \\""Play pen to the State Pen\\"" 5 yrs ago I couldn't wait to hear their first album. I didn't know it would take 5 yrs, but it's a solid effort."
1085,5,"Without a doubt, Bear McCreary's finest work to date, though I could sense that throughout Season 3 itself. I'm constantly amzed by the shear variety of arrangement, instrumentation and moods McCreary uses and conveys in his score, and this CD reminds us that his contribution to the show is as important as the SFX, the writing, production and acting. McCreary will be a force to be reckoned with for decades to come. I do have one minor complaint, but won't take away a star. Possibly the most important musical segment of S3 was that in the \\""Crossroads\\"" finale. Although this adaptation of \\""All Along the Watchtower\\"" is a remarkable piece, I too would have like to have had the mix as it was used in the show itself. As it stands here, it just doesn't have that same epic feel as it did in the finale."
1086,1,"I have purchased every 50 cent album that has been released to date.  I have never found him to be a good lyricist, but have always found the albums entertaining.  The beats were always good and the flow of the album always seemed flawless.  This album seemed flat almost all the way through.  Obviously his life has changed greatly since the start of his career, I wish his writing would advance as his career does.  This album is the same old story over and over and over and over again.  Plus the flow seems stale.  I honestly don't think I will even give this album a second listen.  Boooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1087,5,"On a friend's recommendation, I only recently rediscovered Dave Mason (former lead singer for Traffic).  These are older cuts, from when he first went solo, but they are great, and the recording quality is excellent.  If you ever liked Traffic or Dave Mason, you should add this CD to your collection.  Recommended!"
1088,5,"GREAT !!!!  Fun, tunes that make you feel like you can escape wherever you are into happy land!"
1089,5,"I'm a big Tain fan - of his recent stuff mostly - and I love, love, love this album. I'm a huge Kenny Garrett fan so having the two of them together is awesome. And man - David Gilmour - holy crap he's awesome. Love it.<br /><br />If you liked Christian McBride's Live at Tonic, this album will be a fun one for you as well (and vice versa I would expect)."
1090,5,"I bought this on cassette tape when it first came out.  Yes, it is a very different sound from the \\""Classic\\"" Queen everyone was use to but the lyrics and music are very good. I like how Queen re-invents themselves with this album. It was led by other songs like, Another One Bites the Dust, & Dragon Attack, these songs showed a preview of what was to come, Hot Space! The songs on this album are all catchy and sound great.  I find myself sometimes singing several of these songs in my head.  I know that I wore the tape out when I had it then and will do the same with the CD.      1 Staying Power - Great song.  It is so dirty and kind of sexy at the same time.  I love the horn arrangement.  2 Dancer  3 Back Chat   4 Body Language - I like how this song is laid out.  Especially, the band break that just has the snapping of fingers.  I can just picture \\""West Side Story.\\""   5 Action This Day  6 Put Out the Fire - Chalk one up for Queen.  This is a very blatant anti-gun song.  I sure not one of the NRA's favs.  7 Life Is Real (Song for Lennon)- A very nice and lyrical tribute to my favorite Beatle.   8 Calling All Girls   9 Las Palabras de Amor (The Words of Love)  10 Cool Cat   11 Under Pressure - What can be said about this song that hasn't already been said! This is great song that is always being played on the local Classic Rock stations.  It is also on the David Bowie CD - Best of Bowie.  I also like the cover art.  It stands out and I know that is not something that one takes in account when buying a CD but I think is does look great.    Overall, I love this album.  I consider it one of my \\""Classic Rock\\"" albums to go along with my other Queen albums.  It is a great buy and I think you will find yourself listening to it over and over again.  If you like great 80s rock/dance music this is the album to get."
1091,4,"There's no disputing Ann Wilson's rock pedigree. Along with the likes of Stevie Nicks, Pat Benatar and Linda Ronstadt, Wilson and her sister Nancy dominated the rock world during the mid-to-late 70's and much of the 80's, proving, (at least to a degree) that women could definitely hang with the boys in that exclusive, male-dominated club that's known as rock and roll. Long percolating, a solo album from the elder Wilson sister has been rumored to be in the works since at least the mid-80's. Unfortunately, HOPE & GLORY only partially satisfies any early expectations. Essentially a covers album - the disc closes with a Wilson original - Ann has chosen a batch of tunes that, for the most part, are as relevant today as when they were first recorded by others. Still, it's a mixed bag ~ some work in their updated format, while others prove that certain classics should just be left alone. Things kick off with \\""Goodbye Blue Sky\\"", a Pink Floyd song that Wilson has been performing for years with Heart. There's an atmospheric, intoxicating vibe to the track, what with it's slightly eerie arrangement, forboding lyrics and nuanced, perfectly modulated lead vocal. Toss in some strong backing vocals from little sis Nancy (still her best duet partner!) and you have a powerhouse cut that could very easily be mistaken for a killer Heart original! Up next is \\""Where To Now St. Peter?\\"" Wilson brilliantly holds her own against Sir Elton, who provides a steely co-lead vocal and some blistering piano runs that dominate, but never overpower, the track. WOW! Equally strong is \\""Jackson.\\"" An earthy, Appalachian-grooved front porch strummer, the track transports you to another time and place. Wilson turns in one of her best vocals to date, and she's aided and abetted by k.d. lang, who provides a harmony vocal that is absolutely stunning. Lovely. Simply lovely! Not as strong is the next trio of tracks. Turning \\""We Gotta Get Out Of This Place\\"" into the story of an abused mother and daughter was a novel idea, and Wynonna Judd delivers a clear, clean co-lead vocal. Wilson, however, falls back on a technique (bad habit?) that has plagued her off and on throughout her career, particularly in the late 70's and early 80's.....she howls, sort of like a banshee scream. Working with producer Ron Nevison in the mid-80's, Wilson learned how to rein it in, only using said....wail....when it was MOST effective. Unfortunately, this problem has reared it's ugly head again in the last few years....it's almost as if, as she nears 60, Wilson feels this is the way to prove she can still \\""rock.\\"" Well, it isn't, and \\""We Gotta.....\\"" is a prime example ~ an otherwise perfect track is marred by a lead vocal that is sub-par at best (In all fairness, Wilson's vocal on the choruses is much better!). The less said about \\""Immigrant Song\\"" the better. Going more militaristic, i.e. even more percussive, or the exact opposite - more acoustic - might have worked, but right now the cut just comes off as a pale rip-off of the original. The strings are a MAJOR misstep, while Wilson's vocal once again ends up running wild. That's the tricky thing about covers....if you can't improve upon the original, or at least bring something new to the table....leave it alone! There's a dark, mournful quality to \\""Darkness, Darkness\\"" that is strangely appealing but, ultimately, the song ends up going nowhere (I think \\""rocking\\"" it up for the last two third's of the track was a mistake; better to have stuck with the opening \\""mountain\\"" vibe!). Things get back on track with Wilson's clever take on \\""Bad Moon Rising.\\"" This classic rocker is turned into a toe-tappin' hoe-down fling....and it works! The instrumentation is crisp, the arrangement clever, while the vocals are spirited and full of fun. Wilson sounds relaxed and at ease, and she's matched note for note by Gretchen Wilson, who provides a harmony and co-lead vocal that is among the disc's best! I could definitely see Heart adding this song to future concert set lists! Alison Krauss provides an angelicly gorgeous guest vocal on Neil Young's \\""War Of Man.\\"" Unfortunately, it's waaaaay too abbreviated. Wilson's lead starts off sexy and seductive, but then she veers off course, going all shrill and shouty once again. And that's a shame, because there's a nice groove going on here, including a kicking arrangement and soaring choruses. A good track that could have been a great one. \\""Get Together\\"" has a lovely Heart vibe to it, with Nancy Wilson supplying a perfect harmony vocal, while Wynonna and Deana Carter provide backing vocals that are pure bliss. Another high point! \\""Isolation?\\"" Not so much! Instead of the screechingly ear-splitting arrangement that it builds up to, I would have rather seen a smokier, torchy take. Another major misstep! \\""A Hard Rain's A Gonna Fall\\"" is a nice blending of the vocal stylings of Wilson, Rufus Wainwright and Shawn Colvin that results in a hypnotic, lovely musical mosaic. Closing out the album is \\""Little Promises, Little Lies\\"", a Wilson/Ben Mink original. This subdued stunner features an unadorned arrangement, smooth lead vocal and powerful lyrics (\\""Standing on a ledge/Out here on the edge/The moon is hanging high/And it fills my dying eyes/Little promises, little lies\\""). Very nice. So, what's my final judgement on HOPE & GLORY? Well, I certainly think Ann Wilson's talent is undeniable, but definitely most evident when she's not trying to prove anything. I'm on the fence about her working with producer Mink again, either solo or with Heart...on the one hand, I like the non-rock/standard Heart production techniques and genres he brings to the mix. On the other hand, I just don't know if he's strong enough to rein in some of Wilson's baser vocal histrionics. I guess all we can do is wish...and pray....and HOPE.

Beautiful lyrics & haunting melodies from the movie of the same name will leave you stunned, wanting to listen again & again--then suddenly you find youself singing along too!  This collaboration of two diverse musical talents is exquisite and thoroughly entertains even if you have not seen the movie.  But--do yourself a favor and treat yourself to both!

1093,5,"I am very pleased that Ms. Bailey Rae sings out of pure heart[[ASIN:B000HBK3MM Corinne Bailey Rae]] and does not see her body as means for selling her music.  I heard her song \\""Trouble Sleeping\\"", on the radio, and thought an angel was singing.  I have heard her interviews and like the way she presents herself.  Though young, North Americans like Beyonce could learn a lot from her.  The songs and messages of hope and saintliness are what's needed.  Bodies girating with tattoo's and naked promotes dirty countries. All of her songs are easy to listen to and one feels clean or cleansed while and after listening, this one. Thanks for the PURITY Corinne."
1094,5,"We love this CD! In the busyness of last minute baby preparations, Lullaby Island brings us back home to the preciousness of the moment and awaiting the arrival of our little one. Julia Norton's gorgeous vocals soothe and transport...inviting us to sing, dance and dream the future!"
1095,5,"THIS CD IS JUST AWESOME. THERE IS NO OTHER WORD FOR IT. PASTOR SAPP HAS TRULY CAPTURED THE ESSENCE OF GOD ON THIS CD AND I CAN'T STOP PLAYING IT. IF YOU HAVE NOT PURCHASED THIS CD, YOU MUST DO SO TODAY. EVERYTIME I THINK I HAVE A FAVORITE, IT CHANGES WHEN I HEAR THE NEXT TRACK. I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH HOW IMPERATIVE IT IS FOR YOU TO PURCHASE THIS CD. IT WILL TRULY BLESS YOU."
1096,4,"Michael Frant's poetry is at once timely and timeless.  He uses current, hard hitting, political images and themes to express an open-minded, inclusive, compassionate philosophy that makes me feel like simply listening to him is a step toward a more peaceful, generous world.    I'm 55; this album was recommended to me by a couple of 23 year olds.  And while \\""Yell Fire!\\"" is all about a driving stand up and be counted rhythm, \\""One Step Closer to You\\"" is the perfect mellow choice for a Middle School slow dance.  It's a revolution for all ages!!!"
1097,5,"I've listed & quickly sold this CD several times over the years, but unlike  99% of the music I sell, I keep a copy for myself. I no longer analyze why this \\""story\\"" soothes me: as I drift off it turns into a dream. How cool is that!"
1098,5,"Usually, concept albums either focus too much on the music and not enough on the story, or the other way around.  Iced Earth has crafted the perfect marriage of story and music, exceeding nearly everything preceding it in the genre.  For those who couldn't piece it together, the story is this:    Humankind is a scientifically-advanced, but morally-underdeveloped race bent on dominance and 'unlimited power'.  In their arrogance and desire for power, they invade the planet Earth, home of the Setians, a peaceful and spiritually advanced race, exterminating all but 10,000 of the Setians.  The Setians select thirteen of the survivors to inherit the spirits and knowledge of their High Council, and concoct the perfect revenge: over the next 10,000 years, they will cloud the memories of humankind (so that they will think of Earth as THEIR homeworld), creating deceptive and divisive religions, and finally, when humanity has turned against itself, revealing the Setian messiah, Set Abominae (which is where Part II will take up)."
1099,4,"I got both albums, and I loved the diversity of this album.  Both have a lot of fun and meaningful songs, and I appreciate the freshness of his music."
1100,5,As per usual the Dubbies turn out a great album.  I loved the traditional roots of this cd with the Dubbies take on them.  My favorites are Foggy Dew and Tell Me Ma.
1101,5,Neil's  great  live  album  no one  knows  about.  Its  out  there  in  my  record  box.  I  hope  its  never  done  in  Sound  robbing  CD. It  will  be  my  reason  for  getting  the  new  turntable  wired  up  into  the  Wharfdales.
1102,5,"In the two decades following the glory days of The Temptations/Four Tops/Supremes, etc., Motown started becoming a \\""dead\\"" label with very few notable artists recording for it. Some (notably Desiree Coleman) were very talented but disappeared way too quickly, while others like Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder had their best times behind them. When Boyz II Men emerged in 1991, they almost instantly became one of the most commercially successful groups ever, and not without good reason. \\""End Of The Road\\"", \\""Please Don't Go\\"", and \\""It's So Hard To Say Goodbye To Yesterday\\"" were the first in a long line of signature ballads featuring some of the most glorious harmonizing since the days of the other names mentioned here. Unfortunately, for all of this greatness, they couldn't singlehandedly spawn the broad resurgence that Motown had hoped for, and throughout the 1990s, they pretty much carried the label."
1103,4,"In some ways this is the birth of ABBA.<br />This album features the first track to have<br />all future members of ABBA on it and this is the very first album to have all the music written by Bj&ouml;rn and Benny. Bj&ouml;rn and Benny wrote the music to all of the songs and some of the lyrics. The whole album is sung in Swedish . Bj&ouml;rn doing most of the lead vocals, with Benny providing some backing vocals. Benny actually sings lead on one of the songs here-\\""Kara Gamla Sol\\"", but's it's hard to tell it's Benny. The original album featured eleven songs. The title translates into Happiness. This album was released in the fall of 1970 on Polar Records. As a whole, this album features some of Bj&ouml;rn's best work.<br /><br />Acoustic and Electric Guitar feature more prominently here than they would on ABBA records. The electric guitar ,in particular dominates on \\""Kalles Visa\\"" and \\""Nagonting Ar Pa Vag\\"".This album is a bit more serious in tone than some of the later B&B songs and early ABBA songs that would follow in the early and mid-Seventies. None of the songs here (even in translation) have a bubble gum lyrics or sound.<br /><br />\\""Hej Gamle Man\\"" (Hello Old Man) was released as the single from this album and proved to be successful, though the album was not overly successful. \\""Hej Gamle Man\\"" features Agnetha and Frida on backing vocals. It was the first song to feature all four members of ABBA. \\""Hej Gamle Man\\"" actually shows up on the ABBA box set -THANK YOU FOR YOU THE MUSIC.<br /><br />My favorite song on this album is the great acoustic guitar workout \\""Liselotte \\"" (it features lyrics by Agnetha and Bj&ouml;rn). I also love the anthemic \\""Ge Oss En Chans\\""(Give Us A Chance) . \\""Ge Oss En Chans \\""has some soulful singing and some great organ. A nice little touch can be found at the beginning of \\""Lilla Du, Lilla Van' which starts with Benny's piano sneaking in at a low volume.<br /><br />The stark brown cover is telling. It's clear that their is seriousness of purpose and intent in these two young man. Benny's (age 23) trademark beard puts in it's first appearence on a album cover (Benny (never had a beard on the Hep Stars album covers). Bj&ouml;rn (then age 25) looks a little smug but the trademark smile is there. The Swedish flag on the Guitar seems to say ,\\""We represent Sweden to the world!.

1104,5,"Occasionally ethereal but always musically coherent, with a lead singer   whose voice is full and lush but not so perfect it deadens you.  The tunes   are catchy and beautiful and the orchestration is very, very smart. But   don't start thinking you know something: some of the tracks are not like   the others.  This band can go strange all of a sudden -- for example with   an oddly successful song called \\""Dixie it Up\\"" for example. One of their   more typical pieces, \\""Toxic Shellfish in the Sun\\"" (Track 10) is worth the  price of the whole CD. But you really should buy the whole album, it's a  real treat."
1105,3,"Let's begin by acknowledging that Marvin Gaye was one of THE most important singing artists/stylists of the 1960s/70s and early 1980s. From 1962 to the time of his tragic death in April 1984 he had 60 R&B singles hits, most of which also scored on the Billboard Pop Hot 100 for Motown's Tamla subsidiary.<br /><br />Following his death, three more would make the R&B charts, including My Last Chance, released in 1990 on Motown. He was also inducted into the R&R Hall of Fame in 1987, and in 1996 was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.<br /><br />So, in putting together a 22-selection CD under the title \\""The Very Best Of\\"" the producers certainly had a wealth of material to choose from among his hit records. So what do they do? Include six tracks [4, 7, 11, 14, 20, and 22] that were not hits or even the B-sides of hits, and one [track 16] which was the flip of a hit - 1960's Keep On Lovin' Me Honey with Tammi Terrell [# 11 R&B/# 24 pop]. Which they do NOT include, by the way. Nor do they provide liner notes or discography of the contents.<br /><br />Here's a man with a background that could fill several books and they can't find someone to give us a few pages of information. For example, it might have been of interest to some to know that, on both Good Lovin' Ain't Easy To Come By and The Onion Song the female vocalist was actually Valerie Simpson, as Tammi was too ill at the time to complete the sessions [although she is credited on the records]. That also applied to the late 1969 hit What You Gave Me, also not included here.<br /><br />I like Marvin Gaye's music as much as the next person, but some people are obviously way too easy to please. Companies like Motown, MCA, BMG, etc., have to learn that the buying public demands a bigger bang for their buck these days, especially when something is hailed as \\""The Very Best Of\\"" or \\""The Greatest Hits Of.\\""<br /><br />Quality outfits like Ace Records of London, Rhino, Var&egrave;se-Sarabande, Eric, and Bear of Germany know this and go out of their way to provide us with detail-filled liner notes and, for the most part, the singles that made these people stars in the first place.this and go out of their way to provide us with detail-filled liner notes and, for the most part, the singles that made these people stars in the first place."
1106,5,"I'm a big Dean Martin fan and this album didn't disappoint me. For the most part, I was pleasantly surprised by the duet partners. It's clear they all admired Dean and his music.I also loved the arrangements. Dean's vocals blended in beautifully, with the production making it sound like he was present in the studio.    Just about every cut hit the mark. My favorite cuts were Who's Got The Action?, You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You, and A'int That A Kick In The Head. I have the CD with both versions of Everybody Loves Somebody. I enjoyed the Charles Aznavour version better.    Great album! Dean's music is timeless."
1107,3,"In the beginning of some of the performances, in the movie itself, one views Leopold Stokowski in a kind of sillhouette, almost mysteriously and mistically beginning each new composition.  Unfortunately this DVD has the same effect.  It is more a sillhouette than an actual true representation of what was recorded.  Some of the mixing problem may stem from stereo \\""effects\\"" that coincided with image movement, and that got lost in the monaural sound version.  But the general sound quality is pretty awful.  During the Toccata and Fugue, the sound seems to drop almost off the bottom of the audible chart - something that doesn't bother us as much when viewing the movie, but which is awful as sound.  The same over-filtered sensation comes through time and time again - note the opening of the Sugar Plum Fairy.  I was looking forward to hearing the Sorcerer's Apprentice, but it is a pale reminder of the magic LS could perform with the orchestral sound.  Only in the ending, the transition to Ave Maria and the Ave Maria itself do we get a hint of what the sound really was.  If I was at Disney I would scour the multiple recordings of these works, find the one that matches Stoki's version the best, and include that instead.  For the Toccata and Mussorgaky/Schubert, use the Kostal or re-record.  But please, get rid of this travesty of sound.  (I'd even like to see the spoken excerpts in the movie removed, since they date the movie almost more than the sound.)    In Fantasia 2000 you have the opposite problem - decent sound but drab performances."
1108,5,"Kudos to Cornel West, BMWMB and most of all to the guests artists who gave of their bold talents to make this such a groundbreaking project.      Thanks for the love just when needed most."
1109,5,"While up late one night watching TBN they played 2 of Ray Boltz songs; \\""The Anchor Holds\\"" and \\""Sent By The Father\\"" and I have been hooked since!  I had to hear more and purchased both DVD's and the CD---still looking for the Christmas concert.  Ray's mission \\""to produce and perform music that allows listeners and audiences to see Jesus\\"" has been accomplished in me; I have a deeper love for the Lord after viewing this awesome \\""review\\"" of the Bible stories within it.  I've even started seeking out a church home.  If you want to be changed on the inside and need a push, you can start by listening to Ray Boltz music, especially \\""The Concert of A Lifetime\\"" it details so much of God's love for us.  You will be amazed at what you hear.  God Bless You Too!!!"
1110,4,"This is the album I cut my Eagles teeth on, and by force of habit I still think of it as the definitive Eagles album.  But it's also where they took a decidedly commercial turn, and on my first run through it in several years, I didn't find it nearly as enjoyable as some of their other work.    No question, though, that it has its moments.  The mellow rock of \\""Take It to the Limit\\"" and \\""Lyin' Eyes\\"" never gets stale no matter how many times I hear them on classic rock radio.  The beautiful \\""Hollywood Waltz\\"" (which, as a country waltz, will never make it onto the radio!) rounds out the trio of five-star songs found here.  Most of the other songs are not bad:  \\""Too Many Hands\\"" and \\""Visions\\"" are characteristic Eagles rockers.  The well-known title track is nearly as good, though the not-quite-disco beat dates it a bit too much.  The instrumental \\""Journey of the Sorcerer\\"" is a fitting last stand for original member Bernie Leadon, who took the last of the Eagles' country influence with him when he left.      Overall, it's just a slight step down from their two previous albums.  If you like the hits from here, you'll probably like at least some of the other songs as well."
1111,5,The more I listen to this CD the more I love it.  There's not a song I Dislike. What a beautiful voice.  I preordered it after viewing the You Tube videos.  Didn't want to wait.  After listening to it several times I am enjoying it even MORE!  Love the person Paul is and his beautiful God-given voice.  Much success to you Paul and you wonderful supportive wife.
1112,5,it took me a long time to find this cd. it is hard to find because its an old one. I had the cassette and learned most of the songs from it. I love all the songs on this cd. I think is one of the best from Bose. I definetely recommend having it to all the Bose fans. it is a combination of ethereal music and psicological lyrics. Beautiful.
1113,5,"We cannot say enough about this wonderful, anointed and appointed by God, CD!  All the songs are wonderful (my personal favorite is Operator).    We have been blessed to know Buffy and be best friends and brother and sister to Buffy since Christmas Day 1992.  She is a Spirit-filled teacher, evangelist and awesome worshipper/songstress.  Check out her ministry's website at [...] to find out when she is speaking and worshipping in your area.  Or sign her up.-Do I sound like a promotional agent? Well if I do, it is because she is such a blessing.    Can't wait to her her next album, which I hope includes some of my favorites like her version of \\""Yesterday, I cried my last tears, yesterday\\"". \\""I'd Rather Have Jesus\\"", and the song that I can't wait to see her perform via sign language as well, \\""Revelation Song\\"".    So what are you waiting on my friends, buy this CD and play it at home or in the car or buy one for both! (:    Rev. Joseph & Mrs. Serene S. Culp"
1114,5,"this is a great follow up to core.  stand outs are meatplow, big empty, vasoline and my favorite; interstate love song.  all of these are still in heavy rotation on the radio.  after song #11 ends DONT TURN OFF THE RADIO JUST YET!  keep it playing and another song starts playing, gracious melodies.  its more comical than serious.  the guy has a real cheesy sounding voice.  actually sounds like he is some sort of vegas lounge singer.  if you like this band get this, core and thank you (a greatest hits compilation) and thats about all you should need.  also check out velvet revolver if you like scott weiland him and slash put something together after STP broke up."
1115,5,"Few CD retrospectives offer material that so completely captures the mood of a time period.  This is such a CD.  Rivermont records has put together the definitive collection of one of the most recorded, but alas, most overlooked orchestras from the 1920's:  Sam Lanin.  Perhaps due to the wide variety of aliases this man chose to record under.      I can scarcely remember a contemporary radio program or review of the 1920's that even mentions this seminal orchestra leader.  Yet, should we manage to resurrect personalities from that time period, an objective musical historian would presume anyone alive during the '20's could quickly point to the Sam Lanin organization as a \\""first mention\\"" name in dance bands.    I highly recommend this CD."
1116,2,"Loved Dire Straits, I was very much looking forward to this album.  Hate it, it plods and there's a dearth of interesting guitar work.  The second-worse album in my entire collection!  Bad enough to have kept me from buying any current original album for two years.    If you're still interest in Mark Knopfler solo, try the Dire Strait/Mark Knopfler \\""Private Investigation\\"" - the second of the two discs is all Mark Knopfler, and a lot more interesting than this dud, although I'm still not a fan.  Better yet is the first disc - classic Dire Straits!"
1117,4,"If you are looking for real gospel without all the showmanship, this is the cd for you. She doesn't perform, she sings!! The title song will really minister to you, remind you of all God has done for you and provoke you to share your testimony."
1118,5,"Loreena McKennitt is one of my all time favorite recording artists...and she truly deserves the title of artist...she writes, arranges and performs her own music in her own studio, and her voice is gorgeous, her music lush, exotic, rich in complexity and arrangement, and just a delight for the soul.  It is wonderful to have her in good tune, sharing her melodic and stirring \\""musings\\"" not in an ancient way at all, but in a modern, satisfying and imaginitive manner that communicates the deepest aspects of her talents directly to our own hearts!"
1119,5,"As many of you know Les Elgart was the person behind the successful \\""Bandstand Boogie\\"" for \\""American Bandstand\\"". His band showed off their talents in this two-fer CD set from albums released in 1960. Good material and sounds so clear today on compact disc. I can not get enough of the Mar-Cha-Cha in the Designs for Dancing portion of the C.D. Great rhythm for some of Elgart's new fans!!"
1120,5,"In today's classical music world, most performances are uniform - that is to say dull and uneventful. Some orchestras are better then others, but mostly what's heard on record and the concert halls these days is uninspired mush.  Gutless interpretations are combined with timid playing resulting in bland music making.      If you agree, get this recording, you'll be astounded!  Call Toscanini's Beethoven fast, Italianate, linear or whatever you wish; He played Beethoven like Beethoven seized fate, \\""By the throat!\\""    The timing of this recording is essential to understanding its intensity.  Recorded only weeks after Germany's invasion of Poland a despondent Maestro poured his desperate angst into this greatest of symphonies.      Toscanini pushes the orchestra so hard in places (the first movement has to be the fastest on record) that the musicians seem in danger of smashing their instruments into pieces.  The great wonder is that the shear beauty of the work still shines through at every turn.  Toscanini leaves the audience (this is recorded at Carnegie Hall)  in this darkest of hours with a message that there is still some hope."
1121,5,"Take this from someone who tags, and hopes to one day DJ/Produce for some great MC's:    -BE WARNED: This is pure Hip-Hop.  One of those albums that makes commercial & radio-hiphop lovers frown and condescendingly say,\\"" WHAT ARE YOU LISTENING TO?\\""    -The lyricists on this outing define Jazzy's impeccable taste for HipHop as musical/emotional expression.  It's just good music.  Expect nothing but 'Raw & Beautiful' from this one (and definitely listen to the above samples).    -How's the production?  This can be answered with some word association:  Pete Rock, DJ Muggs, DJ Premier, J Dilla, Madlib, Buck Shot, 9th Wonder, Magnif, ?uestlove - starting to get the picture?  If not, take a listen to their work too (if you haven't already - hahaha).    Don't file this under CRUNK, SWISHA, CLUB, POP, UNDERGROUND, ART-HOP, TRIP-HOP (or whatever else the many \\""expert-opinion\\"" music mags are buzzin'these days).    Keep reppin' the \\""four-elements\\"" (DJing, MCing, Tagging & Breaking).    Peace,  TRINO"
1122,3,"OK. First off, Id like to say that I was never a big fan of the Beasties. I liked their hits, sabatage, sure shot, no sleep till Brooklyn, girls, etc, but I never bought any of their cds. I was in a record store about 5 days ago when i heard someone mention that the new beasties cd would be all instrumentals. I asked what that would sound like and he said instrumental chill funk music. So I downloaded it, and I really like it. (Dont worry, I went out and bought it too). I wont say love, but I do really like it. It sounds good, and is produced well. Its cool for background music, or if you just wanna chill out. It might get a little boring but I would say that it is an overall good cd. Its something new and different out right now and I think thats great. Give it a listen, see for yourself."
1123,3,"I have highly praised Maria Muldaur's recent trilogy of covers of classic women blues singers. (see all my reviews)  I stated in those reviews that she had paid (and more than paid) her dues to be in the company of Memphis Minnie, Bessie Smith and Sippy Wallace. I am also a devoted Bob Dylan fan from way back. Nevertheless I was disappointed in this album. Partly I think that it was overproduced. But I also believe part of the problem is that while Dylan has done many love songs in different formats and in different moods from rage to sentiment I do not believe that overall this is his strongest kind of song. That seems to be reflected here. Take one example- Buckets of Rain- so-so for Maria. The definitive cover for me is Dave Van Ronk's bitter sweet version. If you compare the two covers you will see what I mean. But getting back to the meat of my conflict if you listen to Maria's cover of Sippy Wallace's-Don't Advertise Your Man you then know what blues heaven is. There she is right at home."
1124,3,"Wow. It seems as if people just are not digging on the new Tiger Army record.  Well, if you're looking for Tiger Army circa \\""Power of Moonlite\\"" then you will most ceratinly be dissapointed by \\""Music From Regions Beyond\\"". Indeed there is very little here that could be classified as psychobilly. Hell man, there is even a song here that sounds like it could've appeared on a mid-eighties Cure song! (And by that song I of course mean the excellent \\""As the Cold Rain Falls\\""). So if you enter this record expecting another \\""Incorpereal\\"", well, you better just save your cash.  \\""Music From Regions Beyond\\"" is a dissapointment in the fact that it is the first Tiger Army not to build on it's predesscor. \\""Music\\"" is not as good as the amazing \\""Ghost Tigers Rise\\"" as it doesn't feature any songs as strong as \\""Wander Alone\\"" or \\""Rose of the Devil's Garden\\"" or \\""Through the Darkness\\"" or \\""The Long Road\\"" or \\""Calling\\"" or, well, you get the point. In fact, the record has some serious pacing problems(you could really listen to this record on a random shuffle and get the same vibe as you do with the chosen final running order) and the production of Jerry Finn(known for his work with groups like Alkaline Trio, Blink 182 and Tiger Army buddies AFI) drains a lot of Tiger Army's energy that was so exuberant and obvious on their three previous records. This is Tiger Army going for the big time.  But \\""Music From Regions Beyond\\"" is not a bad record. There is not a bad song on the record and Nick 13 brings out melodic hooks throughout. The lyrically bent remains the same and are as strong as they have been on the previous Tiger Army records.  So really \\""Music From Regions Beyond\\"" is Tiger Army's attempt to reach for that next ring on the musical platform(every group deserves a free pass for one of those. ONE!) and people new to Tiger Army are sure to love this record. Fans of Tiger Army are sure to think it's pretty good. So while this record is not enough to make you write Tiger Army off(again, everygroup deserves one good not great album), it's not strong enough to be considered another classic in their ouevre."
1125,4,"With R&B these days, it seems like many people would rather listen to an artist that doesn't have as much talent today, as they did years. That is why acts like the overexposed and disgraced Paris Hilton, and alcoholic Lindsay Lohan try to dominate the industry altogether. However, acts from the past aren't really being reintroduced today as much as I think they should. For Angela Winbush, who hasn't made anything new in almost 15 years, has often been overshadowed. Even then, she was also overlooked in favor of soul divas Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey. Yet, with all the great beats Angela recorded, she still is missed, and this hits record shows how good a R&B icon she is.<br /><br />The 2001 Angela Winbush Ultimate Collection, is a single disc retrospective of her era through the 80's and 90's, and on not just her solo achievements, but her days when she was a part of the duo Rene & Angela. The songs here have all been remastered well, and sound much better than they previously were released. The collection includes great tracks that were hip hop influenced like I'll Be Good and It's The Real Thing, to the soulful and sensual Treat U Rite from her self-titled last record, 1993's Angela Winbush, and her rendidtion of Marvin Gaye's Inner City Blues. The collection also includes her works with her ex-husband Ronald Isley from the Isley Brothers including Floatin' On Your Love, and other great songs from her era including You Don't Have To Cry.<br /><br />All in all, it is still very sad Angela Winbush hasn't made anything new in several years and she is definitely missed. I just think a lot of great acts today, could learn a whole lot from a diva like her. This Ultimate Collection is a great buy for die hard fans, and works nicely as a reintroduction to Angela's career that does treat her and others right. I absolutely recommend this album.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: B 1/2+<br /><br />Price: B+<br /><br />Remastering: B+<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+"
1126,2,"I have been a Dream Theater fan since Images and Words. I have bought every CD and DVD, saw them live (great live band) and even bought James Labrie's solo stuff. However, I am ready to tap out on this band.  Since Train of Thought (not a bad effort, just very mediocre after Scenes and Six Degrees), Dream Theater's studio efforts have just been plain weak.  Octavarium was a cd that was dull including the title song's twenty plus minutes of epic meandering to nowhere.  I ended up selling it back to my local used CD store.  So I was hesitant about buying Systematic Chaos, but after checking out the fans' sites and reading the early positive reviews on this new CD, I took the plunge. After the last two days of listening to Systematic Chaos, I finally pinned down what is missing from the band's last three studio efforts including Chaos....the songs lack soul and heft compared to their earlier efforts.  Compare this CD's songs to earlier efforts such as \\""Voices\\"", \\""Learning to Live\\"", \\""Lines in the Sand\\"",  \\""A Change of Seasons\\"", \\""Hollow Years\\"" etc. and you can tell this band's latest efforts have hit the creative and musical wall.  The song structures are tiresome, the lyrics are now getting downright embarrassing and the \\""Flight of the Bumblebee\\"" music noodling and time changes in most of these songs now have no purpose, direction and cohesion.  Memo to the band: we know you can play music that most bands in the world can't touch, but sometimes tight, simple song structures with better lyrical content go a long way especially after 15 years of torching your instruments with your musical ability song in and song out.   <br /> <br />Dream Theater's music structure and musical bridges that lead to nowhere have gotten old and mechanical over time especially when it adds nothing to the direction of the song and the lyrics can't carry a tune. I don't know, maybe my tastes for this type of musical effort is waning. However, I truly believe after many years of creating CD after CD, playing world tour after world tour, and the many side projects the band's members have done on their own time, all of their hard work has finally caught up with the band.  Dream Theater's creative tank is empty.  Many great bands have recovered after time off from the business (U2 after the dreadful Zooropa era), but some bands never recover.  It is time for this band to take an extended break and recharge their creative juices.  <br /> <br />In the IPod era where consumers can pick and choose songs to download without shelling out cash for the entire album, Dream Theater cannot afford to put only one or two good efforts on a CD.  From now on, I will only download what I think is worthwhile from this band. For Systematic Chaos, I would have downloaded \\""Forsaken\\"" (a marginal call), \\""Prophets of War\\"" and \\""The Ministry of Lost Souls\\"".  I had the highest hopes for \\""In the Presence of Enemies\\"", but frankly the song falls flat at the end. You are looking for soaring, moving music to tie the whole effort together and you get a clanking non-emotive ending instead.  \\""Constant Motion\\"" and \\""The Dark Eternal Night\\"" are absolutely worthless gumbo of musical goo wrapped in Metallica and Slipknot flavors and those songs would have never made it to any of the band's earlier efforts before 2002.  \\""Repentance\\"" has promise, but after John's decent solo, the song limps to the end with the musical melody being repeated over and over while voices talk and talk the last two minutes of the song leaving the listener frustrated.  To me, at this point, the golden era of the band's studio efforts ended with the release of Six Degrees...."
1127,5,"<br />\\""One Day I Walk\\"" was the first BC song I ever heard. <br />The Tom Rush verison it was though. I HAD to find out <br />about the writer of the song - incredible! <br /> <br />Back in the mid-1970's, it wasn't easy finding alot of <br />BC music until \\""DANCING IN THE DRAGON'S JAWS\\"". I worte <br />to stores in Canada and had friends looking in Japan for <br />ANYTHING they could find from him. Slowly, the USA discovered <br />and stocked BC records and tapes. This album was one of the first <br />3 or 4 I found. Touching, mellow, heartfelt, great playing, great  <br />words, in the best of the singer/song writer tradition! <br /> <br />Bruce showed us all here that there was alot more to come from him! <br />If you like early BC, this is his first - a great one to get."
1128,5,"Michael Buble' at his best.  A must have CD for all Buble' fans, or anyone who loves the standards!"
1129,5,"What can be said that hasn't been said already?? This is another great collection of songs from a superb singer/songwriter/guitarist that deserves a wider audience..If you haven't heard of Richard Thompson,then do yourself a favor and get this cd and then get Mock Tudor,Old Kit Bag,too.Also,see him live and see some amazing guitar playing! What are you waiting for???"
1130,5,Live is one of the best band out there! Great music that you can hear anywhere and anytime....
1131,5,"This CD set is well worth the money. Actually, it's priced very reasonable. There are alot of new songs. All 4 CD's are excellant. <br />Again, Vince Gill delivers !!"
1132,5,"If you ever do a search, you'll find that there are literally dozens of different sub-categories of Metal. Death, Black, Viking, Folk, Melodic, Symphonic and Heavy, just to name a few. And now TURISAS have introduced a whole new one: BATTLE METAL! <br /> <br />So what is Battle Metal? It's music that gets you pumped up for Medieval Armageddon, that's what it is! I'm quite sure that if you play this CD while watching \\""300\\"" you'll be able to rip doors off hinges and bench-press your SUV before the movie ends. It's nearly impossible to listen to this and not feel this ancient brutality flow into your veins.  <br /> <br />For me, the chaos starts with \\""As Torches Rise\\"" bringing to mind the beginnings of one wild riot, complete with torches, pikes and pitchforks. <br />The momentum doesn't die down with \\""Battle Metal\\"", the title track and one of this album's many masterpieces. Great shouting! <br />\\""The Messenger\\"" pays homage to the oft-forgotten pawn in battle, who's only enemy is Time.  <br />\\""Sahti Waari\\"" sounds a bit more Folk Metal than Battle Metal, but it's still a great piece, one of my favorites, in fact. <br />\\""Midnight Sunrise\\"" has two versions on this album. The original one is the best. The live version is not so good because the song is done minus the choir parts, which were very good. The volume on the live version sounds really muted, too. <br />My favorite drinking song in Metal is \\""Happy Little Boozer\\"" by Korpiklaani, but \\""One More\\"" gets my vote for second best. Raise your pints up high for your fallen comrades! <br />Finally, \\""The Heart of Turisas\\"", \\""The Land of Hope and Glory\\"" and \\""Katuman Kaiku\\"" are also really great. <br /> <br />CD booklets often don't warrant comment, but when you see the pictures of the band members, you'll see that they mean business! And the two-page spread in the middle would make a great poster! <br /> <br />For sheer atmospheric music, it doesn't get much better than this!"
1133,5,"I've always liked Paul Simon, but I just gained new respect for the compositions on this album... I'm a harmonica player, and was casually trying to play along with the songs-- but man, are these tunes complex! They sound like simple folk ditties, but there are all kinds of key modulations that sneak up on you (it's very hard to modulate with diatonic harmonicas--you need a different harp for each key). This fancy stuff is so understated that you don't even notice it though; the melodies all have an intimate, honest feeling. Amazing stuff."
1134,5,"When I saw this film in theaters, I knew I had to have the soundtrack, well that was back in 1999 and I just NOW go around to buying it!"
1135,5,"This is Mehdi's best CD by far....I loved it!  His earlier works are good but, to my ears, he spoiled many fine compositions with his heavy handed use of programmed percussion.  Not so in Instrumental Paradise, where electronic drumbeats no longer dominate Mehdi's music.  Thank you Mehdi for creating this masterpiece of New Age Jazz!"
1136,5,"Jerry will always be the legend and the Killer. He is truly the last man standing. <br />I really enjoyed audio CD that comes in this package. Songs are live cuts from recent performances.  Jerry's version of Lucille is just great. I have always enjoyed his take on this song and have been blasting this  recent version in my car and at home.  <br />  <br />About DVD...I must admit that my favorite Jerry was when he was in his 40s and 50s. <br />He had the blues, the country and the rocknroll. He had the heartache to portray it in his songs and he still had the fire to give it some hell on the piano. This DVD is for the fans - people who love JLL, who follow him, who respect him and who admire him. I think it was a great effort to prove the point of the Last Man Standing, but at the same time when I finished watching this DVD i had a bit of a nostalgic feeling not willing to admit that the years are going by..."
1137,4,"this was one of new englands best albums, aside from explorer suite witch was also very solid, despite getting airplay they never really got reconized, but they were one of the best out there that the critics never discovered... gene simmons from kiss gave them their start and got there albums on a record label, he also helps with some of there songs youll find his name on a couple of there albums... it is worth listening to again and again...."
1138,5,"When I first discovered this CD was for sale, I cried.  When I first listened to it-not having any idea what they'd put on here from the show, the most beautiful music started up and then \\""Vincent\\"" started reading the poetry that he read to Catherine and that made me fall in love with his character -eventually, well, the tears just quietly flowed from my eyes, surprised me!  I wasnt aware of crying till the tears flowed from the pure beauty of the sounds from this CD.  All these years later, I still treasure and love this CD above all my others, it gives you a sense of peace too and the poems bring understanding of true love.  I highly recommend it!!  (dont let the flowery sentimental review deter you-I really believe most who love beautiful music will love this)."
1139,2,"<br />Well, friends, it appears what we have--in the many reviews found for other Barrowman releases--is some folks unwilling/unable to \\""tell it like it is.\\""  In other words, we've got numerous comments by members of \\""The Friends of John Barrowman Society.\\""  The following, however, is my attempt to \\""t.i.l.i.i.\\"" <br />  <br />Much of his work on this and other CDs consists of romantic Broadway tunes and time-tested love ballads, music for which his voice, to me, is too high-pitched (I'm sure he would be great in Broadway and film musicals.......as someone other than the top banana).  Yes, he can \\""carry a tune,\\"" and he's easy to look at, well, handsome.  Truth be told, never having previously heard, or heard of, John B., I bought this release pretty much on the basis of his cover \\""pic.\\""  Admittedly, now, that was a mistake. <br />  <br />I think it's great that he can be open about whom he is, and be comfortable with it, but speaking of things musical I believe he doesn't have the \\""vocal goods\\"" to play the usual romantic lead.  His best option would be to stick with those many songs more suitable to his higher-pitched voice.  Continued good fortune in the future, John. <br /> <br />****"
1140,5,This CD is excellent.  No Mario Lanza collection would be complete without it.
1141,5,Chris should have won Idol but not winning isn't stopping him. <br /> <br />This CD was very well done and Chris is going to be right up there with Creed and Nickelback
1142,3,"This is not a review but a heads up for Mary Lorson fans.  I bought this cd because I am quite fond of Mary's singing.  Unfortunately, on this cd she sings on only one song."
1143,4,"This long-overdue and much-anticipated CD reissue of two of Isaac Hayes' albums from the late-'70s is much welcome indeed. Granted, some of the uptempo disco tracks sound dated, trite and overproduced but the gorgeous slow-burn ballads are vintage Isaac Hayes on all counts. Despite changing trends, Isaac Hayes' music remained fresh and relevant and the two LPs reissued on this CD are (mostly) very fine and soulful."
1144,5,"I received this CD on April 4th and I haven't had it out of my CD player yet. There really isn't a bad song in the bunch.<br /><br />I love Someone to Love, '92 Subaru, Yolanda Hayes, This Better Be Good, Michael and Heather at the Baggage Claim, I-95, and New Routine. Planet of Weed and Hotel Majestic, while good, aren't my favorites.<br /><br />As usual, the lyrics are clever and funny and there are plenty of contagious hooks. This album, like Welcome Interstate Managers, is beautifully produced. It lacks the raw feeling of their debut and sophmore efforts, but I personally prefer the more polished sound.<br /><br />Lots of nice guitar work and, of course, there's plenty FOW signature vocal harmonies. This CD is very nostalgic - lots of 60's and 70's influences throughout.<br /><br />I highly recommend this CD. Buy it."
1145,5,"Perhaps not the ultimate in style, but drop dead stunning sound. Kudos to the recording eng. at BIS! This series far makes up for a non Karajan approach with super detailed sound. This is SACD demo quality!"
1146,5,"Don't be afraid to jump on this one! Unlike previous \\""symphonic\\"" releases, this album stands up on it's own, and is an outstanding CD. This collection is well played and wonderfully arranged. I've listened to it almost everyday since buying it three weeks ago. A fresh look at some well-worn classic Genesis material."
1147,5,I have sunday morning coffee on audio cassette from way back in 1991 and i still play at parties today its great for partys its relaxing but not sleepy or obnocious vey entertaining.
1148,5,"I bought this for \\""music appreciation\\"" education for my 6 yr. old.  I thought it would be challenging to get him, as well as my 2 1/2 and 1 1/2 yr. olds, to let me play it in the car.  I also thought it would bore and/or irritate my husband -- so I was nervous a bit.  Well, I was completely wrong.  We all \\""love\\"" it.  <br /> <br />It is high quality and pleasant to the ears.  We play it whenever we are in the car.  The narratives in \\""Peter and the Wolf\\"" and \\""Carnival of the Animals\\"" are very engaging and hold their attention.  At home, my 6 yr. old sits at the dinner table and recites the entire narrative (along with the appropriate tune representing the characters) of Peter and the Wolf -- complete with Bernstein's accent!  Great memory/recitation exercise and he does it voluntarily.  My two year old asks for it EVERY TIME we're in the car and many times my 1 1/2 yr. old is fussy until we turn it on, then she's as content as can be.   <br /> <br />All the kids have picked out characters to \\""be\\"" in Peter and the Wolf and have assigned them to Mom and Dad.  It's a lot of fun.  My 2 yr. old always calls out when the cat comes along, \\""That's me!!\\"" and my 1 1/2 yr. old always says, \\""Correct!\\"" just before Bernstein does. The littlest to the oldest listen intently and engage with the narrator. <br /> <br />The last piece is my personal favorite, as it introduces each instrument in the orchestra and how it all fits together, and the music is beautiful (the kids like the music too, but prefer \\""Peter...\\"").  My 6 yr. old has learned a lot from the last piece without realizing it; when I explain instruments of music we hear elsewhere, he calmly informs me, \\""I know that, Mom.\\""    <br /> <br />This fascination with the CD has lasted a long time; we did not just start listening to it last week.  I think that reflects on how enjoyable it is for the whole family.  My husband has told me repeatedly how glad he is we bought this.  It is also a good buy here on Amazon -- I paid severaldollars more for it.   <br />"
1149,1,"Lloyd trys his best to channel Michael Jackson or Usher and anyone else he can think of,but His vocal range is limited. the Musical Production&Songwriting also leaves alot to be desired. familiar Samples.this album is just basically the same formula as his debut album."
1150,5,"Track List <br />1. Streets on Beats <br />2. Call It What You Want <br />3. El Jugador <br />4. Just a Friend to Me <br />5. Lowlife <br />6. West Coast, Gulf Coast, East Coast <br />7. Madman <br />8. Million Dollar Stars <br />9. Two Shotgun Weddings <br />10. A Perfect Man (Remix) <br />11. Breezy <br />12. No Second Chances"
1151,3,"There is some rewards on this CD musically, if you can get past this man's voice. He has incredible fortitude to actually sing and release the results for posterity. His voice is a cracked whine that must pain him to emote. I love the guy though, and it is a guilty pleasure to give it a spin when no one else is around (you won't win friends forcing this one on unsuspecting guests)."
1152,2,"I purchased this CD because I fell in love with Taylor Hick's soulful voice.  I was disappointed with the song choices and predictable arrangements. I hope Taylor had no say in the selections because that would lead me to believe that perhaps his next CD would be better.  I'm not sure if Taylor's personal song genre is soul or R&B but that's what I fell in love with on American Idol and his CD prior to A.I.  Listening to him do anything but, I guess I'd have to get used to."
1153,5,I like this release one of the best albums of 2006.<br />Lot of great songs and the bonus tracks are awesome !<br />Can't wait to hear the next 2 albums when they come out.
1154,5,"This is a thematic album of songs about life as war and survival..with London's WW 2 bombings heard in the background as the husband declines the 2nd cup of tea, women of leisure seeking a living, the exploits of an aggressive colonial power heard in Queen & Country, the certitude of skating away on life's thin ice, Living in society is alas living in the jungle, and you balance the world on the tip of your nose...Coming after Passion's Play, these songs are well constructed mini pieces.<br /><br />The sound of these remasters are great, and now with the inclusion of Rainbow Blues, classical instrumentals,alternative versions this becomes a wonderful CD that stands up to the test of time..I saw this \\""War Child\\"" tour at Madison Square Garden and vividly remember Ian Anderson parading around the dark lights as the bombs were exploding around him ushering in a very good time for music."
1155,5,"I bought this cd as an alternative to the \\""same old, same old\\"" Christmas music you hear on the radio.  And, being of Irish descent, I wanted something different.  This is a great cd and I would highly recommend it to anyone thinking of buying it.  You won't be disappointed and it will become one of your favorites!"
1156,5,"The new Nonesuch remasters of the Pat Metheny catalog have a significant, if not incredibly different, sound improvement over the original Geffen CDs. Simply stated, the sound is much \\""brighter\\"" and clearer, and  depending on the tracks, instruments have a better balance, and in some cases stand out better in the mix than the original. Since most of these albums were originaly recorded with exceptional skill in the age of digital audio technology (mid 1980's to present), the truth is that the original CDs can stand out just as good in terms of sound quality. This is not like some remasters of 60s, and 70s albums where the sound difference is huge. With the exception of Song X(X), the remasters feature no pluses. It would have been nice to have some extra tracks, new or restored artwork, PMG in the studio photos, essays or something. So if you are not a PatMetheniac fan and have the original CDs, stick with them. If you have never had the pleasure of having these great works of art, don't wait any longer and get them. This is some of the greatest music ever recorded. Now, if the original ECM releases were remastered..."
1157,5,"I love this album! I first heard \\""Magnify\\"" 3 years on MSN radio. And I only just got the album a couple weeks ago. It certainly is not the sort of album with only one great song, and the rest leaving you disappointed. It's so refreshing to listen to, and you just can't get the words and tunes out of your head. <br />\\""Magnify\\"" struck me first because I loved the way he modulated from verse to chorus. \\""Taboo\\"", \\""Amplified\\"" have wonderful choruses that you can sing forever. \\""American Idle\\"" has a lovely tune to the verses. And the hymn \\""I love to tell the story\\"" is a perfect finish.  <br />So, \\""Hey, kids get amplified, cos you just can't hide when it burns inside. I say, 'Hey!'...\\"" Amazing album."
1158,5,NEVA BE ANOTHER LIKE IT CLASSIC
1159,5,"High water mark in Braxtonia one of his classics, showcases some of Braxton's major big band compositions complex, ambitious and swinging like crazy.  Man can write ! Also a straight orchestral march and some more abstract pieces, Line up reads like a who's who of 70's contemporary jazz all great names. If there 's only one Braxton you have room for this is a good one as any. This recording and all the quartet/duos and orchestra music from this period have all been reissued now on the Mosaic box set a great collection."
1160,3,"like the Charles Mingus Complete Atlantic Recordings, WHY CHANGE THE ORDER OF THE SONGS. these were albums that fit together. what idiot run these companies? do they just put the stuff on random play for the order? i would love to have these because some of these recordings are hard to find. His label, but some of his stuff is hard to find. doesn't make sense, does it?"
1161,1,"Thank Philip Schultz.  I was hoping someone else noticed the defects.  VERY IRRITATING as the Columbia versions, while sounding muddier, do not have these problems.<br /><br />\\""Acquiring the Taste\\"" remaster also has problems.  \\""The House\\"" 5:21 and 5:23.  \\""Moon is Down\\"" 2:40 and \\""Plain Truth\\"" 3:48 and 4:31.<br /><br />REPUK must fix this and offer exchanges!!  These albums are classics (5 stars normally)."
1162,3,"There are a few really great songs on here, but it's not the best work they've done."
1163,4,"Massimo Ranieri is well-known in Italy for his fresh renderings of classic canzone napoletane (Neapolitan songs). On \\""Oggi e Dimane\\"" (Today and Tomorrow) he serves up some of his most radical, surprising and beautiful reinterpretations of well-known, and some less familiar, songs from the Neapolitan tradition. The songs are drawn from a century's worth of material, from the late 1800s to the 1950s (Renato Carasone's \\""Petrol Caravan\\"").In recent years, Neapolitan and other southern Italian musicians have broadened their muscial palettes to incorporate North African, sub-Saharan African, and Middle Eastern influences. Ranieri's no exception; several tracks here feature Arab and African musicians, in addition to Ranieri's excellent Italian sidemen. The superb griot singer Badara Seck appears on two tracks. One, \\""La Rundinella\\"" (Little Swallow) is the CD's highlight, featuring Seck's extraordinary vocal improvisations and accompaniment from the kora, a sort of African lute."
1164,5,"I have just seen Montserrat Caball&eacute;, after more than 50 years on stage, in a painfull charity recital on my hometown, M&aacute;laga (Spain). How cruel time is. Fortunately we have records like this one to keep alive in our ears and souls the rare beauty, sure technique and great artistry that was Caball&eacute;'s. We won't hear anything like it again. There are many others, but this one is as good a starting place as any to experience her magic. And beware, after it, you'll be spoiled forever."
1165,1,"Written by a non-ringer, who is not stuffing the ballot box...  Except for track 7, this album is a total waste of resources.  And track 7 is only mediocre.  This falls into the worst of the worst albums ever.  The only reason I am rating it 1 star is because I can't give it anything lower. <br />"
1166,5,"If you like romantic lyrics, with a beautiful melody, sang by a beautiful voice and played by a great live band, this is a CD for you. <br />The first song has a very nice pop/jazz groove with a sexy and intelligent lyric and the singing is great. The second is a romantic soft ballad that could please almost all kinds of tastes. The third song is called Feminine Instict and has a very feminine lyric. And finally that forth song is fresh with a world music kind of sound mix with pop. It's very pretty. Also the booklet with the lyrics has very tasteful and beautiful pictures. <br />This is a great value and a wonderful product. I definatelly recommend!"
1167,5,This cd is great.  No problems with cd or shipping.  It arrived fast. <br />Good quality
1168,5,"I bought this CD for \\""Somewhere Over The Rainbow/What A Wonderful World.\\"" The song is absolutely, incredibly great! But other songs on this album are growing on me as well. I would place IZ's rendition of \\""Somewhere over the Rainbow\\"" the best ever made and somewhat further elevated in its greatness by combining the song with \\""What a Wonderful Life.\\""  <br /> <br />This is a must-have for anyone's musical collection."
1169,5,"Phenomenal! Although I can't say I'm a Bowie fan, I feel this CD has the power to soothe and in trance the listener in a way I've not encountered in a long time. It moves your soul! It's a brilliant fusion of rock music with almost haunting vocals and harmonies. You can't help but \\""feel\\"" their music! You'll find the tunes and choruses attach themselves to your brain and not let go."
1170,5,"Cool Yule was so much fun to have this Holiday, it kept me upbeat and even listening to it over and over. <br /> <br />It's a hit for years to come. <br /> <br />Judy in CA"
1171,5,Good music for anyone to listen to at any age.  Will put a smile on your face.
1172,5,"What a great selection of music, wonderfully played.  St. Anne's Reel itself is one of those irresistable toe-tapping dances to which it is impossible to sit still.  It's now a staple of bluegrass music."
1173,4,The title track is fantastic as is Not Ready To Make nice but overall I preferred Wide Open Spaces and Top of the World
1174,4,"This second release is a bit more commercial than the self titled debut but it is still great. Memorable hooks, emotive lyrics, and just enough of a progressive vibe to keep things interesting. I don't usually listen to pop rock (I am more of a fan of the underground) but this band caught my ear. Their overall package is presented well and the musical vision is well executed. <br />Highly Recommended."
1175,5,"Even now, almost twenty-five years since its original release, TWILIGHT ZONE--THE MOVIE is understandably considered at best just an okay kind of film in comparison with the classic TV series that spawned it.  The fact that Vic Morrow and two Vietnamese child extras were needlessly killed only tainted the film that much more. <br /> <br />But there's little denying one of the film's numerous saving graces, namely one more great score composed by master film composer Jerry Goldsmith, whose genius is very evident in conjuring up the film's atmosphere of mystery, suspense, wonder, paranoia, and psychological horror.  Much as he did for THE OMEN and STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE, the composer weaves numerous musical elements: oscillating, Herrmann-influenced strings for Segments 1 & 4; a congenial children's waltz/scherzo for Spielberg's segment with the kids and the old folk's home; and a combination of cartoon-like wackiness and Debussy-influenced tone painting for Segment 3.  And of course it wouldn't be the Twilight Zone without Marius Constant's familiar theme music and Rod Serling's introductory narration, would it? <br /> <br />If the film had been made without incident, it would almost certainly have been a big box office hit in 1983, instead of the modest hit that it actually was; and Goldsmith's score would be as well-known as many of his others.  Still, the score does stand out, and it's well worth revisiting."
1176,4,"Give the guy a break! At least he was up front with his intentions before he just sprung \\""Alter Ego\\"" on us! He could have just released it without an explaination.  <br /> <br />The R&B side is some of Tyrese's best work. \\""One\\"", \\""Better to Know\\"", and \\""Morning After\\"" are my favorites, but I don't skip the others! This entire cd sets the mood for a romantic evening at home. It's kind of short, but you won't mind repeating it over ad over again. His voice mixed witht he soft texture of the tracks sets that mood right! TRUST!!! <br /> <br />Black Ty is a joke. He can't possibly be taken seriously as a rapper. This entire cd was full of big names and absoultely no bang.The song \\""Alter Ego\\"" was cute, but come on! I talk to myself all of the time and sometimes I sing too. Does that mean I should record an album?  <br /> <br />I gave the REAL cd (The R&B one) the review. Use the rap cd as a coaster or something. I got 2 cds for the price of one so I can't be disappointed because I like one whole cd all the way through and hate the other. Listen to the first cd and you'll feel like you got you money's worth!"
1177,4,For those of you that think this CD is crap...listen to Taylor Hicks first national release album. The sound is horrible. It sounds like it was produced by an amateur.  <br /> <br />I voted for both Clay and Taylor on AI...but at least Clay can put out a good product. I have never bought CDs from either artist. That is what I love about Rhapsody...I pay $10.00 a month to listen to thousands of albums and that helps me to decide if I want to purchase them.  <br /> <br />Realize that everyone has different tastes and don't be rude with your opinions. Stop thinking that others need to agree with you or their opinions are stupid. There are those that love Taylor's album and it doesn't cost anyone anything that they do. :-) <br /> <br />
1178,1,Should a 25 year old gorgeous woman who has got practically everything going for her be worried about a 37 year old washed up rapper leaving her for any reason. Just why?  Wake up Whitney please don't follow in her footsteps.
1179,5,"The Screaming Trees are well known to close watchers of the alternative scene in the US in the early nineties.  While other Pacific Northwest bands like Nirvana and Soundgarden were achieving nationwide success, the Trees attained notoriety only among the more discerning fans.  Part of the problem was that while they cuts some amazingly great tracks, none of their individual albums rated as indisputable masterpieces.  Their first several albums especially contain many weak tracks alongside utter gems.  Even their two best albums, SWEET OBLIVION and DUST, had their weak moments.  The problem is that the Pacific Northwest scene was on one level focused on album-oriented bands, while the Screaming Trees made great singles but less-than-spectacular albums.  Their other great disadvantage was that they were simply not a good-looking group.  Some of their were big, either in height or girth, and the frankly looked a bit menacing.<br /><br />That is why OCEAN OF CONFUSION is a nearly perfect introduction to the Screaming Trees.  And although I've enjoyed their albums, I find I almost never listen to any of their music except this compilation disc.  In fact, if someone gets this and is truly blown away by what they hear, the next album I recommend them getting is not one of the individual albums, but a second compilation, ANTHOLOGY:  SST YEARS 1985-89.  That disc covers their earlier years just as this one covers the second half of their career.  If one wants more after that, I recommend instead of more Screaming Trees, exploring the solo albums of the band's singer and songwriter Mark Lanegan, especially WHISKEY FOR THE HOLY GHOST.<br /><br />But though the individual albums weren't great as albums, all contained a few spectacularly great singles.  This anthology collects enough of these to prove that while other bands of the time like Nirvana, Mudhony, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains achieved more popular success, they were the equal of any of these bands musically and probably their superior.  They in fact exerted considerably influence on Nirvana in general and Kurt Cobain in particular, who was quite the fan of Mark Lanegan.  For anyone who wants to own the central works of alt-rock from the time when it moved from the periphery of popular music to its center, this album is indispensable.  Few of the songs will be familiar, though \\""Nearly Lost You\\"" was a minor hit at the time.<br /><br />Another remarkable thing about this album is that there is utterly no filler.  Every song is at least very good, while a number of absolutely spectacular.  \\""Nearly Lost You,\\"" as I mentioned, was a minor hit, but should have been a major one.  If you aren't hooked after the first two songs on the album, \\""Who Lies in Darkness\\"" and \\""Alice Said,\\"" there isn't much point in going further.  The rest of the album is more of the same, almost all of it very nearly as good.  And some of it better, in my humble opinion.  The three songs \\""Nearly Lost You,\\"" \\""Dollar Bill,\\"" and \\""More or Less\\"" are about as good as any three consecutive songs you'll ever hope to find on a grunge album.<br /><br />If you don't know the Screaming Trees but enjoy any of the bands associated with the Seattle scene in the early nineties, you will love this album.  I personally consider this to be some of the greatest music produced by that movement.  No one who loves music should be without this.nd probably their superior.  They in fact exerted considerably influence on Nirvana in general and Kurt Cobain in particular, who was quite the fan of Mark Lanegan.  For anyone who wants to own the central works of alt-rock from the time when it moved from the periphery of popular music to its center, this album is indispensable.

The three songs \\""Nearly Lost You,\\"" \\""Dollar Bill,\\"" and \\""More or Less\\"" are about as good as any three consecutive songs you'll ever hope to find on a grunge album.   <br /> <br />If you don't know the Screaming Trees but enjoy any of the bands associated with the Seattle scene in the early nineties, you will love this album.  I personally consider this to be some of the greatest music produced by that movement.  No one who loves music should be without this."
1180,4,"This is the first Virtue project I listened to.  I will probably try another of their tapes, but it is not because of how much I enjoyed this project.  I found it musically boring.  Looking from the reviews, I seem to be alone.  However, allow me to state that<br /><br />1) I enjoy some R&B (one reviewer said R&P), but am not a devotee to that style of music;<br /><br />2) I am particularly not familiar with Virtue; in other words, I'm not a fan.  (I'm willing to admit that I might enjoy another project better.)<br /><br />3) I am a fan of female vocalists and enjoy female groups; that is not a factor.  (I've listened to a Trin-I-Tee 5:7 project, and actually preferred that one to this.)<br /><br />Note:  I am not saying that this is poor quality musically, because that would be a lie.  I likewise am not saying that the girls are not good at harmonies, because likewise that would be a lie.  I am merely stating that this CD did not grab me, nor wow me, nor convince me that I need to hear the rest of their projects.<br /><br />Now, I'm moving from the music to the lyrics and theme of the project.  One thing to keep in mind is that the lyrics are more important than the music in Christian music, because the purpose of the group is in the words of the songs.  I found the lyrics very uplifting and encouraging.  The theme that I picked up is that each one of us is loved by God as we are, and that we have the freedom to be our redeemed selves, rather than to conform to what others think we should be.<br /><br />I would recommend reading the other reviews, and not make your mind up on this project solely by my word.  As I Christian, I realize these are my sisters in the Lord, and I have no doubts they are being obedient to His calling.  The message of this project as a whole and of the songs individually are ones that need to be heard."
1181,4,"Great songs!  Love Koops eccentricity and this album keeps up quite well.  Check out Moonbounce; it's fun, bouncy, silly, catchy, and quite, quite, gay.    I'm not put off by that one bit, and I hope no one allows any misguided notions of nomralcy (an appropriate term for the context) to get in the way of enjoying this album.  Whatever makes these guys do what they do so well all lends itself to their talent at making great music. <br /> <br />Keep up the great work!"
1182,5,"It doesn't get any better than that.   <br /> <br />Yes, there are some really fine songs here, with new versions of old favorites.  But, the absolute best song in this collection has got to be the duet with Natalie Cole, \\""Baby It's Cold Outside\\"".  I don't know of any other Christmas song that is sexy.  This one song is worth the price of the whole CD.  It makes me want to sit down with a glass of wine in front of the fireplace and watch the lights on the tree and dream a little, even when I don't have time for that. But, it's always worth it. <br /> <br />This is my second favorite CD ever (first is Nat King Cole and his rendition of \\""O Holy Night\\"", which is not at all sexy, but does make me cry it's so beautiful). Third, in case you're looking for more good xmas music, is Celtic Woman's \\""A Christmas Celebration\\"", which is obviously a totally different sound but still so good you stand still and hold your breath. <br /> <br />I asked for this for Christmas, even though I already have a copy.  That's a first.  But, I don't want to take any chances on not having a good copy of this beautiful music.   <br /> <br />Obviously, highly recommended."
1183,4,"This score is one of the classics. The score has earned much more credit than the movie itself. Whether that is fair I can't judge, I haven't seen the film. The music however is very good and a must for Mangione-lovers."
1184,5,"I like every song.  Unlike many other bands, this CD is just as good as their previous CD."
1185,4,"Hot Chip is a quirky UK band that reminds me of Aqueduct here in the US. After self-releasing some early EPs, the band issued its debut album \\""Coming On Strong\\"" in 2004 (released last year in the US), the band returns with its follow-up.<br /><br />\\""The Warning\\"" (11 tracks, plus 1 \\""hidden\\"" track, 52 min.) starts off tentatively with a somewhat chaotic \\""Careful\\"", but then dives straight into one irresitable track after another: \\""Boy From School\\"" (1st UK single) is a funky-ish joyful singalong, \\""Colours\\"" (2nd UK single), and \\""Over and Over\\"" (3rd UK single), which reminds me of the playfull Beck sound on \\""Guero\\"". \\""(Just Like We) Breakdown\\"" continues that theme, but in the second half of the album, the band turns much more introspective, with tracks like \\""Look After Me\\"", the title track, and \\""So Glad To See You\\"". The (untitled) hidden track is another (short) pensive song, quite nice. The album is extremely well sequenced, and before you know it, you find yourself hitting the replay button. In all, a great album.<br /><br />If you are wondering where I found out about this band, take a listen to WOXY \\""The Future of Rock and Roll\\"", formely a terrestrial radio station and now an internet-only station. WOXY has been bringing cutting edge indie-rock for more than 20 years. Check them out, and check out Hot Chip, you won't be disappointed!"
1186,4,"Chaka Khan has done a remix of many of her tunes that where above outstanding during the disco dance fever of the 1970's.  However, I have recently purchased a CD from Amazon.com called \\""Chaka Khan, Life is a Dance: The Remix Project\\"".  If rock pop music can be called classical then this particular creation of Chaka Khan and her musician associates can be truly considered classical.  One can not merely sit down and keep still while this music is playing, in particular if you are in a dancing mood in the first place, celebrating or just feel good and want to dance.  In the same instance, the remix is so skillfully directed and produced, if you just wanted to sit down and really enjoy this music for its composition as music this kind of attitude would be highly applicable as well."
1187,5,I love this CD.  Alan Silvestri's music is joyful.  Product and delivery were great.
1188,5,"Belle and Sebastian are a very recent discovery of mine, but I am severely addicted to their music. This album got me started, but I really don't think it's a five star album - but at the same time, it's not as low as a four star, so I had to round up. There are better albums out there, sure, even some by B&S... but this one is fantastic nonetheless. I highly recommend it."
1189,4,"For anyone interested in contemporary Christian music like myself who cut their teeth listening to Dion and the Belmonts during the rock 'n roll era, this type of cd is for you."
1190,5,"Hi all, I own this soundtrack and let me tell you I enjoyed it a lot, all the sounds form the game are here, and also some that I don't even remember, but it's a really, really good soundtrack, I highly recommend it, you won't regret it."
1191,5,"This release represents a supreme accomplishment by all the forces involved.  The Orchestre Philharmonique and Choeur de Radio France deliver an exceptional performance filled with such presence from the very opening of the Introduction Lente.  Chief conductor Myung Whun Chung's absolute dedication and irresistable dedication to orchestral textures and timbers and aural \\""scents and perfumes\\"" is simply incredible and enjoyable.<br /><br />The infinite variety of moods, \\""consonants and vowels\\"", emotions, complete stillness to sweeping grand motion are all here with an amazing respect for details that never becomes fussy due to the great comunicative powers of this performance.  The virtuosity of the Orchestre Radio France is deceptively non-apparent because they play with such style, elegance and passion.  The range of pianissimo to fortissimo is likewise spellbounding in its communicative and stirring power.<br /><br />Other winning points include the clarity of orchestral layers between the winds, brass, and percussion who all share such an amazing unity of articulations that are so easy to take for granted.  And the strings play with such elegance and silken style that are completely at one with the indications of Ravel's score.  Each section of the orchestra plays at such a high level of musicianship and this applies for both solo and unison passages. The solo woodwind passages in the final track Anime-Lent-Anime (General Dance Daphnis et Chloe) will leave you breathless.  Many thanks to the Radio Choeur for their special beauty and dedicated delivery as well.  An exciting and musically rewarding accomplishment by the maestro Myung Whun Chung and his superb orchestra!!!"
1192,5,Buy this CD if you need a break from the ordinary and mundane.  The lyrics and musical arrangements are beautiful and refreshing.  This piece of work is inspiring at a time when the majority of music is prepackaged and processed.  I enjoyed the entire CD and really cannot pick a favorite song . . . when is the last time you could honestly say that?  Looking forward to hearing more from The Scallions!
1193,4,"I originally bought this record back in the early 80s.  I remembered liking it, but didn't remember enough for me to ever to decide to go out a repurchase it on CD.  Well, I recently got a copy and was pleasantly surprised.  I understand why Sabbath purists might talk down about this effort, but who needs those people? ;)  While this album departed from Sabbath's darker sound it is still a very good album, and I'd guess if it didn't say Sabbath on the cover it would have gotten more attention as such.  Tony Iommi's sound is not as ominous as on some earlier albums, but the playing is great and there are a few moments of brilliance.  The odd part of this album is that, considering the internal struggles the band was going through, they seem to be having more fun playing.  I would have expected them to release a musically darker album during that time.   Some highlights for me are She's Gone, All Moving Parts Stand Still, Dirty Women, and You Won't Change Me.  If you like 70s hard rock in all its epic glory I think you'll appreciate this album.  Another great album in a year full of them.  Something about 1976..."
1194,5,"The late Dewey Redman spent very little time with his son Joshua, who started his jazz development at Berkeley High School. It's interesting to consider the dynamics of this collaboration: the duet cuts are by far the most exciting, and Dewey seems to be stretching his improvisational energy to the maximum, either to compete with or to encourage his son. Tenor sax duets have produced outstanding jazz before. My favorite live-session recordings of all time are of Wardell Gray and Dexter Gordon (The Hunt, The Chase). Dewey and Joshua don't interpenetrate each other's improv like that; they just take turns answering each other's solos, but they have different things to say. The only track on the album that falls short is the first, the title track, on which Dewey plays a musette of some sort without much skill."
1195,4,"After not being heard for 6 yrs. Big Mike came back just 10 months ago with his 4th album, and now is back with his 5th solo, another borderline 4 or 4.5 star album.  With 13 songs, Big Mike is on 11 of them.  1 is almost a classic, 4 are ok, and the other 8 are good or real good songs.  Guests are heavy, on 10 of the 13 songs, and rapping on 6 of the 13.  Production is nice and mostly handled by cats I never heard of.  Slash does the majority, 8 of the 13 songs (one Big Mike co-produced), Checmical and Crank each do 2 songs, and J Wood does 1 song.  The album starts real strong but the last few tracks kind of fall off probably keeping froma 4.5 star album, but it's still a very good album. For fans of real southern rap and fans of Big Mike this album should be in your collection.    #1 - 9.5 (great beat)  #2 - 8  #3 - 9 (nice beat)  #4 - 8 (f/ Slash & Sydnee)  #5 - 9 (f/ slash -- nice beat)  #6 - 9 (f/ slash -- good beat)  #7 - 8 (f/ Rich Black, Harold James & Slash)  #8 - 8.5 (f/ Slash & Sydnee -- nice beat -- deep lyrics)  #9 - 6.5 (f/ Man Kyne & Sly Fox)  #10 - 8.5 (f/ Dolla 1 -- tight beat)  #11 - 7.5 (Affiliated Gang no Big Mike (Trilogy, Peas, Willow Phats, Lil Manie, Lucky, Chemical)  #12 - 7 (f/ sly fox, man kyne, icece)  #13 - 6.5 (no Big Mike -- Willow Phats, Lil Manie, Lucky, Checmical, Peas)    Michael Barnett -- b. 1971 -- New Orleans, LA  CHeck all my reviews"
1196,4,"His mixing is near flawless, his track selection is good, but theres a lack of progression and style in this release. It sounds good, but it feels \\""put together\\"". it sounds like he took alot of great sounding tracks and mixed them in such a way that it sounds more like a compilation than a record. CD 1 is better in this respect. it tells more of a \\""story\\"" than cd 2. cd 2 is more upbeat, but the progression just isnt that great. great tracks though. overall, it is a good album, and i do recomend it. look into sander kleinenberg, ferry corsten, Deep Dish, paul van dyk, sasha, digweed, tiesto, or hernan catteneo. All Masters of the art"
1197,5,i've been with this album for some time now but i thought it fitting to write that there is no other album out that i listen to straight through more than this one... kinda funny that my roomate walked in today and i had just started the first tune... we talked a bit and i apologized and kindly said i had to get back to the album.  it's a masterpiece.  i've been reading some of these reviews regarding jeff's voice and that's part of what makes it... lyrics and arrangements are beautiful.  i consider this one of the greatest albums eva.
1198,5,"I have all Ann Callaway's recordings, including those where she's only recorded one or two cuts on a collection, and this is her best.  Consistently involving and intelligent, exceptionally well engineered.  If you like this, try Sibling Revelry with her sister, Liz Callaway."
1199,5,"Jesse Van Ruller may not be a name known to the general public but amongst jazz guitarists, he is already regarded as one of the finest living players.  <br /> <br />His teacher, the late great Wim Overgaauw instilled in Jesse a love for Jimmy Raney and Tal Farlow. While these and many other greats inform his style, Van Ruller never sacrificies his original voice.  <br /> <br />Jim Hall, Pat Metheny, John Scofield and Pat Martino have all praised him. Grab this album and you may find yourself doing the same. A truly exceptional talent."
1200,4,"This album is a lost gem of eightie's hard rock at its best. Featuring Pete Way (ex-UFO) and great guitar work by Paul Chapman (also ex-UFO), the songs are strong and catchy."
1201,5,"Good hip hop with lyrics over and beyond what was expected.  Prodigal Sunn talks about things others don't - Procrastinating, being Puzzled in life, living as Godz People, plus more.  Another good, quality CD from the Wu family."
1202,4,"While this understandably is not as good as their earlier works, this album is still wonderful.  My personal favorite is track 7, writtin by Julie Miller and originally performed by her as a duet with Emmylous Harris.<br /><br />Still full of the lush harmonies that Selah is known for, and a wonderful soundtrack to an afternoon."
1203,5,"I was really suprised by this album.  I live in Asia and never saw the \\""Rock Star\\"" tv show, so when I heard that INXS had a new singer I had my doubts, but this album is great.  J.D. Fortune has a great voice, which is similar to Hutchence's, and really fits with INXS's style and sound.  I wouldn't say that it is INXS's best album, but it's definitely not thier worst, and I think that any fan would be pleased."
1204,5,"A great example of Jimmy Smith's understanding and translation of the B-3 organ. This set with a handful of musicians has such a wonderful intimate touch. Great talents, great music!"
1205,1,"You would be better served buying any other release full of WZ's music instead of this one.  Part of the problem is the leaden execution of the music.  It sounds like a totally midi programmed score, drum machines, midi instruments and the like.  The second problem is that this release illustrates that, while WZ was a true genius musically, without his lyricism, his melodies can be repetitive.  Don't agree with me?  Then buy this CD, and listen to \\""Werewolves of London\\"" 5 times in a row."
1206,5,"Don't be fooled by the title, the lack of reviews, or even the bizarre-looking titles of the pieces found on this disc. There is some phenomenal and striking music here and none that can be found on most recordings. Leslie Howard has discovered music of astounding quality that will delight all Lisztians and Romantic pianophiles. Furthermore, the \\""nationalist\\"" theme of this Volume is original, and hearing Liszt filter English, French, Hungarian and Russian music flavors through his virtuosic piano-writing is quite entertaining.<br /><br />The first piece, \\""Szozat und Ungarischer Hymnus\\"" is based on two Hungarian works by Beni Egressy and Ferenc Erkel. Liszt skillfully combines the two works and employs his own improvisatory variations. I find this 10-minute escapade as rousing as an original Liszt Hungarian Rhapsody. The English anthem \\""God Save the King\\"" was frequently-used material for many 19th-century virtuosi, most notably Thalberg, Herz and Gottschalk. I have only heard Thalberg's paraphrase but I think Liszt does better. He avoids the glitter and dazzle of Thalberg and aims for dramatic gusto and even Chopinesque filigree; it makes a great alternative for July 4th music.<br /><br />Both versions of Liszt's \\""Canzone napolitana\\"" are recorded on this Volume and exhibit minute differences. This original composition bears little resemblance to anything national, not even Italian, and oozes with the poetry and gentleness of a high-quality salon nocturne. It is a fine piece comparable to the angelic consoling numbers from the Harmonies Poetiques et Religieuses. The blatantly Hungarian \\""Ungarische Nationalmelodien\\"" is a brief three-movement work with thematic material nearly identical to the Sixth Hungarian Rhapsody. The ensuing \\""Hussitenlied\\"" is a cheerful wallop of Lisztian grandeur: pounding chordal melodies, hymn-like respites, and fiery splashes of octaves.<br /><br />Seemingly out of nowhere Howard introduces three pieces that are some of the most sublime, noble, and profoundly beautiful ideas from Liszt's musical mind: Glanes de Woronince. This triptych of pieces stem from Liszt's thoughts while staying with Princess Carolyne Sayn-Wittgenstein in Russia. Who could have guessed that a piece with a rather banal title like \\""Ballade ukraine\\"" could be one of Liszt's most unjustly forgotten gems? Here is brooding, ethereal, and haunting music of cumulative power with as much exquisite music content as a Chopin ballade. Liszt imitates Chopin in the second \\""movement\\"" of the Glanes, \\""Melodies polonaise,\\"" which contains the same splendid lyricism and rhythmic interest of a Chopin polonaise. The last great piece from the Glanes, \\""Complainte,\\"" is another jewel of elegiac beauty and otherworldly sound. Liszt matches the pangs of Schubert's most heart-felt lyrical melodies and I can only hope that the entire Glanes de Woronince will receive greater admiration in the future. The caliber of these three pieces easily rival compositions from Liszt's own Annees de Pelerinage.<br /><br />I have already enough reason to award this poorly obscure recording five stars, but additional curiosities like the \\""La Marseillaise,\\"" \\""Vive Henri IV\\"" and the first version of the \\""Rakoczi March\\"" only add to my enthusiasm. Liszt created at least seven versions of the Rakoczi March, but this initial first version is peculiar. Its virtuosic treatment is typically over-the-top, but this version of the Rakoczi March also features a strange moment of Alkanesque dissonances not heard in the HR in which it is associated.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is perhaps one of the most important Liszt recordings to emerge from the Hyperion series. There is an engaging plethora here ranging from superior salon music to serious tone-poems. I implore the curious reader to sample the Glanes de Woronince. The \\""Ballade ukraine\\"" is a masterpiece that can rank with the darker works from Liszt's late period (Nuages Gris, La Lugubre Gondolas).ul ideas from Liszt's musical mind: Glanes de Woronince.

1207,5,"A lot of people are criticizing 'popaganda' because Head Automatica have somewhat changed their sound since the last album. I'm all for bands evolving their sound, which leads to overall improvment. As long as they keep some of their original sound, which this band has. Obviously one album is not going to sound like the last, that would be pointless. The band's definatly not hardcore rock, but to call it 'pop'... yeah i dont think so. Sure it's totally different from Glassjaw but I believe that was the point when Daryl started Head Automatica. I've never really been a fan of Glassjaw and much perfer this band, however I don't think either one of them show how much the other sucks. They both appeal to all kinds of people with different music taste. It's true that they just show how versatile Daryl's voice is.  <br /> <br />I loove all the songs on the record but if I was to name the ones that most stand out, in no order except for first one:  <br />1.Beating Heart Baby (always loved the song) <br />2.God <br />3.Laughing At You <br />4.Cannibal Girl <br />5.Lying Through Your Teeth <br /> <br /> <br />*** a fun listen and always cheers me right up!  .. also great to dance crazily to when home alone and bored one evening :)"
1208,5,"Casey Jones is the Side project of Josh  from Evergreen Terrace. Only slightly similiar to Evergreen in the music department and the fact that their lyrics are all about being straight edge, i enjoyed this album, although i am far from being straight edge myself. <br />While i may not agree with the idealogy of straight edge, that doesnt mean i cant enjoy the bands and music. Many of them, like Casey Jones, are just as fast and brutal as the non-straight edge bands out there today. All in all, i was very satisfied with this album."
1209,5,Johnny Cash's last album is simply brillant.  Sad he is gone.
1210,5,"These historic recordings are the ones that not only made Elvis THE superstar of the era, but also helped to establish Rock and Roll as the dominent pop music form for decades to come. This collection includes not only the hits from 1956, like Heartbreak Hotel, Don't Be Cruel, and Hound Dog, but also many forgotten classics like Ready Teddy and my favorite Money Honey!  A must for Elvis fans and students of Rock and Roll!"
1211,5,"Relax...here's the honest truth- the \\""Real Deal\\"" so-to-speak.  One of the most difficult musical genres to access is Exotica.  Most people don't even know what the f@#k it is, and arguably for good reason,  Its difficult to discover and represents a slightly obscure period of cultural history.  But if you happen to discover it this is probably one of the best albums to date in its class. (And if you haven't discovered Exotica, this may be the stronest gateway into such a bizarre world.)  Baxter now has a real \\""feel\\""--its finally groove-oriented while retaining its melodical and harmonic sense.  Cooler than the at-times corny stuff that Baxter and others made before its inception while still  capturing some strong essences of the original style;  It should not be compared to Brazilian Samba and Bossa Nova, true Brazilian genres critical to the advancment of music as an artform. You should compare it, rather, to its own soothing sense of \\""escapism\\"", a product of its own invention."
1212,5,"THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS I HAVE HEARD IN A LONG TIME. THE FACT THE GIRLS WRITE THEIR OWN MUSIC IS A BONUS, THE ALBUM IS JUST ONE GOOD TRACK AFTER THE OTHER. CAN'T WAIT FOR THE DELUX EDITION."
1213,4,"this is an album that is begging to be discovered.  this artist is just on the verg of hitting it big.  you can already tell that his voice and songwriting style are well more advanced than Baron's actual age.  his voice has a Hank Williams twang to it and the lyrics have the storytelling mastery of Johnny Cash.  there are blends of older style country/western in the beginning tracks, but as the songs progress, there is almost a transformation into the independent genre.  almost as if the songs appear in chronological order, beginning with his roots and earlier influences and ending with his own take on music.  the song \\""open door\\"" would certainly be a top single on the country charts if he had a big record label backing him, and probably will be if any label is lucky enough to sign him."
1214,5,I bought this CD for my husband who is an avid Emmy Lou fan.  He popped it in the CD player while on a recent trip and I absolutely loved it.  Their voices compliment each other so well.
1215,5,"This was one of the very first albums I owned. It was given to me in sixth grade and I absolutely fell in love with it. I had been exposed to E.L.O. through a friend's older sister and I knew that I had to have more. I played the LP so much that it eventually got scratched and was unplayable. I worked my way through several cassette copies before finally buying the original CD release of it. When I heard that it was getting remastered and released with all the original tracks added back to it, I knew that I would have to buy it again even though I ahd the bonus tracks on \\""Afterglow\\"". It was worth every penny. I am transported back to sixth grade every time I play this one. Even the tracks that I didn't appreciate as an eleven year old (\\""Another Heart Breaks\\"", \\""Here Is The News\\"") leave me mesmerized all these years later. <br /> <br />In my opinion...this is Jeff Lynne's true masterpiece."
1216,5,"If you read this review, buy the album !!!! <br /> <br />The long awaited second album has had me pacing the floor in anticipation. 6 Months on I am still listening to it regularly, which I have to say is unusal for me as it takes something really special to get my attention.  <br /> <br />To my mind it opens fresh images each time I hear it. The whole concept of the album, though evident in each song, changes daily for me and my mood.  <br /> <br />My favourite track on the album has to be The Kill, Ive never heard any other singer get as much feeling into his singing voice as Jared Letto, the guy is truely amazing. <br /> <br />Buy the album you wont be disappointed !!! <br /> <br />PROVEHITO IN ALTUM."
1217,5,This live concert captures Gabriela fluidly playing Chopin on piano. Perfect music to listen to while reading or holding a glass of wine and savoring the day's accomplishments. Add this to your Amazon shopping cart and you won't regret it.
1218,1,"WTH is wrong with Amazon lately. I tried to post 4 reviews and none of them was posted. Also I couldn't see where I got helpful/non-helpful votes. Also I'm starting to get sick of removing reviews for writing improper words. So someone wrote F + U + C + K or C + R + A + P or A + S + S, its not a nuclear assault on Washington for godsake!!    Anyway I'm not really gonna review this. I just wanted that someone will see this note so I've decided to take this pile of junk as a victim. No words can describe how horrible it is. And to believe it's not even Limp's worst. Everybody knows Limp Bizkit sucks, I'll just be wasting my time reviewing this.     Hit \\""YES\\"" if you agree that Limp Bizkit sucks, otherwise hit \\""NO\\""."
1219,3,"I agree substantially with the previous review.  For afro-latin music fans, this CD is a treat.  The chants are beautiful and the mix with more modern sounds is seamless and unique.  However, I have 2 disclaimers.  First, this album is not a typical Carlinhos album.  He does not do much singing on it at all, except maybe some coros.  Second, and perhaps more importantly, this album is just over 26 minutes long.  That makes this CD more like an \\""EP\\"" in my book.  At over $24, that makes this one of the highest prices I've ever paid per minute of music."
1220,5,"I first encountered TS when they opened up for my fave band of all time, Los Amigos Invisibles, in Baltimore back in Feb. 2005. I arrived late, and I was kicking myself for it. Lead man Christian Ulrich energizes the entire room with his presence -- booming vocals and powerful drums. But the mixture of Ulrich, Ethan White (keyboards) and Jason Kriveloff (bass) as a whole is a simple, yet perfect blend resulting in a unique funky, jazzy, dancey sound.<br /><br />The only tune on this disc that *didn't* tickle my fancy (much) is \\""You Found a Way.\\"" But that's just me. This leaves nine songs out of ten that I can't get enough of. I constantly put this disc on while driving, and at home when I'm working on the computer. The album gets more infectious with repeated listenings. \\""How's Your Life?\\"" is my favorite (an easy choice), followed by the close seconds \\""Why\\"" and \\""Enjoy it Now.\\"" \\""Epic\\"" is an all-instrumental offering that reminds me a lot of early non-vocal Level 42 tunes (say, like \\""43\\"").<br /><br />This disc gets my highest recommendation. And, if you get a chance to see TS in person, don't pass up the opportunity!"
1221,1,"I am a huge Tom fan. I go to his concerts and buy all of his CDs.  I must say that I have been disappointed by this CD because it's entirely made of old recordings.  There's a new photo on the cover, but that's all that is new here.  So if you've bought your share of Tom CDs over the years, you want to check out the track info before you guy this one. <br /> <br />Now, Tom has been on tour and I STRONGLY recommend that you go see him next year when he comes through your city.   <br /> <br />The other thing really annoying is that on the CD where you'd expect information about the music or the recording co., you instead get a large warning label from the FBI on pirating."
1222,5,"to rate this album, i'll say its falls in between illmatic & it was written. i am... is like a mix of illmatic & nas's 2nd lp. he spits live rhymes over great beats. every album after this blew except for stillmatic. but yeah nastradamus cant touch this, it was written cant touch this, gods son cant touch this and neither can streets disciple. this is a must have even though its the most slept on and not talked about that much. yeah it only had one hit which was hate me now but still its a good album."
1223,5,"Reissue of Norma Jean's second release O' God The Aftermath. Wow, what an album!!! Less melodic than Bless The Martyr, Kiss The Child mind you, but still just a exciting and brutal. The bonus material in the deluxe edition is cool too."
1224,4,"Ok, all the songs here are not original, each one is interpreted in their (AI finalists) own way.  While the others sounded ok and a few good, one stands out from the rest:  Elliot Yamin's \\""Moody's Mood For Love\\"".  Clearly, he sounded the most original- his voice untouched by studio technology.  I have never heard this kind of voice before.  I never intended to buy a AI 5 cd (although I watched the show) but hearing Moody's Mood For Love in a restaurant in New York one night, I was completely blown away and decided to get one soon.  I can't wait for this guy to have a cd of his own. I'm hooked. <br /> <br />Of course, I listened to the other tracks.  Here is my take on the other notable tracks: <br /> <br />1. \\""What About Love\\"" by Melissa McGhee-  She sounded like Camille Velasco of Season 3.  Big voice, raspy and not-so-bad interpretation. though I prefer to listen to Heart's original version. <br /> <br />2. \\""Wanted Dead or Alive\\"" Chris Daughtry- He was my favorite to win the competition.  This track is pretty good.  Although it doesn't sound too original- I could have mistaken him to any 90's alternative band. <br /> <br />3. \\""Takin' it to the Streets\\"" Taylor Hicks-  Another favorite contestant of mine.  This song is just ok though.  I would rather see him perform than listen to this song.  Again, he doesn't sound original even in the competition- I would rather listen to the one and only Joe Croker.  But I admit I liked his personality. <br /> <br />SO-SO Tracks: <br /> <br />1. \\""Father Figure\\"" Ace Young.  Yeah, he is good looking and can sing.  Not a bad version but this song tells us his limited voice range. <br /> <br />2. \\""Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I'm Yours) Lisa Tucker-  The song is ok, nice vocal range but I think the song is not for her. <br /> <br />3. \\""Midnight Song to Georgia\\"" Paris Bennet-  She is a perfect example of a really, really talented kid who does tend to overdo songs (remember Jennifer Hudson?).  As always said on the show, she always singsongs that are too much for her. But I still think she deserves an album of her own. <br /> <br />FORGET IT: <br /> <br />1.  \\""Superstition\\""  Bucky Covington- I dont have much to say but I skip this track a lot. <br /> <br />2.  \\""I'm Every Woman\\""  Mandisa.  Here's another over-the-top performer that tend to overdo songs.  I liked her at first then I realized she sounded like a Aretha-Chaka Khan-Whitney clone and lost my interest in her.  She's probably gonna make it in gospel music- but pop or R&B, I wouldnt even bother. <br /> <br />3.  \\""Walkin' After Midnight\\""  Kellie Picker.  Not the best rendition of this song. Again, this song is evidence of her limited vocal range.   <br /> <br />4.  \\""Think\\""  Katharine McPhee-  I'm sure this track is a big disappointment to her fans.  Its the wrong song for her and again this shows us her inconsistent singing abilities.  I think she will be better off on broadway or theatre.   Her version of \\""Think\\"" is skippable and forgettable. Anyone who haven't seen her on TV but have listened to this song will definitely agree with me. <br /> <br />5.  \\""When I Fall In Love\\""  Kevin Covais.  His being in the final 12 shows what america wants: novelty above talent.  How I wish that girl named Ayla Brown made it to the final 12 rather than him.  He's a nice kid though. <br /> <br /> <br />I bought this album for one reason:  TRACK 9. <br />"
1225,5,"I hate hearing that question, don't you?  It's like hearing Lebron James is the next Michael Jordan.  But Coldplay is Coldplay, and that's good enough for me.  This album shows maturity for a group where expectations were extremely high.  And where it might be lacking some of the sing-a-long songs of Rush Of Blood To The Head, this is an excellent album.  Chris owns the piano and his falsetto has never sounded better (and what's also great about Coldplay is that they sound just as good live, which is huge since many bands in this technological age do not).  Songs like Fix You, What If?, and Talk show us that Coldplay will be around for a long, long time.  And yes, during that time, we will hear things like \\""the next U2!\\"" or \\""reminds me a little of Radiohead.\\""  But time will tell that we will start comparing every upcoming band to Coldplay, as they will probably topple all other competition.  Can't wait for the next Coldplay CD!"
1226,4,"After listening to just a few tracks of Sadus' new album, the listener should be able to tell that this is no ordinary thrash record. Sure, it's still mighty fast, heavy, ferocious, and ripping, but it also has several differentiating elements. These elements should help Sadus stand apart from the legions of other thrash bands making appearances in 2006 (i.e. Sodom, Demiricous, etc.) For one, frontman Darren Travis' vocals on \\""Out For Blood,\\"" Sadus' seventh album, are abnormally high pitched (sounding like a match between Death and Exodus), and are thus a bit annoying at first (but only at first!). Next, most of these songs have audible bass parts. Steve DiGiorgio lays down some beeping, slapped bass notes which wouldn't sound completely out of place on a Red Hot Chili Peppers, Primus, or Mudvayne album. Thirdly, the songs on this album are quite a bit longer than, say, a Slayer song (these songs average over five minutes in length). And, lastly (and most importantly), \\""Out For Blood\\"" is generally slower, more melodic, and catchier than most thrash releases. It offsets fast, bruising numbers with mid-tempo chuggers. For instance, the album opener, \\""In The Name Of...\\"" is bolstered by a throbbing bass, a blisteringly fast guitar lead, and quick, pounding drums. But the next two songs, \\""No More\\"" and \\""Smackdown,\\"" have slowly pounding rhythms (plus track two features some strange but efficient computer/robotic sound effects). Later on, \\""Down\\"" and \\""Freedom\\"" both fall into a catchy, if sluggish groove, and \\""Cursed\\"" features an ambient intro and outro. But these slower songs are interspersed with scorching riff onslaughts. The title track, \\""Sick,\\"" and \\""Freak\\"" all prove Sadus can still shred your speakers, as these songs are blindingly fast and have breakneck rhythms with barrages of brutal, fiery guitars. So, whether attacking the jugular or pulling back on the reigns, Sadus prove they can rock efficiently, and are (or should be) one of thrash/speed metal's most famous and recognizable bands.recognizable bands."
1227,5,"If you're not familiar with Hank Sr. and want a true understanding of American music of the 20th century or hell, of American culture in general for that matter, buy this.This is the man who has influenced country, rockabilly, folk and rock for over 50 years now. Still today it's not hard to find a band somewhere covering these songs.And still there is some young person out there discovering Hank for the first time and being blown away by it. I was. I discovered Hank when I was a teenager in the early 90's, the age of Kurt Cobain, Smashing Pumpkins, etc, and to me he tapped into something that they never could.  Hank is THE classic country singer, but his music transcends time, regions, and all labels and genres. It's simply American music. And very very human."
1228,4,"'Visions of Love, Mozart Arias' sung by one of our leading operatic sopranos, Renee Fleming, is a nice listen more for the fact that it is Mozart than the fact that it is being done by Renee Fleming. But then, if you happen to be a Renee Fleming fan, you can have your cake and eat it too.<br /><br />I confess I have been influenced in my overall rating by one of the other reviewers, who obviously has much more experience with recordings of Mozart arias. But from my point of view, someone who just likes to listen to female operatic and art song vocals, this is a great change from the recordings of French chansoms and German Lieder, which all start to sound like variations of Shubert's 'Ave Maria'.<br /><br />Here, we get the orchestrations of that all time greatest master of the 18th century opera, the utterly incomparable Wolfgang, for those of us who don't have the patience to sit through, or even do garden weeding through a complete performance of Don Giovanni (although I am partial to complete recordings of Die Zauberflote, The Magic Flute).<br /><br />This is probably not the best album with which to sample Fleming for the first time. As this is the first of her albums I have reviewed, I'll let you know as soon as I find it.<br /><br />Meanwhile, if you can get this one at a good discount, you will enjoy the Mozart!"
1229,3,"There is a golden rule for singing French melodies (I dare not use accent markings on Amazon anymore - they are incorrectly encoded in the execution): that rule is... pronounce the French correctly.<br /><br />Of course there is a great deal more to it than that, but if one doesn't meet this simple and basic rule, all the rest is virtually wasted.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Christopher Maltman's French is not of a sufficiently high standard to make his rendering of these melodies an unmitigated delight. It's a pity - the voice itself is pleasant, with an attractive timbre like a quite dark oak patina, but le pronunciation is impossible to ignore. I'm bound to say, also, that the interpretation of the pieces seems rather blustery at times, rather than delicate or robust as may be called for. The melodies themselves are so beautiful, and I adore hearing good baritones singing the French song repertoire, which is why I purchased this recording. Malcolm Martineau is a fine accompanist, but he cannot make up for the somewhat unsatisfactory vocal performance.<br /><br />The basic vocal material is good. This is no doubt why he has impressed in previous recordings, but I am flabbergasted to read that his recording of Schumann's Dichterliebe was considered \\""superbly executed\\"" (Grammophone) and that he \\""leaps in a single bound into the fronk rank of Lieder interpreters today\\"". German Lieder require the same sort of detailed word-painting which was so very ABSENT from this recording of Debussy melodies. As Christopher Maltman is so experienced a performer, it's not even a case of my hoping he will develop and mature further as an artist. One presumes that Mr Maltman has already gone through such a process. As a result, I cannot hope that his future performances will show a development in interpretation that will allow him to sweep in finer brush-strokes - I must regretfully say I shall not be tempted by future recordings of this singer.<br /><br />I cannot unequivocally recommend this CD, unfortunately. I'd have liked to give it 3 and a half stars, but the lack of interpretative quality and the poor French make it impossible for me to give this recording 4 stars... so 3 it must be.<br /><br />Alternative recommendations: Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau's exceptionally fine recording of Liszt Lieder; Poulenc Complete Songs (incl. the excellent Gedda and often good Souzay); Debussy melodies sung by Sandrine Piau... Debussy melodies sung by Elly Ameling (occasionally accented French, but what an exquisite sound)... Debussy melodies sung by Christiane Oelze; French chansons and melodies sung by Rachel Yakar who is a consummate interpreter. These are extremely beautiful recordings indeed, and any serious collector of recordings of French melodies needs to own them. For those who just want some beautiful 19th century French vocal music, these alternative recordings mentioned are also very highly recommended.y recommend this CD, unfortunately.

1231,5,"BUY THIS. STOP WASTING TIME ON SOME OF THAT GARBAGE ON THE RADIO AND PICK THIS UP. GREAT BEATS. GREAT LYRICS. AND FUNNY. ALSO IF U CAN LISTEN TO THE KANYE AND LB SONG \\""I SEE NOW\\"" I LIKE THAT SONG."
1232,3,"Dikers have been around for a while -  this is in fact their fourth effort (!). They started out when they were just adolescents and have gradually matured. They seem more musically confident and their poetic lyrics are original (whereas in their first two albums they had a friend from another band write them - really!). Still, for a fourth effort, it could be better. I still think, in fact, that their best album is their second, the self-reflexively titled \\""Se Escribe Sin 'C'\\"" (this translates as \\""There's No 'C'\\"", in reference to their name.) Singer Iker (maybe that is where their band name comes from?) is now well into his 20s but still has a distinctly adolescent voice... if only it could be a tad deeper! Overall, though, this record is decent. Think distorted guitars and catchy melodies. Think a less polished version of American groups like Taking Back Sunday, New Found Glory and Finch."
1233,5,"Yeah I know that this is not the most original outfit out there, but I really care less. Anyway this cd for the most part is pretty sick. I do find this particular style of metalcore totally overated but there are a few groups in it that pretty tight, including this band. Unearth combines melodic metal with hardcore, very original. Anywho, they do a good job with it and definitely met my expectations with this cd. All the songs are good, but in my opinion 2,3,5,6,7,8,and 10 are the best. I think there is something that is missing, though I can't put my finger on it. Not much for me left say but do yourself afavour and check these guys out."
1234,4,"I am not really a fan of this band. I always wrote them off as an AIC ripoff that played senseless andgry Nu-Metal. This album is different. They experimented a little, and put some variety in their songs. Like another reviewer said, I am reminded al of Metallica's \\""Load\\"" and \\""ReLoad\\"" at times, and that is not really a bad thing. Definetly worth the price! If you like rock, pick this up."
1235,2,"First let me say I am a huge fan of Klaus Badelt.  I feel he is one of the few bright spots in the world of musical scores.  His work in Pirates of the Caribbean was just brilliant, and I expected another spectacular work here.   The music is very good, not as good a PITC, but still very good.   My major complaint is that there's not enough music here.   I am sure the movie is about 2 hours long, then why only 30 minutes or so of the score? <br /> <br />   And what is up with the 3 God awful songs that start this cd?!!?  Absolutely a painful listen.  A note to the musical industry:  Stop filling the CD's of musical scores with songs that  are just there to fill a CD.   Fill it with what people want.....THE SCORE!!!!!  People that would buy this cd are buying it for the score, certainly not the songs. <br /> <br /> That's why the low rating.  The music would get 4 stars if there was more of it."
1236,5,"I hate to compare musicians w/other artists....but, I was reminded a little of Santana and Creed; but it is so completely Scott Thomas. I don't think I could live without this CD. Scott isn't afraid to use his voice in every range possible. The lyrics and music are powerful and sometimes even a little raw. But that's what makes this CD completely \\""real.\\"" The cd takes the listener through a rush of high energy, & emotive songs that just leave a person wanting more and more. If you can find a copy, get it! Look for his other CD, Lovers & Thieves...I highly recommend it as a follow up..."
1237,5,"Yet another fantastic album from Girls Aloud. Definitely Pop music at it's greatest. Although \\""Chemistry\\"" admittedly doesn't live up to their second album, \\""What Will the Neighbours Say\\"", it's definitely worth your buy.  <br /> <br />1. \\""Intro\\"" - 9/10 Short, but upbeat, catchy, and a great way to start off the album <br /> <br />2. \\""Models\\"" - 5/10 Arguably the weakest track on this album. The melody and lyrics would be utterly forgettable if they weren't so bad. I was actually disappointed with this one. <br /> <br />3. \\""Biology\\"" - 10/10 Absolutely wonderful, probably my favourite song on this album. The melody's a sort conglomeration of pop and a million other styles, while the lyrics I thought were very catchy and clever. <br /> <br />4. \\""Wild Horses\\"" - 7/10 I'm sort of indifferent about this one. I suppose it takes some warming up to. Not the best on that album, and a little lackluster. <br /> <br />5. \\""See the Day\\"" - 8.5/10 I always enjoy it when Girls Aloud slows down there songs, and this ballad is done very well. The lyrics could use a little bit more oomph, but I'm not complaining. <br /> <br />6. \\""Watch Me Go\\""  - 10/10 If \\""Biology\\""'s not my favourite track, than this one certainly is. It took a little warming up to at first, but the grunge/rap/hip-hop part in the middle is absolutely get-up-and-dance AWESOME. The lyrics are a little risque, but that only contributes to the song. (Especially the last few stanzas) <br /> <br />7. \\""Waiting\\"" - 8.5/10 Fast-paced, good beat.  <br /> <br />8. \\""Whole Lotta History\\"" - 10/10 I love this song. The ballad style is better done with this song than with \\""See The Day\\"". The  lyrics were pleasant surprise to me, and the melody is overall fabulous. <br /> <br />9. \\""Long Hot Summer\\"" - 9/10 The first song I listened to from this album, and the one that got me hooked. Another up-tempo song that makes you want to get up and dance. (Or, at least me). <br /> <br />10. \\""Its Magic\\"" - 8/10  Not the best that this album has to offer, but still pretty good. Pop song with a softcore techno accompaniment. <br /> <br />11. \\""No Regrets\\"" - 9/10 Another great slower song. A little departure from the norm, with almost Spanish undertones. Interesting lyrics. Excellent vocals. <br /> <br />12. \\""Racey Lacey\\"" - Great song to end it on. Bubblegum pop, energetic, great beat. Implied risque lyrics always make it more fun."
1238,5,"One of the best this kind of pop 60-70's. <br />All the big hits. <br />Comprehensive \\""poster\\"" booklet."
1239,2,"Jefferson Airplane was one of the hottest groups of the 1960s and definitely the best band from the San Francisco area. They would have done their legacy a huge favor and thrown this album in the trash rather than releasing it. I gave it two stars for the Jorma Kaukonen tune \\""Trial by Fire.\\"" Your money would be well spent on anything by JA from the 1966 to 1970 period and pretend that this album never existed. This was written by perhaps the Airplane's biggest fan so this is not an idle slam."
1240,5,"just saw chuck live in frederick, md and bought the CD. he's great live and the CD captures it well too. really mellow acoustic folk. has a style and songs that your soul has been waiting to hear.  <br /> <br />i'd compare to damien rice, but better."
1241,4,"Morrissey's last disc, \\""You are the Quarry\\"", was a brilliant piece of work where almost every other song sounded like it could be a single.  This new cd is the flip side of the coin.  There is hardly a song here that screams single.  This new cd is, despite Morrissey being in love, a sonically dark work without any instantly engaging choruses.  A fairly strong set of songs nonetheless."
1242,3,"Haha this song goes to show the dark wicked side of RBX, taken from his debut album \\""The RBX Files\\"". Not his best song, but a rock hard song from an even better album"
1243,5,"So Stephan Jenkins breaks up with actress Charlize Theron and as a result we're treated to 14 pop rock gems that tell us the whole story.  No, this isn't like their debut...and it's not like Blue either. But it's still definitely got the signature 3EB sound and Stephan Jenkin's awesome songwriting. This is a throbbing summer-anthem CD, hands down.  They've got the same 3EB sound going on, but it sounds more studio polished. The timing is great though- usually a 3EB song starts off with Brad H. on drums, and that launches into the guitar bits & Stephan's singing.<br /><br />Lyrically, it sounds as if 90% of the album recalls his (Stephan Jenkins) and Charlize's relationship and their falling out, and you'd think that it'd get annoying and old but really it never does. His outlook is at times painful, but it's also fresh and entirely relatable.<br /><br />In songs like \\""Crystal Baller\\"" he's clearly up for making ammends, putting the past behind them, \\""taking the high road\\"" as he says... and just wiping the slate clean.  It's easy on the ears and I'm sure plenty of people would like to adopt it as their own personal relationship anthem.<br /><br />Then there's the fast story of a song \\""My Hit and Run\\"" which is almost like a dream sequence; the pavement is wet and lights are flashing...he crashes and thinks he sees Her at his \\""hit and run\\"".  Metaphors all around, it's a great play by play.<br /><br />\\""Misfits\\"" is another great song typical of Stephan Jenkins, ever the pensive outsider, he claims \\""My people are the Misfits, the ones that don't fit in\\"" and he makes it sound not at all like a bad thing to be a part of his group. (Cool haunting overtones in the song too.)<br /><br />\\""Self Righteous\\"" features SJ with Kimya Dawson. this song is slightly eery and almost out of place on the cd if you ask me. It's not bad, but it's not great either. It's really moody and vague and I'm not sure how I feel about it. Vocally they sound really interesting together, and I always enjoy hearing SJ use his voice at different registers so points there.<br /><br />\\""Palm Reader\\"" is a really cool song, which *surprise* recollects Charlize Theron and all that once was.  He says he \\""reads horoscopes in magazines\\"", \\""especially yours...in the sign of a leo, the regal ones, but man you let your claws show...when will they let me go?\\""  I think it's great that he doesn't even try to hide the fact that he got messed up over the situation, and instead he used it for his art.<br /><br />\\""Good Man\\"" closes the cd (well, before the hidden track) and is painfully honest and well written a la classic SJ style.  He's holding on, grasping at anything he can in hopes of leaving a good lasting impression. He wants forgiveness and seals his own resolution when he acknowledges that \\""All that you wanted, was a Good Man\\""  He's overwhelmed and mystified (and I'm just grateful that he was willing to share it with all of us cuz it makes for damn good songs)<br /><br />The hidden track is a really excellent song as well. It's easily become one of my own personal anthems. \\""Another Life\\"" is about moving forward and starting over, & being grateful for even being able to do both.<br /><br />This is quite a few steps away from their debut, but it's still a great album.

1244,4,"Probably their best cd.  I'd say its more odd and 'geeky' than the green album.  If you like slightly more poppy or mainstream music the green album might suit you better.  But I remember the first time I saw the Buddy Holly video, and thought it was so awesome, yet geeky so my pick is the Blue album. <br />"
1245,4,"I bought this album when it first came out, thats right I said album. I loved it then, and it's still great!"
1246,5,"Simply one of the best cds in my collection. In the genre of guitar fingerstyle music, he rates up there with Michael Hedges and Billy McLaughlin...Superb sound.  Great harmonics.  This cd is sure to please.  Seeing him live is an even better treat. Great sound from a truly great man."
1247,5,"I first heard this album on New Year's Eve, 1965-66 and fell in love with Bill Cosby's humor.  I'd only seen him as a tennis star, spying all over the world with his white partner, Robert Culp (TV show) and was amazed that a black person could be so articulate, while humerous (yup, I'm lily white and grew up in the segregated South).  Bill Cosby and his comedy was my first huge leap toward realizing that folks who LOOK diffeent aren't really different after all.  This \\""record\\"" is timeless, clean and one you can enjoy with your children.  For the past 30 years, I've said \\""R-I-G-H-T\\"" when I didn't believe a statement and have helped keep Bill's humor alive for many generations to come."
1248,5,"I was browsing through the free downloads, and what a gift! Rays voice is smooth, the lyrics profound, and the message clear! Five stars, definately!"
1249,3,"Make no mistake - Zabiela is one of the most technically gifted DJs out there. But this compilation just doesn't work. There aren't enough big tunes on it; most are obscure, as if Zabiela can't decide what kind of music he really wants to play. I always look forward to the eclectic-ness of James Zabiela's compilations, but I think he struck out this time. <br /> <br />The mixing, though, is impeccable, as one might expect."
1250,5,"This for me is the best In Flames album...very solid, creative, and epic. the songs made me feel as if i were in sweden...i love Everlost Part II. The female vocals are very strong. Behind Space is the best track on the album by far."
1251,3,Fair <br />too much talk <br />other CD's much better <br />Don't waste your money
1252,5,"The music fits the series very well and the musicians on the soundtrack are just amazing.  Morcheeba, Depeche Mode, Morphine, and Enigma are the ones that stand out the most.  Morcheeba have other cds out that are just as amazing as the song that is on the soundtrack itself.  Enigma is just as amazing and just like Morcheeba and even Depeche Mode have other cds out that are wonderful.  I also recommend getting the Sliver soundtrack if you like this one."
1253,5,You cannot go wrong with this combo. Shuffering and Shmiling is a classic Fela track that you should know and love. But I want to point out that No Agreement is a stand-out Fela track on par with Zombie. Both of these tracks are among Fela and Africa 70 funkiest
1254,2,"This cd sucks, even for LB.  The irritating vocals of lead singer Fred Durst grow even more agitating on this disc as you would think a 30 some-odd year old man would stop rapping like a little kid whines.  Still way better than Korn, but this puts the nail in the coffin...no wonder nu-metal is a dying breed."
1255,4,"Yes I confess I bought this a) the cover looked soo cool b) The Nervous Return sounded quite cool name and the songs have cool names C) theres the tenuous Blink 182 link d) I can sniff out good albums and I am 90 percent effective. OK this is post punk, stoneresque rock if you like punk pop then this record might just be too difficult for you, but those who like the idea of fugazi/Pennywise mixed with queens of the stone age with a melodic edge and a sense of urgency then you will like this, the songs fade in and breakdown with amazing guitar work. Oh yeah the vocalist has a hint of 80s about him that is most prominent on So and So from such and such. I can reccommend this to anyone who is sick and bored of generic bands that don't inspire, the first listen may not hook you but be persistent . not for everyone."
1256,5,"This is an amazing CD. My friend introduced me to it last November. I made a copy of it and i listened to it for a month straight. I love their unique sound, with the synthezizers and tons of screaming. Their lyrics are very strange, but amazing and kind of gory. The best songs are \\""And the smokers and children will be cast down\\"", \\""If you like me check yes ,if you don't I'll Die\\"",\\""stabbing art to death\\"",\\""the dissonace of discontent\\"" and \\""Matthias replaces Judas\\"". You must get this CD. It is well worth it."
1257,2,"I have not had the privilege of hearing the whole CD but my favourite song is the Anna Rexia song...however, I cannot make out all the words for it.  Could somebody help me out with the lyrics??  e-mail me at longhair82@yahoo.ca  But it is quite interesting...and a genius title for the song."
1258,5,"Sorry, but I humbly disagree with other reviewers here. Dame Joan, in 1981, was still singing fantastically. The age is somewhat apparent, but... who cares!  That sound! I love Marilyn Horne in this period, and Pavarotti is fantastic. But what really moves me about the whole package is Joan Sutherland. I adore Marilyn Horne in the basso cantante role: this is the turn that makes this trio fantastic: no wobbly bass! Brava Tutti."
1259,5,"So many pieces on this album are jewels.  \\""Le fille aux cheveux de lin\\"" and \\""Nocturnes for Orchestra - Sirenes\\"" are particularly heavenly.  \\""The Sea at Dawn\\"" has an amazing sense of freshness and motion to it and is well placed at the beginning of the CD.  A few of the songs on here make excellent background music but lack memorable themes.  I wish I could wake up to this CD every morning, truly."
1260,2,"...but this Yes fan is also sick of these compilations.  An example of what I, and everyone, mean: Roundabout has now been on: 1. Fragile 2. Yessongs 3. Classic Yes 4. Yesyears 5. Yesstory 6.

Pick another song, such as I've seen all good people- it's staggering.  Only the Who My generation comes close.  I'm sorry, I just can't recommend this, even being quite a Yes fan.  I'm throwing in the towel, I can't continue getting Yes CDs with the same songs on them.  Enough is enough..."
1261,4,"In the vein of Anand Clique's \\""Click\\"" album, Pantera's \\""Far Beyond Driven\\"" and Sepultura's \\""Arise\\"", Chimaira has brought a classic hardcore/thrash/tribal/double-bass action sound to us.  It's bands like Chimaira, God Forbid, and In Element that make 2005/2006 one hell of a metal season! <br /> <br />"
1262,5,"The album is Funky, Jazzy, Soul, Gospel all rolled in one. The other artist give it a groove that is sweet, tender and is a light to those who has the breath of life and is a living soul. I think that this is one of Bootsy's great down to eart sounds. It brought me from the edge of depression jamming and enjoying bootsy at his best. The mix master did a great job with the volume of each voice on the album. It takes the Bootsy Fans to many deminsions. I purchased the album because, \\""I'm Funky and I Know it.\\"" Don't Let Them Put You Down, took me on a trip when people around me only talk negetive and step on my spirit. Love Gangster reminded me of what I wished everyone in the world would do. Just by having Macy Grey sing on the album put it in another universe. \\""I Get So Emotional.\\"" \\""If I Get This Kind of Love Whats an Album Bill?\\"" Soul Sister is like the Black Hole of the Big Band, like Eve the Mother of Us All.

If someone listens to this album and cannot groove on it, they are not a true Bootsy Fan and a George Clinton fan. One more thing, \\""This albums has some low down dirty funk, pure funk, uncut funk. Funk it up now cause, \\""Can't No Body Do Me Like Jesus, Can't No Body Do Me Like Jesus.\\"" I Probly can say more, but I think you can understand and jam on this UNCUTFUNK. \\""PEACE BE STILL BROTHERS AND SISTERS.\\"" These worlds is from joyfull noise, loving the Bootsy Sound.

1265,4,"Recently, I have been on a \\""revisiting streak\\"" so to speak.  I've recently been picking up CDs that I've missed purchasing and listening to and etc... over the past few years. I think so easily we forget music from the past whether it dates back to classical music or to music from the 1990s.  So many people are so quick to say \\""that's old, I was into that music last week\\"".  In my view, it important to embrace the whole spectrum of music. With that the end of my music spill, Maxwell's third album NOW is a masterpiece.<br /><br />Maxwell opens up another door of R&B with this album which began of course with his debut, MAXWELL'S URBAN HANG SUITE.  With that said, I personally appreciate the fact that Maxwell doesn't try to be a contemporary R&B artist with all the dance moves and the dance videos; he is a cut above those type artists because his music isn't clubby, but more sophisticated, hence his neo-soul categorization.  What is neo-soul-- it is contemporary artists trying to recaptivate the \\""sanctity\\"" of the soul music of their musical mentors.  Maxwell captivates this from the opening track til the end of the CD without faltering.<br /><br />With that said, one odd thing about the physical CD itself is the way that the first song \\""Get To Know Ya'\\"" is cut.  Track 1 is listed on the CD as the \\""Get To Know Ya'\\"" track however that track only features the acoustic guitar introduction of that song and then proceeds into track 2 (the actual song) with an accented bass guitar hit.  That isn't a big deal of course, but it is something that you don't see on the average CD.  But with that said, \\""Get To Know Ya'\\"" is a soulful opening track that doesn't ooze with the sexuality that many of today less sophisticated releases do.  This track embodies soul and embodies being sexy without being explicit, which is part of the draw of a singer like Maxwell. I'm not dissing contemporary R&B artists because I am a fan of the BEST of them, but this type of music is simply more sophisticated and more credible in certain aspects.<br /><br />\\""Lifetime\\"" is a beautiful ballad that is soulful enough for the adult contemporary crowd but also contemporary enough for young listeners who appreciate the sincerest of love songs.  Skipping ahead to my other favorites, \\""Changed\\"" is another lovely tune, but the showstopper is the incredible, chilling \\""For Lovers Only\\"" which is just a beautiful piece of R&B music.<br /><br />For the most part, Maxwell's NOW is a consistent album, even though you can't help but to choose your favorite tracks or what you consider the strongest track.  Also, the acoustic guitar, electric piano formula is changed up slightly with burst of electric guitar and etc... This album never grows boring and who cares if it was released in 2001? It is still a credible music creation that will hopefully be an R&B album that people remember. You only have to listen to see why this album went platinum.  4 Stars Maxwell. I hope R&B continues to bring neo-soul men and women to the table.isticated and more credible in certain aspects. <br /> <br />\\""Lifetime\\"" is a beautiful ballad that is soulful enough for the adult contemporary crowd but also contemporary enough for young listeners who appreciate the sincerest of love songs.

1266,5,"Read Claster's right on review.<br />Ingelbrecht understood the inner details of the opera , where most every conductor fails to grasp. Ingelbrecht no doubt heard Roger Desormiere many times conduct Pelleas and so had the finest tecaher.<br />Though my first choice in Pelleas is the 1941 Desormiere recording, this 1960 (yr. I believe) recording is very close in all the nuances in conducting and casting. Of course the sound is better than the 1941 Desormiere. Ingelbrecht gives very interesting notes to the scoring and intentions of Debussy.<br />The other works are well conducted as well as a bonus, however there I suggest Martinon. Still just for the Pelleas, the ticket is worth the price.<br />Of the 7 recordings of Pelleas I owned, only prefer to hear these 2 master recordings.<br />Yes Jacques Jansen here is the same legendary tenor as on the Desormiere,"
1267,5,"I've been a DJ in country bars for the last 15 years. When this CD came out, I had to have it. I figured it would be just for my personal enjoyment, but I found that these versions filled my dance floor. Pam Tillis' \\""Colors of the Wind\\"" is a crowd favorite and in my opinion she owns that song now. \\""Kiss the Girl\\"" by Little Texas is still a favorite for the County Line line dance."
1268,4,"I usually dont offer my opinion on an album until I have memorized every riff and nuance of every song, but my local paper The Jacksonville Times Union blasted The Strokes and dared to compare them with Nickleback (or Nickelback, whatever- whitetrash rock!) I live a television/magazine sheltered life. I dont hear hype on bands or watch the latest entertainment news. Its all fluff anyway. My opinion of the Strokes came from one song 6 years ago. That song was Hard to Explain, literally.. That song blew me away because at the time rock was heading in a direction that was stagnate at best.. You had all these wanna-be Nirvanas, Pearl Jams mixed with rap-rock bands that have obviously not lasted too long.. I got into some of them, but to a level where I would never travel a great distance to watch them play.. The Strokes snapped me out of my daze and got me interested in Rock again.. Then along came Jet, Franz, The White Stripes and a few others.. This created an awesome time for Rock.. They were revitalizing Rock and doing so with a sound that resembled ours and our parents Rock music, but with a modern sound.. Doesnt this sound like what automakers are doing with the cars? Bringing back the older looking models with modern twists! Its cleverly perfect and gets the old 4-chambered muscle pumping again! To me this all started with The Strokes.. I have the unfortunate luck of living in a Redneck Big City where unfortunately groups like Nickleback get more airplay than these retro-modern groups so of course the reviewers are going to slam anything different.. When it comes to musical taste Jacksonville is still riding at the back of the bus (hush that fuss)! At least one person in this hick-swamp has some good taste and here is my opinion of First Impressions... I would rate (and should do a review) the first CD a 5 just for standoutishness (yes I make up my own words here).. The 2nd CD would get a 4, but a weak 4 just because they didnt do anything special other than theneat electroguitar sounds and fell victim to that Sophmore album curse that everyone (including The Beatles) has fell in to... This CD is a strong 4.. It is different, exploratory, and fun to listen to. The songs grow on you and its not torture to try out. Razorblade is pretty pop sounding and I foresee it being the next single and it rightly deserves to be. Its a good made-for-radio song.. My favorite is the IZE one.. The lyrics are awesome and the tempo changes are so sweet that you will anticipate them every time with glee! There are 2 songs on the CD that I need more time to appreciate, but thats not bad at all. A CD surpasses my expectations when there are at least 3 songs better than the first single and I count 5 that are better for sure and 5 more that are right behind it. You should pick this CD up just for the craftsmanship of the music as the boys are really getting their stuff together and producing some fine melodies. Where I knock points is for Jules... I like how he is experimenting and im actually a fan of his voice, but I dont think he gave it his all with some of the songs and there are some drops in fascination. I do however love his song about how hates everyone.. I think we have all hated everyone at some point or another and drinking just makes it worse in the end.. Anyhow I can only hope that Jacksonville will be the city to get Vapori-"
1269,1,Ok I am not in agreence with most of the reviews here. I can't believe this was an actual Robert Plant approved release! The songs are weak from beginning to end no matter their history. I've been a fan of Plants solo work for the most part. I have not been a fan of his outtings with Jimmy Page as they are boring droing affairs as is this $15.00 coaster. I was hoping the he got all those weird noises and rythems out of his system while playing with Page. Alas he has not at all... This album is not in anyway comparible to his solo history. The man sounds old and tired on every vocal. He might sound believable in his delivery but still that cannot sell the music he's putting forth. Production quality is decent as to be expected from Plant but I keep harping about the songs and they are the weakness of this album. If your a fan of vanilla folk music with african/indian instruments then great your in for a treat. If you want to hear the man rock or croon look elsewhere.
1270,1,"The original album, left alone, is 5 stats. This sound like crap with the new mix. It's really just low-level LA rock musicians that are willing to take a couple bucks for a day in the studio. <br />Sharon has really hit a new all-time low with ruining one of the most classic heavy metal albums ever made."
1271,5,"Fine Velvet Underground tribute album. Well known Velvet songs recorded by excellent bands. This is the first of three volumes \\""Heaven And Hell\\"".

The first song was good....her voice sounded great, by the time i got to I only have eyes for you??  i thought what happended!!  that song seemed sooo off key!! <br />what i do want and know i will love it the CD Reflections. she is too good to be following Rod in his pursuit of whatever it is. <br />This CD was just not   \\""the stuff that dreams are made of\\""!"

1275,4,"A review from Mark Gensman (Ground Zero Sound) written for the 800+ member Nwbluegrass Yahoogroup:<br /><br />I got this CD in today and rather than take my normal sweet time, I decided to spend some time with it this afternoon.<br /><br />First off, for you old timey, traditional bluegrass lovers. This is your CD. Even though there are several original cuts on the disc, the flavor is most certainly high up in the mountains, sitting on a porch or stomping your feet at a Saturday night get together in the barn.<br /><br />The band is:<br /><br />Patrick Walsh on upright bass<br /><br />Jamie Dawson on mandolin<br /><br />Lynda Wittig on guitar<br /><br />Kyra Moore on banjo<br /><br />Matt Hooper on fiddle<br /><br />Kickin Grass is a group that started out backing a cloggers group and has since taken off on their own to great acclaim. They are from North Carolina and from the liner notes are getting popular in the festival circuit. I can see why they would be a great live band.<br /><br />The CD appears to be a representation of how the band really sounds. But that brings up my only complaint and it really has nothing to do with the band. The overall tone and volume of the vocals was at times shrill and frequently distorted. If it was a case where the instruments were also distorted, I would think I got a bad CD, but the instruments were warm and present, while the vocals were not mixed or mastered properly at all and the volume of the vocals was uneven throughout the CD.<br /><br />That said, as long as you play this CD at fairly low volume, the sonic problems may not be noticable..but about the band..<br /><br />Really nice arrangements, good pickers and lots of energy which is hard to do in a studio. Here is the breakdown:<br /><br />1. Left This Town - A nicely done original with a lot of traditional flavor. I really like the songs this band writes and they play with that barn dance energy that works well here.<br /><br />2. Life Is Not A Guarantee - A very well done original ballad with strong old timey flavor.<br /><br />3. Backroads - Another original. A great fiddle break and another up tempo bluegrass style romp.<br /><br />4. Jokers Wild - Nice instrumental. This tune gives me an idea of how good they must be live, since it sounds like they are playing the song like they always do it.<br /><br />5. Hello Trouble - Good bluegrass music with this uptempo spirited tune. Good fiddle break and nice tone on the instruments.<br /><br />6. Sparrow - Another original with good lead vocal part. The Banjo is very nicely recorded and is actually \\""warm\\"" if that isn't an oxymoron. The harmony vocals get quite shrill and a little distorted in spots. Great<br /><br />arrangement.<br /><br />7. Clinch Mountain Backstep - A well done traditional bluegrass tune. Very interesting doubled mandolin break that stands out from the other instrument breaks.<br /><br />8. Little Piece Of Cornbread - Another excellent original written by Lynda Wittig. Very interesting mix with the vocals way behind the instruments and the words hard to discern at times. The instrument breaks are quite a bit louder than the lead vocal which is interesting at best.<br /><br />9. Fire On The Mountain - This reminds me of a Neil Young ballad. Very tasty instrument backing and the breaks are really well done. The lead vocal is slightly distorted but I could see Neil Young doing this song.<br /><br />10. Morning Train - Yet another original from Lynda Wittig. I must admit I am very impressed with the way this lady writes songs. They are very well crafted. This song sounds like a traditional Appalachian Mountain porch ballad with great harmony. The vocals are really, really loud and slightly<br /><br />distorted (again) and uneven, but that does not mean the band didn't sing a great song.<br /><br />11. Troubled Life - An original bluegrass style gospel song. Good harmonies but that dreaded distortion shows up again on certain parts of the lead vocal.<br /><br />12. Black Mountain Flag - Traditional tune done well. The instrumental songs are well mixed, with good balance and nice tone for all the instruments.<br /><br />All in all, a good band for those who prefer traditional bluegrass with old timey flavor and high lonesome vocals.<br /><br />I would enjoy this band live, and I only wish more attention would have been given to the production.<br /><br />The CD was produced by Steve Dilling of IIIrd Tyme Out and recorded at West Station Records. (Mark Gensman, Ground Zero Sound). Black Mountain Flag - Traditional tune done well.

1276,5,"Colombian temptress Shakira had better luck cracking the English-language market than her similarly alluring Mexican counterpart Thalia, whose self-titled American debut from 2003 didn't perform to commercial expectations. Smartly, Thalia's 2005 follow-up EL SEXTO SENTIDO pulls back considerably on the crossover attempts, and is a better introduction to the singer's charms. Sung entirely in Spanish (barring English-language remixes of three songs, \\""You Know He Never Loved You,\\"" \\""Seduction\\"" and \\""A Dream For Two\\""), EL SEXTO SENTIDO is a straightforward Latin pop/rock album, from the flirty bubblegum of \\""24,000 Besos\\"" and \\""No Puedo Vivir Sin Ti\\"" to the hyper-dramatic ballads \\""Loca\\"" and \\""Un Alma Sentenciada.\\"" The best tracks, however, are the ones on which Thalia and her producers take some cues from the Rock en Espanol scene, including the tough-sounding and terrifically catchy first single \\""Amar Sin Ser Amada\\"" (the original and superior version of \\""You Know He Never Loved You\\"") and the Kylie Minogue-like dance-pop of \\""Empezar de O.\\"" <br />"
1277,5,"This is an awesome Box Set. The remaster edition itself is worth the waiting. I can't just wait until Columbia decides to release the whole Springsteen discography on remaster editions, as it has been done with Dylan.<br /><br />Well, besides the remaster edition, that Box Set comes with 2 great additions. The first is the documentary, which is excellent. It's nice to see Mike Appel today talking about the recording of his last work with Bruce. You get to see Bruce driving around Freehold and Asbury Park, showing us the house where he composed the whole album on the piano. Some parts of the documentary are Bruce explaining the meaning of the songs (a little bit like what he did on the Storytellers VH1 TV Show). All the members of the band, including Ernest \\""Boom\\"" Carter and David Sancious (and Lofgren and Scialfa, who I don't think should be there) give us their opinions and experiences on recording the album. Iovine and Landau appear as well on the documentary. Also, as an extra, the first DVD comes with a mini Live show: 3 songs from a 1973 concert. The sound is excellent, and we got the chance to see Vinny Lopez on drums with the first E Street Band.<br /><br />The second addition is the London Hammersmith Odeon concert from 1972. I had the chance to see a preview on the Glory Days Symposium in New Jersey (September 2005) and we were all shocked by the quality of the sound and the more than just ok image quality. I just watched the whole concert today on my Home Theatre System and the experience was so thrilling I couldn't believe what I was watching. The whole show is just awesome, with the E Street Band kicking asses here and there. It is a great opportunity to see the band back in the early 70's, again, with a great sound and a brilliant set list.<br /><br />I don't care about the box, or the CD sleeves. I care about the music, and the music is just AWESOME. Of course everything can be done better, but the music, and the movies can't get better. So let's be fair and give this CD what it deserves, which is nothing less than 5 stars. Everybody should own this BOX SET in his/her collection, being Born to Run one of the TOP 10 Best Rock Records ever.his CD what it deserves, which is nothing less than 5 stars.

1278,3,"The Dolls is a collaboration between three artists who have no business finding enough time to work together and put out an album. In the past year or so, Antye Greie has released Explode with Vladislav Delay, as well as Before The Libretto as a member of the Lappetites. Vladislav Delay has not only collaborated with Greie on the aforementioned release, but put out The Four Quarters under his own name. Oh yeah, and Craig Armstrong is a constantly-working composer who has released albums under his own name, as well as worked with artists ranging from Madonna to U2 and Massive Attack, as well as doing soundtrack work for films like Moulin Rouge (among others).<br /><br />  Interestingly enough, The Dolls sounds almost exactly as one might imagine it to sound given the three artists involved. Warm, lush piano and string work is layered over the top of crisp, sometimes dub-influenced programming while glitchy sprays burst over it at times. Oh yeah, and Greie adds her half-spoken, half-sung vocals (which seem to be getting increasingly better with each release she works on). In fact, the album opener of \\""Martini Never Dies\\"" is almost straightforward enough to find itself on an album by Armstrong himself, with slick, dry cracking beats and a wobbly bassline rumbling under minimal piano phrases and some crooning by Greie that sounds almost freestyle at times. \\""White Dove\\"" chugs out alternating beat patterns under more warm piano and vocals, while frantic bursts of electronics shuffle on the outskirts.<br /><br />  On the album (and group) titled \\""The Dolls,\\"" the group turn in what is basically the theme song from the collaboration as glitch dub beats roll underneath some great interplay between Greie and the ivory tickling of Armstrong. Fortunately, not every single track on the album follows the same pattern as all of the aforementioned tracks, as \\""Night Active\\"" busts out with a more dancey beat and nary a piano or string to be found while \\""Choices\\"" rumbles with some poppy electro-krunk and \\""Motor City\\"" is 4/4 banging with a wobbled-out twist (and some almost doo-wop vocals from Greie). Fans of Armstrong may find The Dolls a bit too strange to digest on first sitting, but those looking for even more unique work from Greie and Delay will find that the collaborative trio (who are all obviously as prolific as hell) has more than enough interesting elements to make it a worthwhile purchase.<br /><br />(from almost cool music reviews)th some poppy electro-krunk and \\""Motor City\\"" is 4/4 banging with a wobbled-out twist (and some almost doo-wop vocals from Greie).

1279,5,"Earth, Wind & Fire without doubt is the best R&B band to ever grace the scene. EWF returns with a vengance with stellar production that today's youth can appericate only if they HEAR music and don't listen to.contemporary R&B and hip-hop, opting for a sharp, polished production that fits right in on urban radio, while still staying true to the pan-global grooves and complex, technically advanced playing on which the group built its reputation. A host of guest stars--nearly all of whom are from an up-and-coming generation of soul--appear here. Black Eyed Peas' Will. I. Am. co-writes and performs on the opener \\""Lovely People,\\"" while Outkast's Big Boi steps up to the mic on \\""This Is How I Feel.\\"" The sensual crooner Brian McKnight lends his pipes to the ballad \\""To You,\\"" and even Kenny G. puts in an appearance on a saxophone-based instrumental.

1280,3,"Smiley Smile simply is the moment when the Beach Boys died. It maybe impossible to imagine now, but up to 1966 the Beach Boys were as respected as artists as the Beatles. Smiley Smile is a rushed album, with practically no instrumentation whatsoever and many under-rehearsed vocals, except for Good Vibrations and Heroes and Villians. If Capitol ever releases a  Smile box set as they promised, Smiley Smile will be then send to oblivion, in the hall of shame where it belongs. The world never took the beach boys seriously after that. Wild Honey is actually a very good album, not better than Pet Sounds or Smile, but different than anything they ever did before. Some of the songs and arrangements are totally Brian Wilson at his best. Some of the 'soul' vocals I find difficult to digest and I miss the Beach boys blend on the songs. The extra tracks on the album are ESSENTIAL to any serious beach boys fan, so, if you are, you need this album."

1285,1,well i bought dis cd only because it was da queen B ! but sadly i wanted my money back! i was disapointed with this project.... dis is no Notorious KIM and no where near HARDCORE or her last cd...to me it sounds like it has to muc filler material (weak songs) i like her style .. i know she dont got no mad flow or rare production skills but she always put out catchy good material not here unfortuantely y is she trying to sound extra hard on her first single? she acts so delicate and lady like and where did dis come from (leave da bk songs to foxy) i only enjoyed we dont give a F____ with twista (go chitown Go sox!) and gimme that da rest of the album is weak i do not understand why everyone is feeling dis boring cd i swear dis is a very dull cd maybe when she gets out she makes a real comeback.. but not reccomended i sell it to anyone for 3 dollars !

1287,5,"If I didn't admit I wasn't disappointed after first picking up this album, I would be lying.  I was expecting, like most everyone else, another \\""Leave a Whisper\\"".  This is not Leave a Whisper by a long shot, but the songs are intriguing and a different side of Shinedown.  It took me a few listens, but I think that this album will be in my CD changer for a long time for the mere fact that the more I listen, the more I enjoy it.  Some albums you play to death once you get them, and in about six months' time you're ready to trade it in.   <br /> <br />For the people who are pi**ed that this wasn't Leave A Whisper II, I give you Staind and Papa Roach, two examples of bands who never really left their style and have just become boring.  For those of you who have listened to the album and gave it a chance, I give you Zakk Wylde and the voluminous projects he has completed.  Most retain the brutality he is known for, but a couple of album and side projects really present a different side.  I think this is Shinedown's 'different side' and fully expect another crushing album when project #3 is due.   <br /> <br />The album sort of reminds me of Audioslave, and I wouldn't be surprised if they toured together at some point in their careers.  Some people may knock it, but I think they pull it off pretty good.  The music is quite good, and something to pull out when you just want to kick back and relax."
1288,5,"This is my favorite CD of all time.  I would try to compare it to something, but there is none that I can think of that would do it justice.  Anthony Greene's vocals are high and amazing, contrasting with his screams which send chills down your spine.  The musical talent behind him is more than enough to back this disc up.  The drums, by ex-Slayer drum technician Pat McGrath, are the best I have ever heard.  Buy this CD now, because Saosin will never produce another album this intense or skillful again.  The punch packed in these five tracks outdo any other full-length."

1290,3,"Well, I have been a fan for a while and now i am starting to lose the faith. <br /> <br />No matter how many people hated Bon Jovi, they were different, they were special but if you listen to this album, you won't be able to tell the difference between Bon Jovi, or Vertical Horizon, any other moderate paced \\""Rockers\\"" <br /> <br />This is a decent album but not a Rock Album, that is the only problem with this album, if you have heard the song \\""Unbreakable\\"" you will realise that BJ sound not very different from the Backstreet Boys' \\""backsteet's back\\"" <br /> <br />Well, i thought a rock album was long due, and this one would be filled with long guitar solos, booming drums, i don't care bout the lyrics because we ain't listening to a sermon, if the music is great, the song becomes great in spite of the lyrics (eg. Little Richard), but not, this isn't as if it has come from guys who have been playing for over 20 years <br /> <br />I am happy that it has done well in the charts and that many people like this album, i hope it does well. But i also hope that Bon Jovi not be afraid to make use of the guitars and the drums, its time they start re-establishing their position in the rock kingdom, otherwise they will be forgotten. <br /> <br />While alice cooper and manowar are coming out with heavier material, staying true to Rock and helping it survive in the present day hip-hop and rap crap, i think bon jovi isn't helping rock, unless they get a few more anthems like Keep the Faith, and kick ass songs like Dry County, Bon jovi will go down in history as Popstars not Rockstars"
1291,4,"the music of The Fall is both engaging and off-putting...equal parts clever and brilliant mixed with the confounding and annoying. the casual fan of punk or post rock will probably be confused. and that my friends, may be the point. or maybe not. you decide. take a listen. Dragnet is a close second or third to being my favorite record by this band."
1292,5,"Whoa!  I must say after the first three songs you can't help but to become overwhelmed with emotion.  God called Kirk Franklin for such a time as this...This CD is beyond excellent.  It touches the heart and soul of what Gospel music is suppose to be about...reaching out to the unreachable, touching and changing lives, and calling the lost to have relationship with the Savior.  Go get this CD..."
1293,1,"I thought this girl was Australian, but I guess I was wrong because she sounds Irish or something.  Anyway, I thought this would be better than it was and it's not really my style of music.  It's too boring and slow and no passion or soul is here.  Plus, the twang she uses is not native of Australia.  What gives?  Anyway, I'm going to have to sell this one back as it's too boring and sleep inducing.  I think I'll stick to Soul and RnB.  Much more passion in that style of music and they don't pretend to be something they aren't."
1294,4,"For those who see Ray J on BET he comes of a lil corny, but don't sleep on this album. I heard mix reviews about his other albums and truthfully the title Raydiation is kind of lame. But after I heard One Wish i decided to pick this album up. Now Ray J Doesn't have a strongest voice but he does have good enough production and writing on this album to make up for that. The low points on this album are (Quit Hatin', Sexy, and Unbelievable). Other than that the album is solid."
1295,2,"This 80s trio's most well-known for what's the strongest song on this nineteen-track compilation of their complete works, \\""There Is No Depression in New Zealand.\\"" This muscular, post-punk tune benefits from an assaultive base, a wry delivery of an ironic lyric, and a steady propulsion. The rest of the tracks, however, show a steady slog through unvarying takes on XTC's tribal rhythms, Magazine's claustrophobic ennui, and the Talking Heads' lighter global-light tunes with nods to reggaeish and funky beats. None of this has worn particularly well.<br /><br />The album seems to never end, and the similar sludgy pace of most of the songs weighs down whatever clever insights the lyrics might contain. The band is accomplished at what they do, and the vocal and bass-playing abilities sound confident, but there's nothing that makes this band stand out from any other group elsewhere in the early 80s, unfortunately. For completists of NZ rock only, alas."
1296,3,"Still very good but it seems that Jack spent a lot of his musical and lyrical ingenuity on the first album and he starts to run out of ideas... I mean, not that there were too many ideas to begin with. After all, his is pure and simply music of relaxation, surfing abandon, get-mellow-and-chill-out kinda stuff and one simply shouldn't expect too much. Still a very worthy album and I enjoyed several songs very much. Favorites - \\""The Horizon Has Been Defeated\\"", \\""Holes To Heaven\\"" are superb and a couple of others are really good."
1297,4,"Although a lot of this CD has songs that deal with sadness, loneliness, anger and bitterness(Chaos), the arrangements are built with interesting instruments, unexpected chord changes, close harmonies and varied tempos(Creation).  Fine Line is a good, uptempo pop tune, heavy with piano.  Jenny Wren has great guitar at the start, then a drum taps in, followed by a beautiful and haunting reed instrument(a duduk).  Promise To You Girl displays some great harmonies in the style of Queen more than Wings and the lyrics are more optimistic and upbeat here.      If we must compare any of this sound to the Beatles there is an obvious song, English Tea.  Kind of like a Martha My Dear or any of the Rutles loving parodies.    This Never Happened Before has a short running bass line that puts you in the mind of You Never Give Me Your Money from Abbey Road.  Finally, there is a hidden track that has an assortment of quirky honking horn sounds and tape loops in the style of Strawberry Fields. You can find a new sound each time you listen and it is a very pleasing CD performed virtually all by Paul. A well crafted CD."
1298,3,"Kanye West drops another good album, that's for sure.  But it's way overrated.  Don't get me wrong, the album is a lot of fun but there are a lot of other albums that also dropped this year and are way better than  \\""Late Registration\\"".  With his first album Kanye West already proved that he's creative when it comes to making beats and delivering fresh lyrics.  and so does he shine on \\""late registration\\"". especially \\""crack music\\"", \\""drive slow\\"" and \\""gold digger\\"" are really dope tracks.  these are the highlights of \\""late registration\\"".  so would i recommend this album? yes! but dont expect too much.  its a enjoyable record not more not less.  and to everybody that is interested in the samples used by kanye west i recommend.  [...]"
1299,5,"Although \\""Three For Love\\"" wasn't as commercially successful as the 1982 mega hit \\""Friends\\"", it's still one of my favourite Shalamar albums.  It's a great selection of feel-good songs that puts a smile on my face every time I listen to them. <br /> <br />The album opens with the catchy grooves of \\""Full Of Fire\\"", which was co-written by Jody Watley.  I love the horn section and the orchestral arrangement that blended with the thumping R&B rhythm.  \\""Attention To My Baby\\"" is another cracker of a dance track. <br /> <br />Shalamar proved their versatility by switching from solid dance tunes to stellar ballads with ease.  \\""Somewhere There's A Love\\"" is a good ballad, but it was overshadowed by \\""This Is For The Lover In You\\"" (co-written by Howard Hewett) which is a gem of a ballad.  I couldn't believe it when Howard, Jody and Jeffrey reunited and joined Babyface for the remake in 1996 - it reached #12 on the UK pop charts.  How about another reunion, guys?  Babyface is up for it! <br /> <br />My favourite track on the album wasn't released as a single (not in the UK, anyway) - \\""Some Things Never Change\\"".  This is such a catchy upbeat song with the hallmarked solid beat that we all love.  It also features great vocal lead performances by Jody and Howard.  The only UK hit from the album was the classic \\""Make That Move\\"" - it reached #30 on the pop charts and remained in the charts for 10 weeks. <br /> <br />Jeffrey took the lead on the funky \\""Pop Along Kid\\"" that extolled the virtues of body popping/moon walking some 2 years before Michael Jackson's 'introduction' at the Motown 25 concert! <br /> <br />This is a cracking, but underrated album that's crammed with superb songs.  Those were the days! <br /> <br />"

1301,2,"On his Greatest Hits, I was expecting to get a clean CD of songs that were taken from the original masters or reel-to-reels, but the first 9 songs were recorded off of vinyl. <br /> <br />I gave this CD 2 Stars because you can hear all of the snap, crackle, and pops that expect to hear on old records.  If this might be a concern of yours, then buyer(s) beware..."
1302,4,"Even if you don't speak Spanish like myself, you'll enjoy this album.  At first listen to kick-off single \\""La Tortura\\"", I was immediately drawn into the raw emotion of ex-lovers that transcends language.  Throughout the album, Shakira continues to put you in touch with her feelings, melding her heartfelt lyrics with latin, pop, and new wave beats.  And for an addded bonus, there is not one but two remixes of \\""La Tortura\\""; the 'shaketon' mix as last track on disc 1, and 'reggaeton' mix on disc 2.  Now if there were only a club mix..."
1303,5,"We just caught this group in concert the other night and they are AWESOME!! (I was also lucky enough to get their autographs). I like EVERY song on this CD.

1304,5,"Kiki's done it again!  The hot remixes to a hot album.  If you're a phanatic, she won't let you down.  Just enough to hold me until the next release."
1305,5,"Sufjan's latest album vacillates musically from soul-searching folk tunes to big, complex, multi-layered production numbers that would be perfectly comfortable in a broadway show.  It is an entralling emotional journey that takes us to the depths of Sufjan's darkest moral nadirs to his most triumphant and hopeful epiphanies.<br /><br />Never before has an album struck me as being such a complete statement about the human condition.  Perhaps it is Sufjan's Christian faith (which is slightly less of a focus on this album than on the two previous albums) that allows him to hold such an odd combination of despair and distress supplemented by boundless hope for the future.  Take this as a lesson for the bland musical artists who market themselves to the evangelical Christian crowd, Sufjan's music is what you can do when you simply let your faith inform and inspire the music rather than just use the music as a cheap evangelization tool.  (I should be sure to say that despite the obvious Christian influence, this is not preachy music and it can be -- and is -- enjoyed by persons of all faiths and no faith at all.)<br /><br />The songs are all loosely based on historical and geographical trivia of the state of Illinois.  As with his previous album \\""Michigan\\"", Sufjan uses these structures as a jumping-off point for a more complex exploration of the human experience.<br /><br />Musically, Sufjan employs a variety of styles.  Some of the tracks are relatively simple acoustic folk arrangements.  Other tracks, such as \\""Come on Feel the Illinoise\\"", \\""Chicago\\"", and the powerful almost-finale \\""The Tallest Man, the Broadest Shoulders\\"", exhibit compexity in layered arrangements supported by orchestra and horns and a full chorus.  Syncopated rhythms and uncommon time signatures are employed to their fullest.<br /><br />The album cannot be described adequately in words, because so much of its power is in its undeniably magnificent emotional impact.  It is pure beauty.  It is not overstatement to say that it will surely be considered a candidate for greatest album of 2005, and I believe it may be the greatest album of the decade thus far.overstatement to say that it will surely be considered a candidate for greatest album of 2005, and I believe it may be the greatest album of the decade thus far."
1306,1,"OK first of all, I am a HUGE clapton fan. I have most of the records, seen him a ton of times and was excited when this CD came in the mail. After listening half way thru I was very upset.  The music is GARBAGE. I mean how can you go from the Cream Reunion and Sessions for Robert J to this Smooth Jazz pile of rubble.  Not even guest shots from Winwood and Robert Randolph can help this thing out. Clapton scatting isn't my idea of a good idea. <br /> <br />I will say \\""Revolution\\"" is a great song, if the whole record had more of that vibe it would have been a good addition. In my opinion this is worse than Pligrim. <br /> <br />Thanks to simon climie for screwing up clapton's career."
1307,5,"I am the type of person who rarely buys music CD.. like many I download them.... and so I did for Massari...and since I liked all of the songs.. I decided to buy the cd,, to support him. his music is very nice and pleasant to ear ..can't go wrong with this cd.. very nice songs"
1308,1,"Just not one of my favorite steely dan cd's, & I think I have about everything they've put out"
1309,5,"The Peter Wolf who worked with JS on this CD is NOT the same guy from the J. Geils Band. Come on people, haven't you figured that out already? It's only been 21 years since this came out."
1310,5,"All I will say is that \\""Say Hello 2 Heaven\\"" Is the single greatest vocal perfomance in the history of rock. When you hear Chris Cornell blast out with shaddering emotion on this track, you will be blown away, just like I was. Eddie Vedder, another great singer, also appears throughout the album, adding beutiful harmony. \\""Say Hello 2 Heaven\\"" is indeed the single best vocal performance in the history of rock, and is reason alone to purchase this CD. Overall, most of the songs are good, and the album is one of the most underrated of all time."
1311,1,"We bought this because we were talking about records we knew from college, and while we remembered enjoying it, we couldn't really remember any of the music. Now the music and lyrics seem sophomoric, embarrassing,  and not really worth listening to again."
1312,3,"Let's face it, fans of the artist: While NIN has a lot of worthy material, the \\""Pretty Hate Machine\\"" singles were only made for completists. Where others sometimes had authentic B-sides/covers, and actual interesting remixes, this was from a time when \\""interesting\\"" and \\""remix\\"" were an oxymoron. <br /> <br />I'm not a big fan of remixes, and I'll admit that the majority of the rest of the disc is very average, especially coming from NIN. \\""Get Down Make Love\\"" raises the thing up a star. It's a pretty good cover of Queen that does not try to ape Queen. This song is the only thing that most people usually mention on the single, too. There are also three uninteresting remixes of \\""Sin\\"", but I sort of like that \\""dub\\"" mix. It's nice to think of \\""Sin\\"" as a dub song. I am not a purist who hates this song being turned into a dance song, as I think it could have been worse. But if you must buy a single from this era, I must direct you to \\""Head Like a Hole\\"". \\""The Downward Spiral\\"" era was the only real time when the singles were worth owning, save the occasional exception. Besides, if you bought it, well... you bought it and it's there for something. And having just 4 tracks cannot be too bad."
1313,5,"I love Duran Duran and have for since '84 when I was a mere teenybopper. This album is certainly one of their best and a classic, truly timeless.

1314,4,"What the f*** do you all think your talking about!!?! Lil Kim has good music!!! What the f*** do you think hardcore rap is? why would they make the \\""Hardcore Rap\\"" category? BECAUSE ALOT OF PEOPLE LIKE HARDCORE RAP! and obviously you are all way to acustomed to all those goody artists like Jessica Simpson. Go and listen to your light pop s*** and leave Lil Kim alone. There are plenty of fans for lil kim. I am sure with all her albums going platnum and better people like her. So stay the f*** away from her music if you dont knwo what your listening to! <br /> <br />Though this isnt her BEST album it is still a very decent album! THere are plenty of good songs on this album and it is a great example of female hardcore rap. I would recommend this but personally I like La Bella Mafia more and Hardcore less. <br /> <br />I cant wait til the Nakad Truth! You know where the first place I will be when I wake up at 9 is? Bestbuy buying her album the first day it comes out. Lil Kim doesnt deserve to go to Jail and I will miss her. Just watch her get out in like 5 months on parole or good behaviour or whatever else there is to get out early. Prison isnt going to ruin her career. When she gets out she will be better then ever and continue to rap. I will be waiting for that day when her next album after the nakad truth comes out in 2-3 years. I will continue to support her. <br /> <br />As quoted from the worlds famous Queen Bee Lil Kim \\""Shut Up Bitchs!\\"""
1315,4,"Patti needs to be slapped...for her BRILLIANCE! <br /> <br />Though I am a devoted Patti fan, I have never been afraid to say when Patti has \\""missed the mark.\\"" In my opinion, until \\""Classic Moments,\\"" Patti had not released a true Patti CD since \\""Gems\\"" in 1994. Flame, When A Woman Loves and even Timeless Journey seemed  <br />too synthetic and robbed the public of the true classic material that Patti is capable of. <br /> <br />That being said, though Classic Moments has a few missteps, this is truly a cd that I believe is a feather in the cap of Ms. LaBelle. I commend her for doing the unexpected...she came out with songs that she HAS NOT sang on past tours.  She came out with songs that we haven't heard on her voice and showed that she can still put her mark on them without leaving the songs devoid of their original magic.  Moreover, Patti tackles songs that don't make her come off as being \\""too old\\"" or \\""outdated.\\"" Instead, Patti comes off as seasoned, vibrant, and in the process of reaching new milestones in her career. <br /> <br />The best performance undoubtedly on this album is \\""You're Gonna Make Me Love Somebody Else,\\"" followed by my personal favorites \\""Love Ballad,\\"" \\""Land of the Living,\\"" and \\""I'll Stand by You.\\"" <br /> <br />I'll admit, upon first listen, I wasn't too thrilled with the album because I kept thinking of other songs that I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED Patti to sing. However, after seeing Patti at a meet and great in Chicago where she discussed the album, she said that all these songs meant so much to her and that gave the album new meaning. These were songs that Patti loved and appreciated. <br /> <br />In short, this album is a message from Patti to her fans where she bares her soul.  She recognizes that there are some songs that the public won't like but that's not of her concern...what's important is that people understand that these songs are an expression of her being and her soul. Sing on Patti."
1316,5,"Substance shows New Order at their most edgy, experimental, and inventive stage.  The first two covers all their greatest songs never before captured on LP, and disc two mainly covers their heavily Joy Division inspired b-sides.  What great tunage is to be had here.  This album ups the ante for everything, it features extended, altered, and all around improved versions of numerous songs including Temptation, The Perfect Kiss, and Bizarre Love Triangle (which was pretty much butchered on Brotherhood).  The full length version of The Perfect Kiss is one of the greatest experiments ever captured on a recording, sounding almost completely improvised and practiced to perfection at the same time.  It also features the greatest combination of cowbell, bongos, and bass known to man.  Disc one also features the highly underrated Everything's Gone Green and Thieves Like Us (probably featuring Bernard at his best as far as vocals are concerned.  Disc one pretty much embodies the spirit of dance clubs in the 80's with Blue Monday, Confusion, and Shellshock.  The whole thing is as bass and keyboard heavy as hell.  What else can I say? One word, Temptation, greatest New Order track ever recorded.  This may be the most angst heavy dance track ever written, and probably shows Bernard at his lyrical hayday. <br /> <br />Disc two drops the whole dark, dancefloor mania that the first disc embodies and moves to the claustrophobic, brooding, Divisionesque, experimental b-sides, plus a few remixes thrown in for good measure.  The best stuff to be had here is the one-two punch of Cries & Whispers and Hurt.  The harmonium work in Hurt is most decidedly sweet.  Kiss of Death, a remix of Perfect Kiss, shows that the best remixers for New Order are themselves, as they strip most of the narrative lyrics laden in the original and  up the ante on the synths, and makes the track even better dancefloor material.  Shame of the Nation is a bit of misfire on this disc, probably due to the fact that the original track itself wasn't much to write home about.  Lonesome Tonight, however, features Bernard crooning at his best, and 1963 tells a great story that may or may not have to do with the shooting of JFK.  Why they decided not to stick some of these extraordinary b-sides on a proper LP is anyone's guess, but maybe it's for the better as it resulted in the creation of the one of the greatest double disc albums ever."
1317,5,"I absolutely adore Keith Urban!  He is an unbelievably talented singer and songwriter.  I would definetely recomend this album to anyone who likes country music, and everyone who doesn't!!"
1318,5,"I love this music.  I wonder sometimes if I'm not a member of a some club whose musical tastes are intentionally being completed ignored. <br /> <br />Thank you, Rod, thank you."
1319,5,"For all you people out there who liked the music from the movie, get this soundtrack!  It is full of cool songs.  It remains pretty heavy throughout, but it also has a heavenly moment courtesy of Orbital.  Definitely worth it.  Also, if you like this soundtrack, check out Mortal Kombat More Kombat and Mortal Kombat Annihilation.  They are all just as good."
1320,5,I love all the songs included in this cd. The remix is fantastic. It is a must have if you like trance music.
1321,5,"Having had the record album many years ago, I was happy to get the CD. It is a wonderful CD by a prolific and talented songwriter who just happens to be a most expressive singer. Who better to sing her songs.<br /><br />Without a doubt, the best track on the CD is \\""Will You Love Me Tomorrow\\"". Not only is the music terrific and the singing expressive, the lyrics to this song are pure poetry. \\""It's Too Late\\"", \\""You've Got a Friend\\"", and \\""Tapestry\\"" are some of the other golden tracks on this CD.<br /><br />There is not, however, one bad track on this CD, and there are not too many CDs about which one may say this. The CD liner also includes the lyrics to the songs on it. It is definitely a CD without which no music library should be."
1322,4,"I just bought Anna's CD, after becoming obsessed with the first single. I am enjoying it, but it isn't quite what I had hoped for. I didn't know what to expect, but I've been pleased even if it doesn't have many \\""turn-it-up\\"" kind of songs on the CD. Still a good buy that I'm not regretting, and I'm already singing along with a lot of the songs. (I can't stand songs where you can't tell what the person is saying.) One of the reviewers said Sarah Maclaughlan fans would appreciate this CD, and I agree - that's exactly who I would compare her to."
1323,4,"Yeah, thanks DRG. How nice to not have scratches, even though I dig the erotic smell of vinyl (oh face it, y'all do, too!) <br /> <br />I owned this score as a kid, growing up weird, and then staged a bizarre multimedia thing at Univ. of San Francisco in the mid-80s with a bald 6'5\\"" African American Alvin Ailey  male dancer in a strapless female white evening gown, with an orchid behind his ear dancing to \\""Lonely Girl - Main Theme\\"". He brought down the house with his interpretation of men's favorite images of women... the images of women that men fall in love with.  It brought down the house, they loved it, and thanks to the music, no one confused it with camp or drag. <br /> <br />HARLOW'S a very dated, very cool score, probably Hefti's best, and \\""Girl Talk\\"" is simply over the top in that bluesy mid-60s John Barry 'Petulia'style. Def worth the ten bucks!!! <br /> <br />thanks DRG!"
1324,1,"First, let me address the polarized political zealots. The US is neither the greatest country on earth nor a despotic Nazi dictatorship, but a first world country among many. The US government has provided questionable leadership as of late, but this does not make the average US citizen evil or a malefactor to the rest of the world. I really don't see how political views would make a difference on how you view the musical content of an album, anyways. <br /> <br />This album's musical content is no different from all the other nu-metal acts out there today. The mallcore has a slightly different flavor due to an unconventional vocalist and \\""provocative\\"" lyrics, but at the end of the day, it's the same quality and displays the same amount of originality. The riffs are downtuned for the effect of making the songs appear heavier and covering up the lack of riffing diversity. The lack of solos further drives this point home. Were you to remove the lyrics from any of these songs, you'd quickly realize that all the songs are comprised of arrangements of the same four barre chords. The basswork and drumming is no better, displaying a total lack of technical initiative. If MVT has convinced you that this sort of music is good, go for it. Otherwise, stay away."
1325,5,"One of the finest singles ever released, Classical Gas, is heard here in digital clarity.  It's extraordinary that it is so rarely heard these days and hopefully this CD will find it a new audience.  The remaining tracks are mostly songs and are a unique tribute to the style of the day.  Both lyrical and whimsical they pay tribute to an age that was both innocent, yet thought it was the height of \\""trendy\\"", and corny, yet thought itself profound."
1326,5,"Very underrated, this album never got the recognition it deserved...but AC/DC were never MTV Friendly, but still, a looked over album, AC/DC produced this album themselves, and sounds fine, great riffs, vocals ect, this was 1983, glam-Rock was getting big, and AC/DC never fed into that, could very well be the reason the mid-to-late 80s albums never got noticed, all tracks are good, but the best, are Rising Power, This House Is On Fire, Flick of The Switch, Nervous Shakedown, Guns For Hire, get this underrated gem."
1327,4,"Missy did it decent on this joint, this is probably the best overall cd she's dropped since the orignal, the mecca, SUPA DUPA FLY.  She switched it up on this one unlike past efforts, the production work is spread out... it's not a Timabaland-heavy project, so it doesnt have a lot of the original banger beats most Missy fan's would probably expect.... hence some bad reviews.... but all bias aside, the beats are still bananas... they're just less (in-your-face) than we're accustomed to in Missy's recent history.  The beats here are more groovey and relaxed, again somewhat similar to her debut, SUPA DUPA FLY, which was Missy at her best - a time when the beat was less at the forefront -(but still relevant)- than her lyrics and sick ad libs.  IRRESISTIBLE, LOSE CONTROL, ON AND ON, WE RUN THIS, TEARY EYED, CLICK CLACK, and BAD MAN are high lights of the cd. <br />i keep reading reviews mentioning MISS E. SO ADDICTIVE as if its the standard, the pinnacle.  Rookies need to stop reviewing cd's... go listen to SUPA DUPA FLY... from the BUS INTRO the cd jumps off lovely and MISS was at her best with blazing ad libs laced over ill timbaland beats."
1328,5,"This album is a compilation on the \\""lighter\\"" ,usic of the 20 Century Russian maaster Dmitri Shostakovitch. Most, if not all of this music was composed on commission from one or another soviet \\""cultural\\"" bureau dealing with variety entertainment. The music was used for popular dance programs, circuesses, musical theatre, etc. Why did the usuallky serious, solemn,  master accept such commissions?  In a word, to stay off the Gulag. Shostakovitch fell precipitously from favor with Stalin because of the form and content of his ooera \\""A Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk\\"".<br /><br />He felt threatened by the enmity of the paranoid Stalin (as did countless others) for the remainder of the dictator's lengthy reign. He felt (probably quite correctly) that he had to prove, by appearances at least, his commitment to Marxist/Stalinist notions of art and the masses again and again, hence his accptance of commissions for \\""popu;ar\\"" music.  What this album demonstrates, however, is, that whatever his conscious motivation was, Shostakovitch remained a dedicated composer with very high standards even in this \\""lighter\\"" area. The little pieces which make up the \\""Jazz Suites\\"" and \\""Ballet Suites\\"" are gems of humor and sentiment, often spiced (risking Stalin's ire) with subtle irony, and not-so subtle satire. I highly recomment this album for relief during or after a long session with Shostakovitch's sympronies."
1329,3,"Good point: almost 79 minutes. <br /> <br />Bad point: bad compilation - only one song from the classic album 'Among The Living'; no songs sung by Neil Turbin, the first singer."
1330,5,"If you own and love the two first albums, this new release from The Raveonettes might strike you as too calm during the first spin. But don't rush, \\""take a little time to get to know me\\"" says the first sentence of \\""Heartbreak stroll\\"" (on the previous cd \\""Chain gang of love\\""), so do that... <br />There are several great songs on this album (wich is particularely filled with ballads): The opener \\""The heavens\\"", \\""Seductress of bums\\"", \\""Ode to LA\\"" (Ronnie Spector helps on this one, and her voice is still as brightful as it was on \\""Be my baby\\""!) and the surfer \\""Sleepwalking\\"" are on the melancholic side. But then again you have \\""Love in a trashcan\\"" a song that shows how cool can The Raveonettes get... the cover of \\""My boyfriend's back\\"" is really good, and \\""Twilight\\""... The Raveonettes have done a Dance song!!!, and it's quite as catchy as Primal Scream's \\""Some velvet morning\\""!... we should start hearing some remixes of that song in short. <br />Yes you'll miss the furious melancholyc rock of \\""That great love sound\\"" on this album, but this one will get you higher in emotions... and don't worry, I'm sure these two will rock again very soon... <br />One last comment, I love the girl's voice... and she's quite easy on the eyes too..."
1331,5,"These two discs feature live-in-the-studio recordings made by The Beatles for BBC Radio between 1962 and 1965.   Over half of these 56 songs are covers, many of which were never officially released, and it's a real treat to have this often-bootlegged material available and generally sounding very good. And the lavish 46-page booklet features complete recording information, pictures, and essays by Derek Taylor and producer Kevin Howlett.    The Beatles do their best to live up to their happy-go-lucky images on a number of non-musical \\""soundbytes\\"", and Paul McCartney gets to sing a couple of too-cute pop songs, but the majority of this material is simply magnificent. John Lennon sings a tough rock n' roll-rendition of Ray Charles' \\""I Got A Woman\\"", McCartney rips loose on electrifying versions of \\""Lucille\\"" and \\""I Saw Her Standing There\\"", and George Harrison does a credible Chuck Berry on \\""Roll Over Beethoven\\"".  A couple of Arthur Alexander-covers are equally great, and Lennon performs a wonderfully tough, confident reading of \\""A Shot Of Rhythm & Blues\\"" and tears through a great, punchy \\""Dizzy Miss Lizzy\\"".    Their own songs sound magnificent as well. A driving \\""A Hard Day's Night\\"", the clanging, circular guitar riff of \\""Ticket To Ride\\"" ringing out...Well, you can check out the track list for youself.   This is a delightful 2hrs+ of music. The Beatles give it their all, and you can hear what a terrific little rock n' roll combo they were when they could actually hear each other playing!  Very highly recommended."
1332,4,"This album I was waiting a while for it to come out and its nice, glad to see he's still around doing his thing and he will get his credit for it soon."
1333,3,"After reading enthusiastic notices in Gramophone Magazine (Bryce Morrison) and here on Amazon (Messrs. Scott and Morrison below), I ordered Marc-Andre Hamelin's IBERIA with considerable eagerness. Yet when I ultimately listened to it, my bottom-line reaction was disappointment. Yes, I instantly admired many aspects of Hamelin's work, but as early as &#34;Almeria&#34; I had a nagging sense that something was missing -- and a large something at that; by the time I'd reached &#34;Jerez&#34; I was fairly sure where the problem lay, and after auditioning the whole set a second time through, I'd confirmed my fears.<br /><br />Down to cases. Hamelin's Steinway has a lean, pingy tone and a fast, light action. Thanks to this instrument (and to shrewdly chosen tempos), Hamelin produces exceptionally clear, fastidious playing in all the knotty finger passages, so &#34;El Corpus en Sevilla&#34; and &#34;El Albaicin&#34; are as shipshape, crisp, and transparent as you're ever likely to hear. But there's trouble with the basic sound itself. First, due to a combination of the instrument's limitations and his own, Hamelin fails to generate an authentic, full-bodied fortissimo anywhere on these discs -- when &#34;Triana&#34; calls for grit and power, de Larrocha easily outplays him, to say nothing of such oldsters as Rosenthal, Backhaus, or Rubinstein.<br /><br />Second and even more crucially, the many cantilena episodes point up a major hole in Hamelin's technical apparatus. To oversimplify the matter while furnishing a sizeable grain of truth: he can't play legato and he can't turn a phrase. Listen to the cantabile playing in &#34;Evocacion,&#34; &#34;Rodena,&#34; &#34;Almeria,&#34; and &#34;Jerez&#34;: his tone is thin and glassy, there's no real line, and dynamics are frequently restricted to pp-ppp -- which means that nuances or inflections are marginal, and such niceties as pedal tintings, echo effects, and tapered cadences are nowhere to be heard. True, the snap and tidiness of Hamelin's passagework often saves things, but not always -- among the fillers here, the meditative, quarter-hour &#34;La Vega&#34; comes off as bland, colorless, and interminable.<br /><br />So what's wrong with this picture? Well, a pianist with a poor sound, according to the pedagogue Pedro de Alcantara, &#34;may have great dexterity, which is but one aspect of technique, but he does not have a great technique. A complete technique implies the ability to play legato and sostenuto, in a wide range of dynamics and articulations, in every imaginable colour.&#34; Unfortunately this kind of balanced, encompassing mechanism is a scarce commodity these days -- Hamelin's shortcomings, sadly, are shared by many of our current East Coast conservatory products (and even by some big-name outsiders, e.g., Kissin).<br /><br />It's dismaying, too, that Hamelin could follow so closely on Rubinstein's heels (not only here but in his Szymanowski and Villa-Lobos projects) and glean so little from the experience -- especially since Rubinstein's work models just what Hamelin most needs to learn: production of a huge, deep, columnar fortissimo, as well as round, floating, prismatic tone from ppp to f (the equivalent of a great singer's mezza voce). At the very least Hamelin needs to consider giving up the ease and safety of his shallow-action Steinway and adjusting to a more neutral specimen with greater solidity and range: with such instruments, after all, several prior greats -- not only Rubinstein but the likes of Gieseking, Novaes, Rachmaninoff, Richter, and Kempff -- had no trouble generating the round, full-throated legato phrases that many of today's pianists can't.<br /><br />The other fillers here are of variable interest: Hamelin is too earnest and literal to extract much humor from Yvonne's comic stumblings, while he's small-boned and dainty (though immaculate) in the inevitable appendix of &#34;Navarra,&#34; a piece Albeniz disliked and abandoned. It's normally heard ina completion by his protege Severac, but Hamelin presents an alternative: an extended version composed by William Bolcom back in his student days. Whereas Severac's edition is in simple ABA song form, Bolcom stretches the piece into a sonata structure that often sounds merely busy and clattery. And since it winds up in exactly the same place as Severac's, the advantage is unclear.<br /><br />Where do you go for your desert-island IBERIA? Needless to say, all of de Larrocha's recordings are authoritative, but for power, dash, humor, earthiness, and a generous palette of gaudy colors, her 1962 Madrid traversal (EMI 764505) is arguably the richest, fullest statement of this music. This set also includes Albeniz's instantly adorable SUITE ESPANOLA plus de Larrocha's zesty &#34;Navarra&#34; in the standard version. As for integral versions that skip &#34;Navarra,&#34; the top runner-up is the little-known Ciccolini set from 1966 (EMI 76906), balletic, muscular, as transparent as Hamelin's but with a good deal more color and richness of line.<br /><br />So does this mean Messrs. Morrison, Scott, and Morrison are mistaken about Hamelin's new offering? Not entirely. As a backup set this release has several things to hold the interest: lovely recorded sound, offbeat filler pieces, and plenty of preternaturally neat fingerwork.presents an alternative: an extended version composed by William Bolcom back in his student days.

1335,4,"When I first heard \\""1 Thing,\\"" the high-pitched vocals made me cringe a little, yet the rhythm, music, and go go beat reminded me of Beyonce's \\""Crazy in Love.\\""  However, after a few more listens to this album, it grew on me.  There are only two songs I skip, \\""Like It Used to Be\\"" and \\""Just Like Me.\\""  I'm no music expert, but Touch is a much better album than Dangerously in Love.  Because Amerie works with mainly one producer, the sound of the CD is more cohesive without all the songs sounding the same.  She has a good mixture of slow and up-tempo songs, unlike Dangerously, which gets bogged down with ballads.  I love ballads, but in good measure.  The one drawback of Touch is that most of the songs lack an immediately identifiable chorus like \\""All I Need\\"" and  \\""Falling\\""--kind of like the bridge and chorus meld together--or the chorus is repetitive to the point of exhaustion (\\""1 Thing,\\"" \\""Talkin' About,\\"" \\""Come With Me,\\"" \\""Rolling Down My Face\\"").     But overall this is a good album.  Amerie has a pleasingly gritty soprano voice that is a mixture between Beyonce and Mary J. Blige, but she combines the two to create her own unique sound.    My favorites:  1) Not the Only One  2) Come With Me  3) Rolling Down My Face  4) Falling"
1336,4,"Every Day Is A New Day (1999) was described by some as \\""the divorce album\\"". Prior to the release of this album, Ross' then husband, the late Arne Naess, anoounced on National television his intent to divorce Ross before she even knew anything about it! This must have cut through the diva like a knife and the contents of this quite untypical album evidently reflects her thoughts and (distraught) feelings.  <br /> <br />Every Day Is A New Day was released shortly after that London Heathrow Airport incident where Ross was arrested and detained for hours on end after allegedly assaulting a female security officer (she protested at the fact that her breasts had to be touched during a body search). Ross became the scourge of the media, criticising her for the incident amd this may have perharps overshadowed the release of this album as i had expected this to be a big comeback for Ross. This was one of her most carefully conceived recording projects in some years and saw the soul diva colloborating with a multiple number of producers including Arif Mardin, Chuckii Booker, Steve Skinner and Malik Pendelton, who were all established and respected producers in the R&B genre.  <br /> <br />Every Day Is A New day had the soul diva carefully and succesfully updating her over-all style and sound. Some of the tracks capture some of her most gutsy, soulful performances in quite some time as she recorded only sporadically during the 1990's.  <br /> <br />The album opens with Ross' triumphant and soaring renedition of He Lives In You (originally recorded by another great diva Tina Turner for Walt Disney's animated classic, The Lion King). Ross is backed by an effective South African orchestra and rousing gospel vocals on the tracks chrous. Ross delivers a razor-sharp performance that's brimming with emotion. He Lives In You perfectly complimented her legendary, goddess-like status and some even went so far to say that this was her most magnificent and exciting recordings in years.  <br /> <br />The sparkling, vibrant ballad Love Is All That Matters, written by Diane Warren, was originally a duet with R&B sensation Brandy in Ross' television movie Double Platinum (1999). Ross' solo version is still effective and irrisistiable even though being familiar and quite typical of Ross' ballad stylings.  <br /> <br />More unusual was Ross' blatantly personal, heartaching ballad, Until We Meet Again. It's undoubted that Ross was thinking of Arner Naess as she sings this song in anunusually deeper,huskier style. These emotions are evidently stirred up inside her as you hear her yearning, almost anguish-filled voice.  <br /> <br />The album then abruptly swerves direction and drives into urban R&B terriotry on the cool, groovy Got To Be Free. Despite all of Ross' enduring glamour and elegance on stage she still (thankfully) retains some of that streetwise edge in her singing on tracks such as Got To Be Free. She enhances her delicate, melting voice to great effect on the verses whilst the chrous is contagious. This, complete with divine musical arranegements, would have made an ideal choice for release as a single but it remainded hidden away on this album.  <br /> <br />The original, jazzy version of her club hit Not Over You Yet is deep and mellow with swirling, electronic, R&B flavoured sound effects on the tracks dreamy chrous. Ross is in superb voice, delivering another husky and compelling performance which was a complete contrast to the more famous dance she took into the British Top 10 charts. The gorgeous So They say continues the sweet, mellow mood and Ross' exuberant delivery is exhilirating.  <br /> <br />The haunting, atmospheric title track serves as one of the projects ultimate highlights. The startling, compelling mixture of Soul-Acid Jazz-R&B is ignited by a moody, interesting vocal performance from Ross. Without trying to analyse this too much, it is not too perceptive to detect the blatant mixed up emotions on this track where her soft,delicate voice shifts between seemingly points of utter despair to complete self re-assurance. This was the beginning of what seemed to be Ross'troubled period between the time of her arrest at Heathrow Airport until the (at one time unthinkable) drunk-driving incident that led to Ross having a short spell in prison (well a total of just two days actually but for a world wide, phenomenal superstar like Diana Ross it still proved shocking). Every Day Is A New Day showed how Ross could comfortably hit the times impeccably well with, as usually the case with Ross, ease, style and finesse.  <br /> <br />Another reflective track was the catchy Sugar Free, a commercial-flavoured R&B number that is very uplifting in its content whilst the stand-out ballad of the album has to be the fabulous, Someone That You Loved Before. Ross delivers anotyher stunning, heart-aching performance with her soft, evocative voice shimmering with drama and emotion. This was also featured in her movie, Double Platinum and was released as an American single though all too typically the Americans just weren't interested in any new Diana Ross record with interest in her solely generated on re-packagings of her greatest hits.  <br /> <br />Hope Is An Open Window was a blatant attempt at updating the whole Reach Out And Touch (Somebody's Hand) ethos though it fails to live up to the anthemic qualities of that track. Ross' stellar performance is impressive to say the least but her singing is literally drowned out at points by the raging gospel backing choir on the tracks chrous.  <br /> <br />Carry On captures a red blooded, ferocious performance from the great soul diva. The fire and passion in her voice burns bright as she belts out this number with all her heart and soul, getting down and sounding like a true club mama! Ross showed she hadn't lost her touch on this jamming, rip-roaring number where her sharp, distinct vocals surfboard along those pumping, heavy bass-line, pulsating rhythms. A greatdance record that is a would be classic. Undoubtedly should have been lifetd as a single.  <br /> <br />The album then bows out (this review refers to the English release of this album so some of the remixes vary on the American version) out on another pumping dance tune, Not Over You Yet that became a big club hit in late 1999 as well as crossing over on to the main U.K Top 10 charts. i had just turend 20 when this came out and remembered really loving dancing to it in the clubs - infact it still stands very well now. It certainly showed that Ross hadn't lost that fire, sassiness and streetwise edge. Fntastic!  <br /> <br />After the U.K Top 10 success of Not Over You Yet it looked as though Every Day Is A New Day was set to be a smash hit but alas, and rather bizarrley, the album peaked at No.71, spending just one week on the chart listings whilst not even embracing the U.S Top 100. Even so Every Day Is A New Day is overly a really great album from the soul diva and fans undoubtedly will be delighted!  <br /> <br /> <br />Ian Phillips  <br />"
1337,5,"I have to say that anything that comes out with Gackt's name on it is a master piece. He is a God. He is the most talented Singer out there right now and not to mention he's one sexy Bishonen and he is Bisexual (look at Vanilla Live Music Video). It's a shame that not many people know about him, so I share his voice and music with everyone I can. Snap up all of his CDs you can and his Movie, Moon Child. His songs are pure talent."
1338,5,"I love this album and Dashboard. Chris's voice is kind of strange, but it is good. It gives Dashboard a unique sound that no one else can quite match! : ) <br /> <br />the best tracks on this album are Hands Down, Rapid Hope Loss, As Lovers Go, Bend And Not Break, Ghost Of A Good Thing, Morning Calls, and Several Ways To Die Trying <br /> <br />wow..half the album is on my best tracks list. i guess that is a testament to how good it is!! <br /> <br />the only bad track is Carry This Picture. i would skip over it..because it gets boring after about the second verse. <br /> <br />anyway, i would definetly advise you to buy this album, even if u have never listened to \\""emo\\"" before. i hadn't listened to emo before either and now i love it!! <br />"
1339,4,"Finally, an instrumental cd that allows dj's to mix without <br />having to buy the single to every popular hip hop song just to <br />get the instrumental. Hopefully more will come."
1340,4,"OK so after being reccomended by Seemingly everyone who shares my music taste to check this band out, I finally decided to give this band a shot. And since I never actually start with a bands first album anyway I thought I might as well start here.  <br />   As far as the album goes It is a very good ep. Really creative, amazing intrumentation if you are into rapid time signiture, and tempo changes. But here are some points to consider. <br /> <br />   1) Although the content is excelent. The sound quality kinda sucks (which is why I rated it four stars instead of five). A lot of reviewers claim that the live tracks sound so much like the studio ones. This is probably because the studio songs have so little added in the production process that it really sounds like one big live recording (in other words kinda thin). <br />  <br />   2) Ok actually I hadn't heard any songs off this album or any tool songs really, and for the most part what I had heard of Keenan's vocals were on the cameos he did for other bands (I assume that now you will think that I know nothing, and say that this is not a helpful review because I havent been worshipping this band for years), and the haunting wail he presented there (Rage against the machine, deftones anyone?). Here his voice is definatly on the raw side (i'm not complaining his voice is still mezmerising, especially on sweat, and opiate.), so dont be all that suprised. But hey everyone's got to start somewhere. <br /> <br />    3) MAN, THIS GUY IS ANGRY. I mean this guy makes your average angst rocker sound like that guy from linkin park. That and the lyrics, though very well thought out, are pretty dark (Example: me and him [god] both have our desires. WE both want to rape you! from opiate). Alhtough if your reading this review I doubt you care, especially if your a huge tool fan, just I wouldnt reccomend showing the this to the sensitive ( siblings, offspring, ect.). Like another reviewer said this is not a safe album. <br /><br />   4) As Far as the That negative reviewer who said this is just for overwieght, loaner, teenagers, who are jealous of thier prettier peers, for one is probably some loser who had his fun in high school, but blew off his education, and now works at some dead end job with a miserable life, and is also making a false generallization. I'm a teenager, but I'm not a loaner, i'm jealous of nobody, and i'm definatly not overwieght. As far as the guy who said he played it in his yoga class and he hated it, although I'm not blaming you for growing to peaceful to enjoy this album, it's sort of a no brainer that this isn't going to go over well in a yoga class.  <br /> <br />  So for those of you out there, who are open minded, and don't believe that \\""they will be damned for listening to an antichrist band.\\"" Then this album, though short, is a great buy. After all even harmless billy joel once said \\""i'd rather laugh with the sinners, then cry with the saints, you know the sinners are much more fun.\\"" An excellent choice for all you sinners out there."
1341,5,"When I started hearing \\""Zoot Suit Riot\\"" I would sing with my friends and we'd alternate the lyrics \\""throw back a bottle of beer\\"" to \\""throw back a bottle of root beer,\\"" because we were in 6th and 7th grade and we didn't like the alcohol references. The title cut, \\""Pink Elephant\\"" and \\""Master and Slave\\"" are the top 3 songs on this CD. As said in one of the reviews there are a few songs with vulgar lyrics, but most of them don't have too many. The CD is very good, especially if you like swing music."
1342,5,"This was the CD released at the height of the Pearl Jam craze, but thats just fine me, becasue i love both bands, but as i said on my Apple review, this album is truly timeless with all the tracks from Apple plus demo's that never made the final cut, all of which are fantastic regardless, Andrew Wood was an excellent song writer who would have made it HUGE with Mother Love Bone, sadly Wood did not live to see the release of Apple due to dying of a heroin overdose just before MLB's first national tour, every song is excellent on Stardog Champion and it is highly recommended for any fan of 90's rock, grunge, glam, etc. RIP Andrew Wood 1966-1990"
1343,5,"In a recent heady discussion with noted Houston rock critic, Mark Pope, on the role that late 80's dance DJ/ composers (Kyper and U.T.F.O. as the primary influences, of course!) had on the fall of Apartheid in South Africa, I accidentally misspelled Kyper's name \\""Kiper\\"" in a message board discussion. Mr. Pope gave me the following admonishment: <br /> <br />\\""C'mon NEEKOLZ, give the fellow Louisiana native rapper some props by spelling his name correctly. Do you also remember \\""X-stasy\\"" and \\""Conceited\\""?? He was an underappreciated talent.\\"" <br /> <br />With that statement, I did recall seeing some grainy footage of Nelson Mandela, in a jail cell, moving to Kyper's hypnotic beats, crossing his arms in front of his enlightened eyes, chanting \\""X-stasy, X-stasy\\"". His body was hyped indeed, he was ready to lead a revolution. <br /> <br />As note in the above review, Kyper is nothing short of a musical genius and he ill-deserves patronizing comparisons to groups like U.T.F.O. <br /> <br />If Kyper happens upon this, I issue a complete apology for not having the decency to spell his name correctly."
1344,4,"I've always had a slightly ambivalent feeling about Williams--she's a genuine original, unlike anyone else in the jazz piano canon, yet her mannerisms can get a little irritating: in particular, her inability to get through a chorus without throwing in a quote or three.  Still, it'd be curmudgeonly to complain too much about someone who makes such consistantly enjoyable albums (& she does record a lot of them).  This one is a solo concert, mostly in her quirky tinkling stride-piano vein; there's a few nice, sparing originals (especially \\""Dear Gaylord\\""), some handsome standards, & something of an emphasis on the blues, with a 15-minute version of \\""Straight No Chaser\\"" being the disc's centrepiece.  Her quoting habits get the better of her at a few points (for instance, she ends \\""Straight No Chaser\\"" with \\""The Stars and Stripes Forever\\""), but on the whole this is a very strong disc, recommended to anyone looking for a sampler of Jessica's work."
1345,3,"Overall, this compilation is pretty weak...but a good way to get \\""introduced\\"" to one of the greatest musicians of all time.  Misunderstood as they come, Cave has released so many good albums, most of which I've reviewed on here and all of which I own. I felt it was my duty as a fan to go pick up this cd.  It doesn't contain enough of his older stuff.  Here is what I would consider to be a better collection of 16 Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds songs:<br /><br />From Her to Eternity<br /><br />The Six Strings That Drew Blood<br /><br />The Mercy Seat<br /><br />City of Refuge<br /><br />Sad Waters<br /><br />The Weeping Song<br /><br />Loom of the Land<br /><br />John Finn's Wife<br /><br />Straight to You<br /><br />Jangling Jack<br /><br />Loverman<br /><br />Lay Me Low<br /><br />Into My Arms<br /><br />Stagger Lee<br /><br />Brompton Oratory<br /><br />People Ain't No Good<br /><br />That's just my opinion.  I'd reccommend starting a full Nick Cave collection, beginning with his first cd, rather than buying this \\""best of.\\"""
1346,5,"I have always loved Michelangeli. Some may say he is cold and impersonal, but that is not the case. He is aristocratic. Aristocracy doesn't stoop down to a personal level that a peasant does, and Michelangeli enobles his music in a hierarchical fashion.  I like two interpretations of the preludes, one is this one by Michelangeli and the other is by Alfred Cortot. While both are diametrically opposed, both are equally valid. Anyone who would critcize this recording is only showing jealousy. Sometimes it is more important to listen to an individual as an individual, not as someone filtered through one's own personal preferences. When we can play as well as Michelangeli then we are in a position to complain about this or that. While there are things that he does which I might not have done in the same way, I recognize from his point of view why such a choice was made. This is the difference between hearing and listening. The reviewer who gave this recording 3 stars should think about this. There is a difference between what is great and what is liked. Just some food for thought."
1347,3,"While I'm in the minority of folks who preferred \\""Mit Gas\\"" to Tomahawk's debut album, I still found it to be somewhat disappointing.  The band, primarily vocalist Mike Patton and guitarist Duane Denison, produced a pair of records with similar moods-- angry, aggressive music.  But on \\""Mit Gas\\"", the music is matched by much more in your face production, but I also think its a much better focused album and stands more independent from its principles previous bands.    Again, there's a lack of soloing, with the album targeted at more texture oriented playing behind Patton's shouted and growled vocals-- the whole album doesn't hit (\\""You Can't Win\\""), but when it does, its fantastic hard rock (\\""Rape This Day\\"", \\""Rotgut\\"") or falls a bit into balladry (drum-loop driven ballad \\""Capt. Midnight\\"", with its bizarre effecting vocal, the emotive \\""Desastre Natural\\"").  The problem is, there's a balance of mediocre material thats good enough, but doesn't really stand out, or stand up (\\""Mayday\\"", \\""When Stars Begin to Fall\\"").  The end of the album drifts into a more experimental vein, with the totally bizarre \\""Aktion 13th\\"" being the best and strangest.    Still, if you come from a more straightahead background (I came to Patton's work from his avant-garde leanings), you may enjoy this more than I do."
1348,5,"ok, so along with most other people writing the reviews, i was upset that this didn't have the \\""Remember Right Now\\"" sound and feel, and i hated the new songs that i heard on purevolume at first, but, i decided to pick up the cd anyway, and i've listened to it a few times now, and the songs are actually really good, and they stick in my head, i agree, they COULD have made a better cd, but, i'm 100% happy with this purchase, i just hope they get a little more pop back in the sound on the next album, if you liked remember right now, or like fall out boy... check this band out on purevolume and myspace, My Former Self"
1349,5,"This is one of the best alt rock bands I've heard since Franz Ferdinand. I love the whole CD and I have a feeling that one day they're gonna make it big. If you have any interest in buying this CD, I definitely reccomend it."
1350,4,"This is another great Out Of Eden Album,this is my <br />fifth album that I have bought from them. <br />There vocals and harmonies are even more awesome on <br />this album especially on songs IMMORTAL,INVISIBLE, <br />GOD ONLY WISE and HAVE MERCY which is the most  <br />beautifullist song I have heard in a long time.This <br />is another must have for any OUT OF EDEN fan. <br /> <br />GOD BLESS,"
1351,4,"Until today I had only been vaguely familiar with the work of Napalm Death and Godflesh. That's to say I never took the time to research their histories or biographies. The founding member of both of those bands is Justin Broadrick. He has since moved on from each of them. But despite the fact that he's been working in music for a very long time, his devoted fans still can't seem to get enough of his music. The overwhelming response to his latest project, Jesu, is no exception and will undoubtedly uncover a lot more about him than most of us are aware.   <br /> <br />In attempting to gather some information about the history of Broadrick, it became clear that message boards were lighting up and fans were praising his return. Admittedly, I am not one that belongs to that list of followers, nor am I wholly versed in the (apparently) vast amount of influence he's had on metal music, but I can certainly appreciate the dedication of his followers and the feelings I get from listening to this new material.  <br /> <br />If you are familiar with the recent work of label mates, Pelican, you'll be in tune with what's going on here. Jesu's music is intense in that it utilizes effects and atmosphere to carry the weight of the album. To go a step further would be to call it a doom metal album met with the heady aesthetic of My Bloody Valentine. But contrary to those comparisons, Jesu meets us with an emotionally charged affection that is still rarely heard in guitar-heavy albums.   <br /> <br />One doesn't simply listen to Jesu; rather, it is absorbed as it washes over you in layers of temperate colors. These songs are lengthy with pleasant repetition, which allows them time to breathe and become trance-like. The most perfect example of this comes near the end, with \\""Sun Day.\\"" This is a song that is decidedly one of the heaviest tracks of the bunch, yet I'm still drawn to the emotive qualities that keep it from crossing over to the aggressive side of metal. And it's this difference that makes Jesu such a welcomed change from the norm.    <br /> <br />By the end, the unexpected becomes the expected. There are no surprises hidden underneath the layers of sound, just infectious shoegazer doom that lends itself well to many repeated listens. While I may have heard a Godflesh album or two, this material is unquestionably more up my alley. However, because I've admitted that I'm not one of those fans who have followed Broadrick's career with a microscope, I may just have to find some time to delve into a few of his side-projects to see if he truly is the metal icon his fans make him out to be."
1352,5,"its not easy doing the MIGHTY \\""SAXON\\"" justice, but most all of these artists do just that. if you love your metal hard as hell and ready to pummel the eardrums. pick this one up"
1353,4,"It's hard to top two of the best, fiercest rock'n'roll albums ever made (1984's \\""On Fyre\\"" and 1986's \\""Lyres Lyres\\""), and compared to those two discs, Jeff Conolly's ensuing record was kind of a letdown when it came out in '88. But with the passage of time, the album is a cut above most of what \\""rock\\"" has devolved into since (maybe The Hives aside). <br />Fellow reviewer K.C. Fennessy has already listed the many covers and their origins (Monoman has always had good taste in covers), so no need to rehash. The \\""buyer beware\\"" isn't a ripoff alert; rather, it's an alert that different versions of the CD have different extra tracks. <br />Amazon and Fennessy have the 16 tracks from the Matador reissue listed, and that's what I thought I was buying. Instead, I got a copy of a reissue from the Georgia label Fundamental Music, which has 21 tracks. It has five extra live tracks (origin not listed, but I think they showed up on some Ace of Hearts singles in the late '80s), all live Lyres staples: \\""Jezebel\\"" (The Teddy Boys''64 raveup of Frankie Laine), \\""Go-Go Girl\\"" (a tear through Marc Bolan's \\""Mustang Ford\\""), \\""Help You Ann,\\"" \\""Don't Give It Up Now\\"" and another Sonics standard, \\""Cinderella\\"" (which Jeff's been doing since his DMZ days). All are loud and distorted for your listening pleasure. Just be warned: It sounds like Conolly was messed up that night (not uncommon, which is why I stopped going to live Lyres shows), and this version of \\""Don't Give It Up Now\\"" finds him ad-libbing a crass line about sex and AIDS. <br />Also, \\""We Sell Soul\\"" is on the Matador re-release, but not the Fundamental CD. But the song, a 5-star version of Roky Erickson's first A-side with The Spades, first appeared on the cassette version (though not the CD) of the 1990 Warner Bros. Erickson tribute, \\""Where the Pyramid Meets the Eye,\\"" and can also be found on two '90s Lyres CDs on Taang!: The EP \\""Nobody But Lyres\\"" and the full-length collection \\""Some Lyres.\\"""
1354,1,"50-cent sucks. He just plain sucks. Classical music is better than this junk. rap is bad no matter who's singing. 50-cent is a gay over shot loser who has other people create songs for him to sing and get rich off of, while the designer of the song get 5%. all rap is the same. People just sing blurred words, that would rhyme if you could hear them. Nothing special. In contrast, a rock band actually plays an instrument and sings words you can hear, understand, and sing along to. if you want good music buy a Green Day or U2 CD. It's just my opinion but, I'M RIGHT! 50-CENT SUCKS.                         3 reasons why you should not buy this CD:    1. 50-cent is isn't talented, he doesn't play an instrument.  2. 50-cent is hated so much that hes been shot 9 times.  3. He raps so bad he needs to play his backround music louder than his voice so that nobody can hear his voice.    I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND BUYING THIS CD."
1355,3,"This is certainly an honor to the band and their great music.  But, it lacks something.  A few of the cuts come off ok -- but others just rub me wrong.  I think it could have worked better had it been arranged differently.  (I have always thought Rush tunes would sound great played by a full orchestra -- it seems to me a full percussion section is required)."
1356,5,Breathtaking creation of ambient sounds that will leave you mesmerized. I am robot and proud gives us an album packed with sounds to awaken your senses. I highly recommend to all that can open their mind to receive such a wonderful gift.
1357,3,"Just to let you all know that were wondering why Phoenix isn't more popular... he missed his chance.  Phoenix Stone was the ORIGINAL member of the Backstreet Boys.  He chose to quit the band, go against Lou Perlman, and begin his solo career - he felt the boyband scene would never develop and thought he'd do better on this own.  He was later replace by Brian Littrel. <br /> <br />Just goes to show... you don't ever want to make Lou Perlman mad! <br /> <br />Just thought I'd clear up who this guy is."
1358,5,"Let me preface this by saying I'm not a professional reviewer - nor am I a connoisseur of this genre of music. In fact, I prefer my music electronic and upbeat. However, this album completely rocked my little boxed-up world. Twilight is beautiful, melodic, soulful, calming and like nothing else you've heard. The songs have just the right amount of \\""hooks\\"" or elements you can grab hold of and remember. But they're far from ordinary and hold nuances you won't notice until the 10th, 20th, 30th time you listen.<br /><br />Many say this album (or this type of music) is depressing. I disagree. Music that moves you inward can be calming if you like what you find within. Sometimes dark and sometimes light, Twilight is an avenue to an honest place. Revel in its beauty and let it haunt you. Appreciate its honesty about the world around us. Hear the fine musicianship that's executed perfectly, yet is risky and creative at the same time. Hear the vocals that are strong and hypnotizing with lyrics that seem familiar but are full of double meanings and twists.<br /><br />Never boring, yet consistently soothing and enrapturing, this album will transport you somewhere else."
1359,5,This woman can sing anything!!  Awesome Awesome CD!
1360,5,"Open Hand has not come out with new music, except a few demos in 5 years, since the release of the Evolutions EP.  Well, it has been worth the wait.  The music on this record is so rock and roll i cannot even begin to explain.  Few bands of today can write the guitar riff you will hear.  The guitars have the cKy type of riffs and the drumming is very powerful and to the point.  Justin's vocals swoon over the landscape in a captivating way.  Not one song sounds the same on here.  Some are very rock and roll, others are spacey, a few ballads are thrown in there.... all in all, its a great record.  Standout tracks:  You and Me, Tough Guy, Hard Night, Crooked Crown, Trench Warfare to name a few.... but in all reality, they all stand out.  Go buy this record and bang your head upon arrival."
1361,4,"Ghost returned to quick to drop this album I think (just 20 months off, which is unheard of for Wu releases) and the quality shows.  Although it is still a solid album (4 stars) it's just a little behind his other 3 solo ones.  Once again the track listing is all f**ked up (like on \\""Supreme Clientele\\"") and you have to go to his website for the real one.  Production is decent but could have been better and is handled mostly by RZA, Mathematics & ALChemist - with Six July, Undadawgs, and Chris Ligio each doing 1 song.  Guests are all over the album as well (I am glad to see Rae on 4 or 5 songs) but you don't get as much of Ghost's goofy off-the-wall lyrics as we all love and want.  He samples a few old beats like only he can.  It does have 1 classic, 1 near classic, a few good ones and a few I can't decide if their good or ok.  Still a good album to check out for his fans.    #2 - 9 (f/ raekwon -- god story line)  #3 - 8 (f/ raekwon, method man, lord superb)  #4 - 9.5 (great song about an ex -- f/ carl thomas & raekwon)  #6 - 8 (f/ trife da god & twiz)  #7 - 7 (f/ ??)  #8 - 7.5 (f/ killa sin)  #9 - 10 (CLASSIC -- uses old characters from cartoons & fairy tales to tell a story -- f/ raekwon)  #10 - 9 (f/ trife da god & lord superb)  #11 - 8 (upbeat song f/ Tekitha)  #12 (skit)  #13 - 7.5 or  8 (f/ raekwon)  #14 - 8.5 (24 bar freestyle)  #15 - 8.5 (slower song f/ Ruff Endz)  #16 - 7.5 or 8 (f/ trife da god & solomon childs)    Dennis Coles -- b. around 1972 -- Stapleton, Staten Island, NY  Check all my reviews"
1362,4,"If you expect surprises with Darkthrone you are are mistaken.It's black metal no more no less. That is not to mean that it is one dimensional or boring.Nor is it trying desperately to fit any of the cliques that have appeared in black metal (progressive, pompous, \\""necro\\"",etc).Darkthrone show that it is possible to take influence from any kind of music and still make quality music without sounding like those influences.<br /><br />Perhaps the reviewer who gave this three stars expects too much from Darkthrone as we all do from the true quality bands. I always feel disappointed by new Slayer or Morbid Angel albums simply because they have produced such monumental music before-their average is another band's best album ever.And Fenriz's lyrics are brilliant-dark, metal but not overdramatic or dumb.Just quality."
1363,2,"I'm not here to bash switchfoot. They do have talent and i wish them the best of success. HOWEVER, i'm still here to give my opinion on the album, and that is what i shall do.  <br /> <br />1. Meant to live- I enjoy this song alot. Good choice for a first single 4/5 <br /> <br />2. This is your life- The lyircs are thoughtful, but the music itself is very boring 2/5 <br /> <br />3. More than fine- I don't like it. Again, its just too boring 2/5 <br /> <br />4. Ammunition- Very good song, hands down my favorite on the album 5/5 <br /> <br />5. Dare you to move- Ugg, I don't like, but the video-remake is pretty awesome 1/5 <br /> <br />6. Redemption- Its okay, i like the verses 3/5 <br /> <br />7. Beautiful letdown- another long and drawnout borefest 1/5 <br /> <br />8. Gone- Very, VERY GOOD. Second only to Ammunition 5/5 <br /> <br />9. On Fire- Borefest 1/5 <br /> <br />10. Adding to the noise- lots of aggression, but not my favorite 3/5 <br /> <br />11. 24- Tops the lot for the boredom factor 0/5 <br /> <br />So overall, there were some highs, but unfortunatly more lows. Like I said before, If this album makes you happy and you think it deserves 5 stars overall, then I hope my bad review is watered down by the many other good ones. \\""the beautiful letdown\\"" may be many things to many people, but to me, it wasn't really anything at all."
1364,2,"My brother listed in one of his guides last year that Lil' Flip was the most overrated rapper of 2004. I wholeheartedly agree with that (even though I chose Nelly for that honor). I never really was much of a Lil' Flip fan, but I decided to check out this album anyway. A lot of the reviews are just talking about whether Flip is better or worse than T.I., but I think I'm going to talk about what I'm sure you readers want to REALLY hear about: how the actual album is.<br /><br />Editorial reviewer Rebecca Levine did a pretty good job assessing the album, and I also agree with everyone that said that \\""Game Over (Flip)\\"" is the only good song on the album. And that's really sad, considering that it's a two-disc set (although it only adds up to a little over ninety minutes). Flip doesn't really say anything else on here to make things stand out. On Disc 1 (the longer disc), there are several mediocre interpretations of been-there-done-that tales, like \\""Represent\\"" and the Cam'ron-assisted \\""All I Know\\"". And \\""Ain't No Party\\"" sounds like it was made in 1992. If you don't know where I'm going with this, check the chorus: \\""Ain't no party like a Lil' Flip party/`Cause a Lil' Flip party don't stop.\\"" And then he goes into: \\""Put your hands up/Put your hands down.\\"" What?<br /><br />Although Ludacris gives a decent performance on \\""I Came to Bring the Pain\\"", it can't save the rest of the song, especially since it features a lazy sample of Method Man's \\""Bring the Pain\\"". There's also a little repetitiveness with the titles (\\""Sun Don't Shine\\"", \\""Sunshine\\""). The former is a generic keep-your-head-up song, while the latter is, as XXL Magazine said best, one of the most overrated songs that came out last year. \\""I'll treat you like milk/I'll do nothing but spoil you\\""? Negro, please.<br /><br />Even though Disc 2 is the shorter disc, it seems to contain even worse songs. \\""What's My Name\\"" is tired, but even worse than that is when Flip decides to recruit the Diplomats. And their song, \\""Y'all Don't Want It\\"", makes me think that they were reading the fans' minds. There are also screwed versions of two songs (\\""Drugz\\"" and \\""Dem Boyz\\""), but the problem with screwed songs is that if the lyrics are wack, it makes that really evident to the listener. (Check \\""Drugz\\"": \\""`Cause I ain't Hollywood/I'm from the Hollyhood/The difference between me and<br /><br />them?/My music good.\\"")<br /><br />Lil' Flip may be an undaground legend in the South, but he doesn't seem to be doing anything for the rest of the world -- at least, not for me. U Gotta Feel Me? Oh, no you don't.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert<br /><br />P.S.

1365,5,"Wow...what can I say. I become a fan of KJ after album one. He is a phenomenal story teller which is what makes is his witnessing so powerful. Clever lyrics and beats to bounce to make every single track he does playable again and again.  <br /> <br />He is able to take complexity of life and weave stories with the simplicity of faith and salvation in ways that just ministers to the heart but delivers a good time all at that the same time. <br /> <br />What really comes across is the relationship he has with Jesus. It clearly translates well. This young man is speaking from his relationship with God. He is very much in touch with heart for reaching the lost and serving his Lord. <br /> <br />KJ, you go son...you inspire me. Thank you for delivering such quality music for everyone. <br /> <br />My God continue to bless you and may also experience the financial (yes...I said money...money is not evil and christians should have plenty of too!) success from your projects that you so deserve. Just don't forget to tithe! :-)"
1366,5,"Though most prefer Paranoid and Master of Reality, this album is, atleast in my opinion, pretty easily Sabbath's best. This album mixes heavy metal, hard rock, and psychedelia, and is one of the greatest albums EVAR! <br /> <br />1. Wheels of Confusion/The Straightener - 10/10 One of Sabbath's greatest songs. An almost psychedelic song. <br />2. Tomorrow's Dream - 10/10 Almost seems like Wheels of Confusion/The Straightener Part II. Another great song. <br />3. Changes - 10/10 Sabbath fans seem to be split on this one. I presonally think it's a great song. <br />4. FX - 9.5/10 A short little psychedelic instrumental. <br />5. Supernaut - 10/10 The best on the album, and possibly Sabbath's best.  <br />6. Snowblind - 9.5/10 <br />7. Cornucopia - 9.5/10 <br />8. Laguna Sunrise - 10/10 A great acoustic instrumental. <br />9. St. Vitus Dance - 8.4/10 <br />10. Under The Sun/Every Day Comes and Goes - 9.5/10 <br /> <br />Overall - 10/10 <br />"
1367,4,"I've been a nonpoint fan for years, and by chance I stumbled upon this site, and read some of the user reviews.  Most leaned towards the harsh side, which I found to be disappointing.  I hate to hear them being piled into the nu-metal classification, as they transcend that genre with class and a keen sense of melody.  So, they threw out a medley of hip-hop covers at the end of their album....does that make them any less respectable?  I think not.  Not every band in the world is solely influenced by led zepplin or Black Sabbath.  Consider it a tribute, as it is titled.  Beyond that, this is an impressive first effort by a young band who managed to get their business in order.  One review I read was rather harsh, and I say this from a musician's perspective.  Fans tend to disregard the hard work and endless time it takes to put together an album, let alone one as good as this.  It may be admittedly raw, but the pure talent does manage to shine through and in the end, the rawness adds to the whole element.  And if you've followed nonpoint for any time, you'd testify to the fact that they're one of the hardest working bands around, often touring 3/4 of a year to support any one of their albums.  And with their next 2 albums they have matured into an excellently melodic metal outfit in every facet."
1368,5,"I can't say enough about how great this CD is.  Every song on this album is good. My favorite tracks are Eleanor, Julia, and Diary.  This album has it all, the lyrical content equals the musical content. Adam Cohen has crafted such dark and relateable lyrics. They are sexual, they are lamenting, they are sad, they are angry but most of all they Rock."
1369,5,"Album has a haunting almost spiritual sense to it, with an approach to the musicianship that seems relaxed. The talent is so strong in this work you could almost imagine it was unrehearsed, thou obviously well performed the mistake and retake I loved having been in a band in school.It helped put the performer in my mind in person in front of me. You get the joy of his music expressed in a work that is satisfying to the soul I have turned many people toward this album the commercial world wont quite understand this work But give it a try I liked the medley which is unique. I can see him in my mind as a  Bakerstreet muse, this album is a close your eyes and picture the story as the minstrel sings."
1370,3,"Now if you ask me, and a lot of folks do now and again, this here album is representative of the continuing slide of Paul's work down the charts as the 80s progressed. This one made it up to #30 and lasted only a week before disappearing in to obscurity... despite a relatively strong single in \\""Press.\\"" <br /> <br />See, by this time, the world was truly turning its attention elsewhere and Paul was still making the same formulaic music that was his strength in the 1970s except the world had moved on to the 1980s and was fixin to get ready to start changing for the 1990s... and that, my dear review reader, is the progression of time. See, time waits n\for no man (and only 10 minutes for a woman) and Paul was kind of caught in a time warp with his music. I happen to like this album a lot, but even when it came out it was dated. <br /> <br />I ain't got much to say about this one, except that the twins particularly like the album due to the nice sepia tone cover artwork that features Paul and the late Linda looking like a couple from the 1940s. They refer to this one as \\""the romantic album\\"" because they think the photo looks romantic. Me and Mama listen to it now and again, but not nearly as much as his other stuff. <br /> <br />If you absolutely have to have everything he ever done did - then go ahead on and get this one. If not, then there are better album from which to start discovering McCartney."
1371,5,"Tom Rush really had two careers.  He started out in the early 60's doing nice covers of some great folk and country blues classic for Verve/Folkways, then Elektra.  Then somewhere along the line he began discovering great music by then-unheralded songwriters, and his truly excellent covers of their songs often brought them more commercial attention than they'd had up to then.  His covers of \\""Urge for Going\\"" and \\""Circle Game\\"" did good things for Joni Mitchell, he recorded \\""Something in the Way She Moves\\"" and \\""Sunshine Sunshine\\"" before James Taylor's first LP and \\""Shadow Dream Song\\"" before Jackson Browne made it big.  These two ablums (his first two for Columbia--he'd already left Elektra at this point) have great covers of Taylor, Browne, Jesse Colin Young, Fred Neil, and Murray McLaughlin, among others.  I agree with some previous reviewers that Rush's rendition of \\""Biloxi\\"" is one of the real jewels here, but let's set the record straight.  It's not his song and it's not Jimmy Buffett's.  The author is Jesse Winchester.  If you want to hear more like it, hunt down Winchester's self-titled debut on Bearsville Records.   <br />P.S., both of these albums have some great lead guitar work by Rush's long-time sideman Trevor Veitch."
1372,5,"Sonata Arctica's sophomore effort, 'Silence' (2001) shows true signs of maturity for such a young group. True, they did show this on their debout, 'Ecliptica' (1999), but it's shown just as well here. Though this is not quite up to par with the 2003 masterpiece 'Winterheart's Guild,' 'Silence' showcases the band's most synth-driven album to date (at least of the ones that are available here currently-'Reckoning Night' (2004) isn't scheduled for a US release until February 2005.)<br /><br />The band is one of the most talented progressive/power metal bands Europe has seen in a long time, and it is easy to see a major influence from fellow Finns Stratovarius and a bit of Children of Bodom as well (who are also Finnish.) Singer Tony Kakko is amazing, he sounds like the perfect balance of Timo Kotipelto and an classically trained tenor. Guitarist Jani Liimatainen may dish out some very fast and simplistic riffs, but his solos are top notch. Bassist Marko Paasikoski is extremely quick much of the time (mainly because he plays with a pick), but he is still extremely good. Keyboardist Mikko Harkkin's fast fingers are practically the melodies that the band depend on for this album. His solos are amazing, as are the sound they produce. Drummer Tommy Portimo is lightning fast on that double bass part, and his snare, cymbal, etc. techniques are great too.<br /><br />And now, of course the highlights: \\""Weballergy\\"" may be the fastest song Sonata Arctica ever did, and the synth part is amazing...but the solos (guitar and keyboard) are really where it's at. \\""Black Sheep\\"" is not quite as fast as \\""Weballergy,\\"" but the harmonizing method between the keys and guitar is insane. And \\""Wolf and Raven\\"" is also extremely fast, and the intro/midpoint shredding technique is astounding, by far my favorite on the record. Fans of bands like Stratovarius,  Children of Bodom, Thunderstone, Nightwish, and Kotipelto (among others) should definetely give this a try.<br /><br />\\""Rock Forever!\\""-Judas Priest"
1373,5,"Wow these guys are great. They sound a lil bit like orgy when i first heard them, but then their sound stood out once i listened to them more. awesome awesome!"
1374,5,"Growing up, my family had maybe 2 or 3 holiday records...this was one of them.  We'd listen to the album over and over and over.  Not sure what made it so enchanting...or maybe just the simplicity and the fact that you'd be humming along to Must Be Santa all day long.  Shortly after Thanksgiving, as I dusted off the many holiday CD's that we have now, I just looked at them and sighed.   Besides Manheim (which I do love), I was simply bored with all the soul-less music that is out there today.  Seems like every artist today has to put out a holiday CD with all the same songs...nothing is memorable...and I can hardly listen to the radio having the fear that Clay Aiken might be on soon. <br /> <br />So with my fingers crossed, I searched Amazon to see if by any miracle I might find Mitch Miller's classic. And there popped up that familiar cover along with the amazing price of $6.99.  WOW!!  With two days shipping it was still less than the cost of a new CD n the local store.  When it was delivered I rushed home to put it on for my kids (8 and 11).  At first they didn't no what to make of it.  It sounded corny to them.  By the time Must Be Santa was playing, they begged me to play it over and over all night....and the next day...and the next.  How often does that happen anymore? <br /> <br />So if you remember this record as a child, do yourself a favor and share it with your kids...they will love it!"
1375,5,I'm tired of people reviewing cds and not listening to it all. Every song on this album is bumpin with bass. The lyrics are simply put TIGHT. New King of the South??
1376,1,"This is at best an interesting curiosity for the collector's library. Perhaps it was courageous for Faithfull to compete in an arena so dominated by one singer. But compared with the Lotte Lenya version (ASIN B000002991), her rendition sounds both mechanical and lugubrious."
1377,1,"What a joke, I was not sure what I was listening to.  Was it country was it rock? The record company could have done better then this. Diana is not the one to blame, her lyrics were weak and vocal arrangements was even weaker. I did not care for Clays album either and I listened to it several times to see what all the hype was about.  I feel the same way about this one.  I read the five & four-star reviews and was wondered if she release two different cds because the one than I listen to was laughable.  <br /> <br />I loved her on the show and I believed she should not have been in the final three.  We all know who should have made it to that point.  However, I knew if she was talented and was going to show back up on the music scene if she did not win. I wish she would have waited and took her time with the song selection process.  I understand that she wanted to release her CD in the wings of Fantasia to see if the Clay/Ruben strategy would work in her favor like it did for Clay.  I am not sure if this material will give her a Clay status. <br />"
1378,4,"I don't know what some people are thinking but this album rocks!  All of the other washed up bands are putting out crap.  Finally, someone puts out a ROCK album.  In my opinion this is better than most of the new albums being released today.  Metallica and the Crue are my favorite and well Metallica has not written any decent songs since the Black Album.  If you want to complain about mediocrity, listen to Velvet Revolver.  There is an album that doesn't live up to all the hype.  It sounds like STP with a better band behind Scott Weiland.  Slash should have gotten an unknown singer or at least a singer that sounded like Axl (without the attitude).  Maybe then the Velvet Revolver album wouldn't sound like an STP cover band that wrote their own songs.  You have to appreciate the Brides for what it is.....A Rock Album!!"
1379,2,"Wow is all I can say. What happened to VOD? I owned their 1st album and loved it for the raw energy and positive lyrics hidden behind the pummeling guitars. I picked up their latest and must say I am quite saddened to find that VOD has turned into a wannabe chimaira/switched/Damage Plan. Is it still hard? Yes. Is it straight ahead hardcore? No. The first 5-6 songs plod along with no real originallity and nothing to differentiate one between the other. The 2nd hald of the album picks up a little, but not much. <br /> <br />   What happened to these guy? They were a hardcore band and now they have tried to turn into some kind of metal band and they sound the same as about 8 other bands out in the market today. If this is their attempt to appeal to a larger fan base then i expect they won't have a record deal in 2-3 years"
1380,5,"This CD plays like a cornered animal. A cornered animal with serious issues. <br /> <br />If you've ever felt self-destructive, If you've ever seen the inside of a holding cell or a psyche ward, If you are more than just a little anti-social, <br /> <br />Then you will appreciate this CD. <br /> <br /> <br />1. OD (3/5) - Decent opening track, a little dramatic. <br /> <br />2. Get your Gun (5/5) - Rapid and toothsome, should have been the opening track in my opinion. <br /> <br />3. The Joy Decoys are Coming (5/5)- Great track, starts fast then immediately drops the tempo and the bass kicks hard. Lyrics are about corruption, and they are artistic and venomous. <br /> <br />4. Suicide Soundtrack (5/5) - GO FIGHT KILL GO FIGHT KILL GO FIGHT KILL GO FIGHT KILL <br /> <br />5. Life Support (2/5) - IMO the weakest track on the album. The chorus is still really cool though. <br /> <br />6. Dead America (4/5) - ominous and dangerous, slower than the tracks so far. <br /> <br />7. Sinning by your Side (6/5) - Awesome song, captures the fervor and insanity of dysfunctional romance. <br /> <br />8. Nymphoteens (6/5) - Starts out with just a beat and distorted vocals, builds quickly and explodes, chorus is harmonious but still very very dark. <br /> <br />9. Human Pollen (4/5) - slow and dreary like an amphetamine hangover but with a nice distorted beat in the background <br /> <br />10. Lie.Fake.Money-Make. (4/5) - tempo switches up a little too much for me, still one of the best tracks on the album. <br /> <br />11. Florescent Sunshine (5/5) - Unbelievable. Lyrics are about society and how your job and bank account defines who you are. Intense and desperate and cynical. <br /> <br />12. No one's getting out alive (3/5) - Fast and intense but not particularly memorable. <br /> <br />13. The Mannequin Campaign (6/5) -This is the mannequin campaign/this is the shock value refrain/for the drug addicts (yeah)/and the stoned fanatics (yeah, drugs. drugs drugs drugs drugs....) This track will make your blood move. <br /> <br />14. My Black Hole Girl (3/5) - Slow track. Lyrics about being decieved by a lover and turning numb. <br /> <br />15. Untitled (6/5) - Another instant classic. Song is about paranoid violent state of mind in America today. Lyrics - The antichrist is coming/to kill your young/load your firearms/because security/is a warm, warm gun/ <br /> <br />16. You're my Fix (5/5) - Awesome slow track, great way to end the album. Lyrics are about stalking a girl, referred to as Ms. Doe. <br /> <br /> <br />If you like angry music, buy this. You will not be disappointed."
1381,5,"This is one of my dozen-plus favorite albums of all time and, at 55, I have quite a memory, and 30 feet of LP's and CD's from the 20's till now from which to choose.  I heard it first in the overhead speakers of a record store in Paris when it was new, bought it on the spot, and rarely go a week without playing it again... sometimes several times. <br /> <br />This is feelin' good music.  Puts a bounce in your step and a smile on your face.  The lyrics, in French, do not when understood detract from the effect.  It's boy-band music, or so they tell me; it's a righteous bit short of disco; and it's incredibly youthful.  What more could you ask, can I ask, from vocal rock?  It's dance music as well but that does not detract from its listenability without benefit of smooth-soled shoes, a hardwood floor, and a partner.  It's not a kick in the pants, like Ethel Merman or Boston; a nostalgic cry, like Cole Porter doing his own stuff or Susannah McCorkle; or stomping forceful like Donna Summer or The Village People.  Nor is it the cry of youth like The Association or Britney Spears.  And it packs more push into a track than Glenn Miller or Sarah Vaughn at their most strident.  And the Back Street Boys are paler... much paler.  These folks sit somewhere in the middle of all that.  And an odd, but most pleasant, place it is. <br /> <br />There is a second album, not available in the US I guess, that is almost as good: \\""Musics\\"". <br /> <br />I listen to music for sound and this one has it.  Just about the best get-up-in-the-morning music I know.  And the best sit down with a beer and kick back music.  Works well as a surprise at parties with a mixed crew as well.  Took it to a book-signing last month and folks (the older) thought it was a lost disco masterpiece or (the younger) something brand new.  Hard to pin down save that it should be played fairly loud and with the balance controls flat.  The guys who mixed this new what they were doing. <br /> <br />Sorry these folks sank without notice.  If you have info let me know."
1382,2,"I really like Shady I have all his cd's and love them all except this one.This is just horrible,i first read other peoples reviews first but it didnt matter i still bought it should have listened to the other reviewers complaints.This album has no substance,where that Em.spirit,anger,attitude what ever it is his had in the past.There is only a couple of good songs on here one you have probaly heard 1000 times on radio already,its time for shady to step aside and let Buck,50,and Banks take over album releases while shady produces like Dr.Dre does now with some cameo's in some songs I just believe Eminem has run out of material...Really how long can all his songs be either about Kim,Hailey,his mom or his srewed up past,it was intresting the first few go arounds now its just old..."
1383,5,"What a great opportunity for me to listen to a group that I had not heard before and then share it with you all. <br />I am not a musician but an appreciator of Celtic/Irish/Scots music. It is all I listen to these days.  <br />What a lovely sound the Browne sisters make with their music, the adding the voice of George Cavanaugh as well as others who contributed to this CD.. I would be hard put to pick a favorite from this group of songs. They are all very well done.  <br />I just hope that one day the Browne Sisters and George C. will make it to Texas so I can see them live.  This is a excellent CD.."
1384,5,this cd is so tight man cham is a genius and[...]. this is a really hard hitting cd i think i underpaid this cd becuase it's so good 3 disk and there is this tight song with kanye west on it check this cd out and you will see what i mean
1385,4,"The gospel roots of the Oak Ridge Boys run pretty deep, and this disc is a fine representation of their best work in the band's mid-1960s incarnation as Southern Gospel modernists, mixing the vocal tradition of the Blackwood Brothers with the electrified bounce of Buck Owens and the West Coast honkytonk-pop scene.  This 18-song disc gathers material from several albums on the Skylite label, 1965's \\""I Wouldn't Take Nothing For My Journey Now,\\"" \\""River Of Life\\"" and \\""Solid Gospel Sound,\\"" from 1966.  Some of the songs are a bit sleepy and barbershoppish, but others have a surprisingly vigorous country sound; country fans may be surprised to find how engaging some of this material can be... There were major personnel shifts before the Boys broke into Country mainstream: the now-familiar low, deep bass rumble of singer Richard Sterben wouldn't be added into the mix until 1972, and it was probably his voice more than anything else that cemented the Oak Ridge sound as most folks remember it.  Still, you can hear the roots of that sound here, and Southern Gospel fans should be thrilled by such a nice, compact reissue of their old, religious material."
1386,4,"I found The Cheeky Cheese to be splendid. Its oddly refreshing, but I can see where the majority may find it pointless. This is definitely an acquired taste, like Guinness and wasabi, and will probably win over those who have the inability to close their minds to different types of music.  <br /> <br />Its essentially two gents just having fun, reading poetry, messing around with a wind organ and a guitar, and singing songs, some of which sound like actual songs, some of which are a little more on the spoken word side. Then again, when some think of spoken word they think of political or spiritual topics, rather than insects and scaffolding.  <br /> <br />But thats the beauty of it, folks. Its so random its great. It makes me laugh, makes my face crinkle in disbelief, and sticks in my head to where I say random phrases like, \\""Insects in your stars\\"", call my car a mussel horse, and tell the wait staff I would like a glass-of-Southern-Comfort.  <br /> <br />I really like the solo, well not really solo, work by Billy Childish, and Im working on getting more of Sexton Ming's music catalog. Being a person who appreciates the oddities in life, like pulling your long socks up after a long day of walking, has really opened my ears to this. Id also like to thank Misty and Bob for getting me into Billy and Sexton. <br /> <br />Anywho, if you have an open mind, or even if you think you do, check this out and see how much farther you can open it."
1387,3,"The first studio album in four years for Lisa Stansfield finds the UK diva veering a ways from her typical mix of blue-eyed soul-pop, with varying degrees of success.  The opening double shot of \\""Easier\\"" and \\""Treat Me Like A Woman\\"" easily  outdistances anything else on the record, though there are a few more solid tunes in the form of \\""When Love Breaks Down\\"", \\""Lay Your Hands On Me\\"", and \\""If I Hadn't Got You\\""(the one song that sounds closest to alot of her previous work).  There's an overriding pop feel to the whole album(in addition to much of the material being from outside writers), probably due largely to the switch in producers from husband Ian Devaney to Trevor Horn. That said, she stills sounds world-class throughout, and though it's not her strongest studio effort(and not as good as the previous FACE UP), it's still better by miles than its DOA position on the UK album chart suggests."
1388,4,"Allison Moorer cannot be pigeonholed.  Sure she is from Nashville country -- more George Jones than George Strait -- , and that breeding is clear here, especially on the fabulous One on the House.  But there is a lot more as well, including blues-infused tunes that could easily have come from the harder edged section of Bonnie Raitt's songbook (e.g All Aboard, a sour twist on cheap patriotism).  An almost pop sound bounces through When Will You Ever Come Down, one of the weaker cuts, with lyrics that belie the upbeat music.  Sing Me to Sleep, a uplifting lullaby at the end of life, has an Appalachian feel to it.  Baby Dreamer, kicked off with the wonderful lyric \\""There's a foreign movie/Up on your silver screen..\\"", is a torchy rock ballad.  <br /> <br />Along with the impressive array of musical styles, Moorer's intelligent and mature lyrics convey tales of human struggle and, often, hard-fought failure.  Best of all is the title track and its loss of faith sung to a stark piano and harmonica backing. Her voice, by the way, reminds me a lot of Maria McKee.  It's one powerful instrument. <br /> <br />The Duel impresses more with each complete listening -- and it is an album meant for hearing in its entirety at one sitting.  A few more months and it might be five stars; for now the couple of humdrum tunes among the superb ones keep it at four."
1389,1,"Quick ! Someone get me a tourniquet, I just slit my wrists after hearing a few cuts off this tragic discharge. Congatulations boys ! You have just fused the sounds of Eminem , Toto , and Ben Folds Five, I did not think that was possible. Moron 5 is finding old ways to offend the intelligent while stealing money from the ignorant , a feat not easily obtained! Come one and come all to see these dorks belt out some hard driving regurgitated Billy Joel type melodies .    This music is trite and belongs on a commercial for panty hose. I am endlessly amazed at the music industry's lack of scope and artistic integrity . This is the Archie's with better recording technology . No soul , No vision . Hey - where's that tourniquet?"
1390,5,"Unlike other reviewers I'm not a connoisseur of Bix Beiderbecke's work, so I had no preconceived idea of how this music should sound. Not a purist, I just find the music delightful on its own merits. I've been a fan of Geoff Muldaur's remarkable voice since his early days with the Jim Kweskin Jug Band. After a long hiatus from performing and recording, he came back strong in 1998 and 2000 with Secret Handshake and Password. Ive seen him perform twice in the past couple of years.  It's obvious that he has taken very good care of his voice, his musical tastes are eclectic but impeccable, and he's quite a musical historian. Private Astronomy is Muldaur's conceptualization of Beiderbecke's music.  He assembled an exceptional group of classical and jazz musicians for the Beiderbecke instrumentals.  Interspersed with the instrumentals are songs by other composers of the era (including Jimmy McHugh and Irving Berlin).  I like the mixture of vocals and instrumentals.  It adds diversity and eliminates the potential monotony of unrelieved instrumentals.  The total effect is lovely and evocative of the Art Deco/Prohibition era.  Muldaur's beautiful solos on \\""Waiting at the End of the Road\\"" and \\""Clouds\\"" are poignant.  He also sings as part of the Harmony Boys trio (with Loudon Wainwright III and Greg Prestopino)on \\""Take Your Tomorrow\\"" and \\""Futuristic Rhythm\\"", both upbeat, joyful tunes.  Martha Wainwright gives a spot on performance of \\""There Ain't No Sweet Man That's Worth the Salt of My Tears\\"".  I hit the replay button every time I hear it.  Her second solo, \\""Singin' the Blues\\"", is less perfect, with some uneveness in her intonation and vocal quality.  \\""There Ain't No Sweet Man\\"" is definitely the better performance.  A particular delight is Loudon Wainwright's high energy performance of \\""Bless You Sister\\"" backed by the Harmony Girls (Martha Wainwright, and Geoff Muldaur's daughters).  When I listen to it in the car it makes me want to roll down the windows and open the sun roof. I highly recommend this recording"
1391,5,"After a largely dissappointing and crappy effort from his first No Limit CD (\\""Da Game Is To be Sold Not To be told\\"") Snoop returns with a banger (I'd give it 4.5 stars if they had it but they don't - but it definately deserves more than a 4).  He returns to his west coast producers for a decent amount of the tracks and leans away from the No Limit tradition of having at least one of their artists on every single track (only 3 of the songs on the album feature No Limit Artists & he has quite a few of his old homies on here as well).  It has 3 classics, 2 near classics, 5 ok songs, 3 I skip and the rest are good.  Production is mostly non-No Limit, Meech Wells (6 songs), Dr. Dre & Dj Quik (3 songs each), KLC (2 songs), and 1 song each by Jelly Roll, Bud'da, Ant Banks, Raphael Saadiq, Goldie Loc.  A definate cd to have for any Snoop fan or rap fan has a few classic songs on it.    #2 - 8.5 (f/ Sticky Fingaz)  #3 - 8.5 (f/ Suga Free  & Sylk E.

1392,5,"for all l'arc fans, it's great to have this new album released. this album is kind of different from any of their previous ones.  <br />i won't say this album is the best one. however, as a famous and successful band, they still keep trying something new, instead of simply repeating. i feel so proud of being a l'arc fan."
1393,5,"For all you temperament lovers out there, this recording was made using the Tr&ouml;chtelborn organ restored in Kellner's reconstruction of Bach's temperament.<br /><br />For more information about this organ, go to [...]<br /><br />For more information on Kellner's Bach temperament, go to his site: [...]<br /><br />There's no information about temperament in the CD sleeve."
1394,4,"I really don't seem to find some great feel good songs in the industry right now. Nevertheless, there is always a surpriser that does come out. For Joss Stone, she really pulled a down to Earth rabbit out of her hat. Her song, Super Duper Love (Are You Diggin' On Me), the second track from her debut album, The Soul Sessions is a very soulful and upbeat pop song. It really is just one of the ose feel good songs that you really don't find anymore. The song is much better than her first single, Fell In Love With A Boy. The song is really very groovy, and just easy to dance to. This is the kind of groove that Joss needs to keep making, a feel-good vibe. It isn't there a from a a lot of others right now."
1395,5,"The 3rd Bush album,can't say I really rushed out to buy it so many years ago,cause I got word Bush went techno.Although,I should have known better,Bush could never ruin their sound.    1.

No matter what state of mind you are in,this is a great album to listen to."
1396,5,Great new sound from Utada I highly recommend this CD its vary unique and she has a beautiful voice. It is definitely different from her usual Japanese songs but still vary good.
1397,5,"I like this CD very much. It took me awhile to get used to the fast pace. The foot falls are crisp and fast paced. They're about twice as fast as the Running with Marines CD; However, I wish they would include more melodic cadences such Captian Jack and Rolling, Rolling, Rolling which are included on this CD. If you're a beginner, I suggest getting something like the Running With Marines CD. It took me two weeks of running with the Running With Rangers 2 CD to work through shin splints - and I've been running with the Running with Marines CD for a few years. I now enjoy the faster pace."
1398,5,IT WAS FAIRLY BLIND FAITH THAT CAUSED ME TO BUY THIS CD.  I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN EXPOSED TO NAT KING COLE'S MUSIC THRU MY MOM AND GRANDMOTHER.  I WONDERED WHAT A LIVE RECORDING OF NAT'S WOULD SOUND LIKE AND I AM VERY HAPPY I PURCHASED THIS CD.   <br /> <br />MY FAVORTIE TRACK IS 'MR. COLE WON'T ROCK & ROLL'.  IT IS HILARIOUS TO HEAR 'MONA LISA' & 'NATURE BOY' SANG WITH A 50'S-60'S ROCK BEAT:) THE AUDIENCE IS LOVING EVERY MOMENT OF IT TOO!!!   <br /> <br />VERY GOOD THAT SOMEONE THOUGHT TO REISSUE THIS CD FOR THOSE OF US WHO ENJOY THE MUSIC OF OUR PARENTS ERA.  ITS A GOOD CD!!
1399,4,"This is a great intro CD to anyone not familiar with the genre... You should safely assume that if you like the music on this CD you will definitely like the individual CDs by any of the artists on it.. \\""Scorpion\\"" and \\""Don Quixote\\"" are great, lively tracks you will love listening to with the sunroof open on a sunny day..."
1400,5,This is a great soundtrack. A perfect compliment to the film. I came across a site that has a version of the soundtrack that is remixed with hip hop and electronic beats. Pretty cool. hereiselsewhere.com
1401,1,"La musica de Victor Manuelle es floja y no se puede clasificar como Salsa. En realidad es un sonsonete recyclado en cada disco. Como instructor de baile de salsa puedo decir que las personas se frustran tratando de bailar salsa con la musica de Victor Manuelle. Les digo que si quieren escuchar y bailar buena Salsa escogan la musica de la Sonora Poncena, Willie Rosario y El Gran Combo entre otros..........Eso si es musica de verdad......."
1402,2,"The only song on this cd that sounds like traditional GOOD Green Day is American Idiot...a good song with awesome lyrics that reflect what anyone could see is going wrong with America through the media....but the rest of the album is ballads!!! Green Day are a punk rock band, descendants of the Ramones...so why do they have to make a concept album? Rock N Roll isnt brain surgery and if they had stuck to their working formula this album would be absolutely kick-ass just like every other album from them. I'm not saying that I want the same album over and over again...Green Day doesnt do that. I mean Warning had slow mellow songs but it worked and it was quirky(like Misery). I love that album. But for the first time since the beginning I am disappointed. Hopefully next time they will make another Punk Rock record minus the piano and ballad sound. Stick to the good stuff, dont buy this one this time around."
1403,2,"I know Murmur's listed in many a \\""best album of the 80's\\"" list, if not \\""best ever,\\"" I know it was a breakthrough for a particularly progressive sound, I know people worship at the temple of Michael Stipe, but I HATE this album.  We've all got one - that album that everyone tells you is brilliant, but does absolutely nothing for you.  This is mine, an album that provokes near violent reactions in me (\\""Radio Free Europe\\"" excluded).  Stipe to me has a snoozy, self-loving vocal ability that borders on pompousity often, and the production is soporific at best, full of its own low-fi eagerness.  Songs like \\""Moral Kiosk\\"" are preachy, poorly constructed, and don't age well - this song sounds like it was made in the early 80's by people who thought they were revolutionary.  They may have been right - now, it only recalls 100 more interesting albums that came after its release."
1404,3,"Ok, first of the bat, as soon as you look at this page, 6 reviews pop up, 3 positive, 2 negative and one in between. Browsing through the pages of other reviews, it's interesting to see that alot of the reviews (sensibly, not mindlessly) giving negative opinions on this album are not completely bashed with 'No' votes like usual, proving that it's common knowledge with Morbid Angel fans that this cd isnt totally fantastic. Just as slayerdude said, there are some great songs and there are some songs that are totally unlistenable. Of the 11 songs here 3 or 4 are great and a few are ok, the rest are very boring and uninspired. The vocals are ok, one dimensional but deep..... no where NEAR as good as Dave Vincent though of course! The backup vocals are terrible, I'm beggining (well not really beginning..) to see why Trey Azagthoth is a guitarist. Speaking of the music, the first thing that will hit you when you hear this album is the drumming.... Pete Sandoval plays lovely, smooth double bass and the production gives it a perfect tone and balances everything out so nothing is really overshadowed (except for the bass). Pete is the standout here, he is absolutely awesome (as usual). Trey and Erik don't play anything outstanding, but the solos are (as always) awesome. As I said, Steve sounds one dimensional but decent and his bass is too hard to distinguish correctly. <br /> <br />Morbid Angel over the last few albums hasn't been at all up to scratch, as my title states, its hard to accept.... that this is the same Trey Azagthoth that wrote the masterpiece Covenant (Erik Rutan wrote a fair song here though!). If you're just getting into Morbid Angel, get Covenant for sure. If you're a long time Morbid Angel fan, this is optional, but if you're a casual fan of the band, don't bother."
1405,1,"I love the beastie boys...i think i've listened to their older stuff over and over again since I was 10...but this CD is pathetic...people complain about seperation of church and state...how bout seperation of entertainment and state?  I'm all for freedom of speech, but don't sell a CD citing it as \\""entertainment\\"" when it holds a clear political agenda. <br /> <br />Lets assume there are no political messages.  I'd still rate it 1 star.  EVERY SONG SOUNDS THE SAME.  There is no varaition which the Beastie Boys have been so well known for.  Where are the rhythmic instrumentals that last for minutes on end?  Where is the innovation in musical style that had, previous to this album, been their hallmark? Seeing as how they had years to develop this album i'm rather disappointed. <br /> <br />If this is in anyway a hint as to what future Beastie Boys albums will sound like, you can count me out."
1406,5,"This album was a change of pace from all of the other soul albums of that day (heavier emphasis on lead guitar, covers of songs made famous by pop and country artists). It is awesome, especially their remake of \\""It's Too Late.\\"" A must for any true Isleys fan!"
1407,1,"Before the whole grunge scene that took place in the early ninties the charts were dominated by Guns N' Roses and glam rockers. The latter part of the eighties soon died out with The Black Album (Metallica), Nevermind (Nirvana) and Ten (Pearl Jam) and with these albums real music came back like in the seventies. After Kurt Cobain commited suicide in '94 all hell broke loose and ten years later we've still gotten nowhere. This album was trying very hard to bring back the glam rock of the New York Dolls and such and with this travesty, along with the killers 'Hot Fuss' it wasn't going to happen. What these two albums have in common is lack of diversity, terrible vocals and stupid lyrics, not to mention bad basslines. But what makes this album worse than 'Hot Fuss' is the very crappy production. Oh yeah and did I mention that every song is just twice as bad as the last? Yeah if you thought 'Buck Shelf' (Or whatever the hell its called) was bad enough than just wait til' the next song comes. Once you hit the fifth song you will actually feel like your in the center of hell. Dont buy this, like I said Nirvana happened for a reason."
1408,5,"For some reason some reviewers I've read on amazon seem to have a problem with Vespertine. I have been following Bjork's career since I was a kid listening to the Sugarcubes and I generally think her solo albums have progressed for the better. Homogenic was an undeniable classic and, for me, Vesperine was the next logical step. It's an incredible record. Perhaps less accesible than her previous efforts, but artistically just incredible. Matmos did a beautiful job complimenting her work and they bring a more minimal IDM feel to the beats than Mark Bell or Graham Massey, etc. Should there be any doubt that Vespertine is a triumph, this live CD should put all of it to rest. I got this CD as a part of the live box and I consider it the crowning jewel of that set. This album actually comes across better live in my opinion. The lengths she went to in order to reproduce this record are very respectable. A full orchestra, an inuit choir, and matmos creating beats by among other things mic-ing shuffling cards or stepping on crushed salt. The live version of Vespertine is really exquisite. Even \\""Hidden Place\\"" which is my least favorite song on Vespertine comes across much better live. And the CD reaches its peak from there. The last few tracks are mind-blowing. The live version of \\""Harm of Will\\"" brings me to tears and is one of the best examples of Bjork's outstanding vocal range I've ever heard. Among live versions of songs from Vespertine are incredible renditions of \\""Unravel\\"" and \\""All is Full of Love.\\"" This is a must for any Bjork fan. Anyone skeptical about Vespertine should really hear this CD, it may change your mind."
1409,5,"i agree with \\""A music fan\\"". it's raw album but that's why it's so cool. exactly, modest mouse are'nt (and i hope they won't be) a mtv pop band. you should bear this in your mind. trust me, this is \\""rare\\"", unique album. if you want to hear true modest mouse, listen to this."
1410,3,"The inclusion of \\""Life's Been Good to Me\\"" and \\""A Man Alone\\"" would, by themselves, make this album worthy of purchase.  I probably could do without the spoken pieces, although they're not bad. <br /> <br />I would probably rank this album 6th among Sinatra's Reprise albums, behind \\""September of My Years\\"" (at #1), \\""Sinatra and Strings,\\"" \\""The Concert Sinatra,\\"" \\""Sinatra Sings Great Songs From Great Britain,\\"" and \\""Sinatra-Basie.\\"" <br /> <br />It's a travesty that the only \\""greatest hits\\"" compilations that contain the aforementioned \\""Love's Been Good to Me\\"" are also imports."
1411,4,"Within the past year, Blue Note has reissued a number of classic Dexter Gordon albums via its RVG series including \\""Doin' Allright,\\"" \\""Dexter Calling\\"" and \\""Our Man in Paris\\"" (see my reviews).  EMI continues this trend with this CD, a remastered version of \\""One Flight Up.\\"" Originally recorded in Paris, Dex's June 2, 1964 effort was made, not under the watchful eye of Alfred Lion and Rudy Van Gelder, but instead by business partner Francis Wolff.  It features the great tenor saxophonist in a quintet setting with trumpeter Donald Byrd, pianist Kenny Drew, bassist Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen, and drummer Art Taylor.  The album's centerpieces are two extended compositions, Donald Byrd's \\""Tanya\\"" and Kenny Drew's \\""Coppin' The Haven,\\"" both of which are, in my opinion, an attempt to follow-up on the success of Herbie Hancock's \\""Takin' Off,\\"" where Dex put in a rare appearance as a sideman.  It is a combination that is enjoyable, but the second time around it doesn't seem altogether tailor-made for Dex's sound, particularly now that he is in the leadership role.  In fact, he seems more himself on the standard \\""Darn That Dream\\"" and his own \\""Kong Neptune,\\"" a bonus track not included on the original LP (but featured on the first CD incarnation of this album).  One wonders if Lion didn't feel the same way, as the following year he brought Gordon back to the States to record his next Blue Note sessions, \\""Gettin' Around\\"" and what would eventually be released as \\""Clubhouse.\\""  In all, \\""One Flight Up\\"" is a perfectly good jazz disc, but it is definitely one step down from the likes of \\""A Swingin' Affair\\"" and \\""Go.\\"""
1412,1,"This album, from start to finish, is the sound of a beat box falling down the stairs.  It stumbles, it crashes, and it finally ends with blissful silence.  There is no melody or rhythm, just a garbled bunch of nonsense looped over and over, track after track.  If \\""music\\"" this amateurish is making the grade and being published on Warp Records, I'm going to buy my three year old daughter and drum machine and make millions off of her lack of talent.  Save your money!"
1413,5,"I suppose everyone is entitled to their opinion but I can't resist pointing out to the previous reviewer that there are four MP3 songs available for download so it would've been very easy to hear good quality versions of the tracks prior to purchasing.   <br /> <br />Something suspicious about this review from M. Sparkman AKA \\""Infaustus\\"". Everyone else-have a listen and make up your own mind!"
1414,5,"Lauren Christy offer to us her second deliver where she rock this time, she goes wild, crazy and sexual, and still doesnt loose her natural charm, with lyrics full of sexual connotations such as the opening \\""breed\\"" \\""let the rain come down on me\\"" she claims for her desire of give ligth , album sleeve is also very suggestive she is all sorrounded by rabbits wich seems to explain her sensual feelings, \\""magazine\\"" talks about a world full of consumers and fashion victims, \\""you make me laugh\\"" is a song about sex in couples but with relaxed and funny ideas. <br />like this, the rest of the song are very personnal, but all of us can feel related in one or other sense, I hope Lauren release in the near future a third album , I dont want to die without taste again her fabulous songs <br />HM"
1415,1,"Perry's great, but this is a horrible sounding CD.  I guess it may be worth it if all you have is an old beat up LP, but this really is a tragedy.  Shame on you Collectibles and BMG."
1416,5,"The single was hot.  I like the cd, Fat joe is a great artist I enjoyed listening to the album. Remy also did her thing on this one. Go out there and get it."
1417,4,"Very nice archive live recording of a gig the band played at the Hartford Civic Center. It was assembled by tape archivist Dick Latvala. I've never really been THAT big of a Dead fan, but I've always enjoyed Jerry Garcia's (R.I.P.) guitar playing. The tunes I liked the best on this 3-CD release are &#34;Althea&#34;, &#34;Fire On The Mountain&#34;, and the rocking &#34;The Other One&#34;. The lengthy tracks &#34;Eyes Of The World&#34; and &#34;Scarlet Begonias&#34; are very well played as is Mickey Hart's drum solo at the start of disc three. Other notable cuts are &#34;Alabama Getaway&#34;, &#34;C. C. Rider&#34;, &#34;Keep Your Day Job&#34; and the encore &#34;U. S. Blues&#34;. The original 'jam band' is hard at work as one can truly experience here. Would make a swell gift for any Deadhead that doesn't already own a copy."
1418,5,"If your children like the Playhouse Disney show Lights, Camera, Action, Wiggles, then they'll love this CD. This \\""soundtrack\\"" has all the music that's original to the show plus some. My four year old son loves it. And so do I."
1419,1,"I am a big fan of Smith and of The Fall - one of the great rock and roll bands, ever.  But this album, which strips the garage-rock trappings away from his somewhat pretentious poetic ramblings, is truly horrible.  Definitely this is one of the worst and least musical projects ever committed to record, reminding me only of Robert Wyatt's unbelievably bad \\""The End of an Ear\\"". <br />"
1420,4,"As an orginal Dave Brubeck fan and one who met him and the quartet several times, I have to admit I'm disappointed at this album.  The CD is a very good jazz album; it's just not a very good Dave Brubeck one.  Even though it's live from the Blue Note in 1993, Dave sounds rather lackluster.  Bobby Militello is in no way shape or form any comparison to Paul Desmond; in fact, I find too much of a \\""fish horn\\"" quality to his playing.  Bill Smith does an admirable job on clarinet and the rest of the crew are good. There's good jazz on this CD, but I think I'll donate the CD to the local library."
1421,5,<br />    Kerplunk and Dookie were then the Golden Age of Green Day. <br />  if you think newer green day is better then your just wrong.    <br />   In other words my mind works correctly and yours doesnt. Kerplunk kicks ass wether you like it or not. So just go listen to Nick Carter and suck your thumb in the corner.
1422,5,"as gloomy a life as this can sometimes be, i'm happy to have minikon on my side. after falling in love with the cute website, reading 10+ raving articles, and listening to about a minute and a half's worth of song clips, i took a chance. one of the reviewers claimed that listening to this while walking down the street made him want to jump headfirst into bricks to find golden coins and gain bonus points. it turns your life into a video game, with the best music possible. i must have listened to it 3 or 4 times the day i got it (something i never do). it's my first IDM (intelligent dance music) purchase, a new genre i had been keeping my distance from. but this, this is just delightful."
1423,5,"This album is a subtle masterpiece. I've had it for years, and I appreciate it more every time I listen. Very emotional, melodic. The songs are melancholy but hopeful. It's a bit like looking wistfully back on childhood dreams that have been lost among pressing adult concerns. The album is often run down, described as &quot;pretty good dance music&quot;. If you listen, you may see past this surface. Give it a try :)"
1424,1,"now,mind you....if anyone besides me can remember a time earlier this year when Slipknot said that this album was going to be a SLIPKNOT album....you'd agree that this is just &quot;StoneSour #2&quot; <br />  <br /> that being said...the only good tracks on here are,&quot;&quot;Before I Forget&quot; & &quot;Welcome&quot;.The rest of this of this album just drones on,and seems to go in a systematical cycle.Corey sings,Corey Talks,Corey Screams.One pleasent surprise is that there IS guitar solos...and I'm proud of them for making that step.But however that still does not balance things.Songs like &quot;3 Nil&quot;,&quot;Ver Million&quot;,and &quot;Prelude 3.0&quot; are total peices of crap,while songs like &quot;Pulse of the Maggots&quot;,&quot;Danger:Keep Away!&quot;,and &quot;Ver Million PT.2&quot; sound like they were written in 10 minutes,while the band members were stoned (-no pun intended-) sour.So don't waste your $17.00 bucks on this drivel,there are more bands worthy of praise for their offerings this year,like Fear Factory,Demon Hunter,and Killswitch Engage. <br />  <br /> If you do buy it,you'll want to burn it & bury it within 15 minutes."
1425,1,"This album sucks!  The 3 new tracks sounds like Van Hagar are  now influenced by Nu-Metal.  Why can't they release their live Concert from California with Roth in 83 on DVD?  Hagar's song writing is crap.  He never was able to keep the cheeky song writing of Roth.  In fact I'd recommend Roth's 'best of' album in comparison to this, because the guitaring for starters is better.  Like previous reviews anyway, weve already had one 'best of' album, so why another?  Warner Brothers just wanna keep the money flowing in. Also I noticed when listening to some parts of this CD that the sound stops occasionally, so the CD is flawed.  Overall, if you are a Van Hagar fan, buy it.  But if you are a little weary of listening to the same VH tracks over and over again, avoid!"
1426,5,"If you have not listened/purchased Danzig I and II yet, might I suggest that you do that BEFORE purchasing 'How the Gods Kill'.  This album is a classic all on it's own, but I think you will appreciate it that much more if you can hear the evolution of Danzig's (the man and the band) musical direction.  'How the Gods Kill' offers some of the most powerful, creepy and soul stirring music you'll ever hear, w/in the metal/rock genre and frankly any style.  To the casual listener (and the unenlightened) Danzig appears dark and Satanic, for the sake of being dark and Satanic.  The music and subject matter is certainly dark, but the Satanic label is applied much to easily to a band and a man that, certainly does not regularly attend church, but is merely exploring and questioning the darker side of reality, NOT worshiping or promoting it.  If you want to hear REAL Satanic music listen to DEICIDE or CRADLE OF FILTH, you'll find them quite juvenille both musically and philisophically compared to DANZIG.  'How the Gods Kill', in my opinion, represents DANZIG at it's/his peak.  The music is purposeful and well crafted, every song stands alone yet all are tied together in a significant way.  From the powerful pulse of 'Godless', the dark and beautiful title track (one of the most powerful songs ever written/recorded), to the delicate sappiness of 'Sistinas' this album is a must have for any rock/blues/metal fan.  If you have already been exposed to some of Danzig's music and are truly intriged by what you've heard, do yourself a favor and purchase the MISFITS boxed set, SAMHAIN boxed set, and every Danizg album up to 4p.  Listen to them in that order and you will have heard one of the greatest, most powerful, misunderstood, and underappreciated musical forces of all time."
1427,2,"Howard Shore had an immense undertaking for this project, and his final score is decent. The dark and ominous themes for full orchestra and chorus are effective in the movie, though somewhat contrived an un-original. Speaking of un-orginial, the other famous themes have their origins elsewhere as well. The triumphant Fellowship Theme can be heard during football season as the NFL Sunday Night TV theme. Crack open a hymnal and find &quot;This is My Father's World,&quot; whose first phrase is lifted directly for the Hobbit's theme. <br /> Aside from those disappointing steals, Shore does a good job with the background music to this movie. I would recommend this to fans of the movie, but not fans of original motion picture music. Don't get me wrong, it isn't terrible at all. However, I would not call this Academy-Award winning material by any means. Just a pretty good album."
1428,5,"I started listenin to devin when i first heard him on the chronic album with snoop and dre, and i knew he must be a bad dude.  And this album is no different its just bad, not as good as the dude but its defently a good investment."
1429,5,"I used to date A beautiful black woman who turned me on to Dinah Washington A few years ago, and it was this album she played for me I couldn;t believe my ears I heard her voice it was so cool. I really like trouble in the lowlands and soft winds.I found out later that this album was out of print but I found A used copy on Amazon thank God.If you like great female jazz and blues singing I highly recomend this album. Also another 2 albums to get are Dinah Jams and Dinah 62."
1430,5,"If you like Linkin Park, hey, whatever floats your boat. They suck, but if you like them, more power to you. But to have the audacity to write a long critical review in which you spend time comparing Linkin Park to the Deftones and saying that the Deftones will be &quot;gone by Wednesday,&quot; is so much garbage. I think the &quot;gone by Wednesday&quot; thing can definately be said for Linkin Park. 15 years down the road, no one is going to care about them. The Deftone's have been releasing albums for ten years now and have been around as a band a lot longer. They're obviously doing SOMETHING write in order to get such a huge underground fan base and sky-rocketing sales.<BR>I also like the thing that Dr. Music said about the Deftones trying to sound heavier on this album than they have before. He says it as though it's some sort of negative slump to the music among many. You know what? Deftones are a heavy band, dude, and that's what heavy bands do. They get HEAVIER! And the good ones like the Deftones switch things up a little bit and try something different. I think that maybe Dr. Music would like Deftones a little more if they tried some of the musical &quot;genius&quot; of Linkin Park's approach, (i.e.) have a crappy rapper for every verse with lyrics that sound like &quot;I don't know why i'm not liked, you didn't see me you didn't recognize, understand why when i cry, didn't even know when i tried to hide, doesn't make sense&quot; and blah, blah, shoot me, while after that, for the chorus, some pimply white kid cryptically whines about how no one liked him in High School. The Deftones would also need to start dressing like gangsters and dying their hair stupid colors, or saying cliche crap like &quot;our songs mean whatever you want them to mean&quot; unlike they do, or shout at their concerts that they love Janes Addiction just to sound cultured, or start righting the most downright, beebop and catchy hooks ever.<BR>The Deftones is a wonderful album that iscomparable or philisophical comparable to any of the good rock to come out of the 70's (not in sound of course, just song structure and maybe lyrics). How could you think The Deftones are a step below Linkin Park when the Deftones have a song called Hexagram that screams with something that's not exactly anger while Chino says &quot;paint the streets in white, death is the standard breach for a complex prize; god it's so sweet of you, and your parents are proud; but i would expect it now from anyone now to protect life's indigenous sound&quot;.<BR>All in all, who cares if the Deftones don't have guitar solos? Go listen to the bands that do if that's your only signifier of good music! Who cares if they're trying to be crunchy and heavier than ever? that's the deftones! Who cares if Dr. Music doesn't like this album? It's going to last and be a favorite unlike either of Linkin Park's two cd's of complete drivel that we will all look back on and shake our heads in embarrassment that their music captured so many wannabe hardcore kids who are about 26's years old, wearing a backwards hat with their 14 year old gilfriends, walking down the street with no car. THis is the definition of the musical generation that would last if Linkin Park was going to make it, which they aren't. <BR>Dr. Music should come up with his own creative Genius and try to do better than the Deftones in his own band called PanLinkinSlayerica."
1431,5,"I bought this CD for another rendition of Grieg's concerto, but now I listen to it again and again for the Schumann; what a wonderful composition! I had not heard of Lupu until I purchased this CD, but I would now seek out other recordings of his. I highly recommend it."
1432,1,"I thought I would give it a try, but she hasn't gotten any better. Her voice is so annoying on this record. \\""Yeah Yeah\\"" is not a lyric, in my opinion. I wish her the best, but she will have to do a lot better than this if she wants to succeed in this industry."
1433,5,"A friend of mine is a somewhat-rabid Solas fan, and I finally decided to listen to soundclips of the group's music.  Am I ever glad I did.  &quot;The Edge of Silence&quot; is absolutely beautiful, a fusion of Celtic and modern music I haven't heard anywhere else (no doubt it exists, but...), and Dierdre Scanlan's voice is lovely. The album includes a few instrumental tracks--2, 4, 7, and 8--and although I enjoyed those I liked the other songs a bit better."
1434,5,"I was recently on vacation in Puerto Rico and wanted to buy some CD's for the rental car. The only two cd's in the store worth buying were Janet Jackson's Design of a Decade and Bjork's &quot;Debut&quot;. I listended to both CD's throughout my trip. I have been a Janet Jackson fan for sometime, but Bjork got under my skin on this trip. I am now a full-fledged fanatic. I never realized that almost all of Bjork's songs are love songs. The only remote comparison I can make of her is like a Nordic, deconstructed, sometimes minimal, electronic Billie Holliday. She can be gloomy, elated, ecstatic, whatever. When she sings, the songs are hers.<BR>My favorite song on the CD is Isobel. Listen to Missy Elliot's &quot;Really Hot&quot; and see how ahead of her time Bjork is. The beat sequence is almost identical.<BR>Possibly, Maybe is another beauty. It hits the feeling of a breakup on the nose.<br />To all of the people who wrote bad reviews of Bjork, if you don't have something nice to say..... Bjork has been singing most of her life and experts would agree, she has a natural singing voice and an expressive and wide vocal range. Can anyone complaining make those sounds with their voices, on key no less? She knows music inside and out, and the wierd and avant garde sounds are INTENTIONAL. Besides, one has to have an acute knowledge of music to turn it inside out like that. Listen closely and you will hear the genius. Barbara Streisand has been done. We don't need anymore singers sounding like someone else.<br />Also, the videos from her DVD collection go hand in hand with the songs. You really get the true meaning and a grasp of the songs."
1435,4,"Great Mandolin playing, great songwriting...<BR>Favorites include Mr. Coolberg, bluegrass at the Beach, Argentine Trio, and Slade.<BR>Not very similar to &quot;Shady Grove&quot; and &quot;Not for Kids Only&quot; which I would also reccomend but still an awesome album<BR>Buy it!"
1436,5,"Shlomi Shabat is a fantastic artist.  This is an album of performances with other top Israeli artists.  The duets on this album are some of the best of current Israeli pop music.  The album is Oriental/Spanish style.  There are many excellent ballads on the album.  The first track, HaIshah Shel Chai'ai, with Yaron Cohen is a fantastic love song, although it is a little over played on Israeli radio. The seventh track is another wonderful love song.  This one performed with Itzik Yitzhak.  And you must have the 13th track with Pini Hadad.  If you like the Gypsy Kings, or David Broza, you will like Track 9, performed with Leah Shabat."
1437,5,"If you can find this album, buy it.  I was fortunate to get a copy, as it's out of production and quite rare, but I am very glad I did.<br />Agalloch is without doubt one of the most impressive bands on the current underground metal scene.  A lot of fools simply write them off as an Opeth ripoff, but there is NO hint of an Opeth influence in any of their music, aside from the length of the songs.  They never listed Opeth as an influence, it's always been Ulver, Sol Invictus, etc.  And in my opinion, they simply slaughter Opeth in terms of atmosphere, fluency, structures, acoustic guitar work, and vocals.  Sure, all the Opeth worshippers are going to crucify me for that statement, but I couldn't care less.  But the point is, you NEED to get rid of any preconceived notion that Agalloch and Opeth sound anything alike to enjoy this band.<br />To sum it up without blabbering, I concur with the other five-star reviewers.  Haughm's clean vocals are as good as they get in metal, and his black voice is as hollow, raspy, and cold as you can get.  The guitar work is amazing.  The only place they seem to be lacking is in the drums, and it's not really a big deal.  So, Opeth fan or not, you really should invest in an Agalloch album.<br />Highlight songs:  &quot;She Painted Fire Across the Skyline (pt. 1),&quot;  &quot;The Misshapen Steed,&quot;  &quot;Hallways of Enchanted Ebony,&quot;  &quot;As Embers Dress the Sky&quot;"
1438,5,"Fantasia is a great singer,i'm glad she won american idol diana degarmo does nothing else then scream fantasia has a GREAT voice and she's a good entertainer!!!!!Diana degarmo can't sing!!!!!"
1439,5,"this is such a god cd. Sure most of the songs on this album are really really simple, but thats what makes the ramones so great! They are the god fathers of punk (along with the clash and the sex pistols). This album has so many good tracks for such a low price you would be a fool not to buy it..."
1440,5,i am not getting enough words in my mouth or pen to praise this classic from floyd containing gems like shine on you crazy diamond.very highly recommended.
1441,5,"I somewhat like Tiesto, with his collaborations with Ferry Corsten in Gouryella, his independent productions, and of course, his records and remixes, but not to the point of exuberance. Not until I managed to pick up this album.<br /><br /> This is easily the best album that Tiesto has ever done. I was a bit underestimated, considering what I've heard on his &quot;in search of sunrise&quot; mixes. Though, I never thought this type of pure hard trance would be fashioned in a way where it could be transitioned effortlessly, and that's what Tiesto has done.<br /><br />Overall, an incredible mix by one of the Netherland's best. This reminded me of Paul Van Dyk's &quot;politics of dancing&quot; or Ferry Corsten's &quot;mixed live in spundae&quot;. Two very excellent albums that feature hard beats, big bass, and emotional downpoints. The cover's great too. It's probably the best looking cover in my collection. A great example of how fun and dark a club scene appears in an eye of a dj."
1442,5,"Before No Doubt released Tragic Kingdom they weren't well known.  They actually just released this so they could get their songs out, then they would go on with their lives.  Luckily their first single \\""Just A Girl\\"" hit well and they didn't have to do that.  Tragic Kingdom in my eyes is No Doubt's best work, filled with all good songs.  I don't there are many cd's where I happen to enjoy all hits, but this is definitely one of them.<br /><br />The cd starts of with \\""Spider Webs\\"" which is an ingenious song.  One of my favorite songs in No Doubt history is \\""Excuse Me Mr.\\"" which is just an awesome song.  Next is \\""Just A Girl\\"" which was their first single and possibly the \\""star\\"" of the cd.  Another one of my favorite songs from no doubt is \\""Different People\\"" which is just so awesome.  Then later comes their other hit from the cd, \\""Don't Speak\\"" which is still getting radio play today.  \\""You Can Do it\\"" is also a fun song, though it kinda sounds like something the Spice Girls would sing.  Then comes my favorite song on the whole cd...\\""Tragic Kingdom\\"".  It's so fun, heavy, deep, imaginative, and basically has a nice flow.<br /><br />The whole cd is just loads of fun and I would suggest it to anyone who has only heard their new stuff."
1443,5,"I read a lot of reviews on this album deciding whether or not to get it...I really didn't want to spend my $ on a sell-out weak album. But after finnally breaking and getting the album I can say that their truly are a lot of stupid people out there.<br />This album is outstanding. It's just a lot more diverse and mature. It still f-ing rocks and the slower songs are great as well. And this is coming from someone who likes it as heavy as it gets, but I also know good music when I hear it. I don't think it's quite as ground-breaking/good as self-titled(in my opinion that album alone brought back the &quot;resurgence&quot; of American metal) but it runs circles around IOWA. A great buy that is well-worth the money."
1444,3,"&quot;DAMITA JO&quot; has a few highs and lows. The best songs are &quot;Damita Jo&quot;, &quot;Exhibition&quot;, and &quot;I Want You&quot;.  There are a few other notable songs, but I think these three stand out. I personally don't care for the interludes, I think some are really silly and make the album seem somewhat boring. Some of the songs for me were just a bit on the silly side such as &quot;R&amp;B Junkie&quot;.  It is by no means a terrible album, nor by any a great one, so I give it 3 stars for being average."
1445,5,"First I want to comment on the reviewer before mine. I totally agree with what you are saying. Pj, nirvana and AIC aren't the only bands out there. However, i disagree when you say that pearl jam don't break new grounds. Pearl Jam takes new steps in different directions with every album. Pearl Jam is so often put beside nirvana and AIC because they were all grunge bands, but I think Pearl Jam is more a straight rock and roll band that deserve your attention. And this album is a good place to start.<br />This album is a classic, however it is living in the shadow of the commercial success album 'ten'. Vs sold almost 1 million copies in its first week of release. Back then, they counted 5 days as one week, making vs selling that many copies in only 5 days. Today, N'sync own the record, however, today they count all 7 days of the first week of sale. Even N'sync needed more than 5 days to beat this . Therefore the record still belongs to pearl jam in a way!<br />On to the album. <BR>The first 2 songs are go and animal,both fast rockers that an be frustrating in the first listens. <br />Daughter - Pearl Jam's first acustic song. This song is great and recieves a lot airplay on the radio. <BR>Glorified G - A fairly straight rocker with a great solo at the end. They seem to have fun.<BR>Dissident is the albums first masterpiece. A great riff with soaring lyrics and a powerful voice by Eddie. <BR>WMA - A hard first listen. It features a cool drumbeat and a haunting Eddie. The song is great and you will grow to love it. <BR>Blood - This song is heavy and craaazy with eddie screaming his loungs out for 3 minutes.<BR>Rearviewmirror - The albums second masterpiece! WOW, this song was the song that got me into pearl jam. Watch out for the finale of the song, magnificent stuff! <BR>Rats - A cool song with great bass! <BR>ELderly woman behind the counter in a small town - the albums third masterpiece. This is a concert favourite and with good reasons. The song is acustic with Eddie singing about fate. Its one of those songs everyone likes. Very catchy to be pearl jam. <BR>Leash - a rocker that was written on the road during the ten tour. Fast and heavy. Nuff said! <BR>NOW comes the greatest piece of music that has ever been recorded.<BR>Indifference - First time I heard this song I was recovering from a major hangover and I started to cry. Talk about a simple, yet POWERFUL song. Eddie's voice is so good on this track, it's unmatchable. If you don't buy this album, at least do yourself a favour and listen to this track. It an't be described in words. Only Eddie can.<br />So there you go, A great rock album with plenty of rock and many different styles. If you want to check pearl jam out (which is something you definately should do)get this album or 'ten'. Can't recommend them enough!"
1446,5,"Max Fiedler (1859-1939) is the only conductor on record who knew Brahms over a lengthy period (Weingartner performed in front of Brahms only shortly before the composer's death).  So what we have here are genuine historical artifacts of how a major conductor performed Brahms during the composer's lifetime.  These transfers are the best I have heard - they are FAR superior to what is heard in Beulah's CD set \\""Original Brahms.\\""    These interpretations are highly \\""romantic\\"" in style, with numerous \\""luftpausen\\"" and tempo shifts - Fiedler has no reluctance to slow down and \\""smell the roses\\"" when the mood seizes him.  In many respects, this mode of Brahms conducting is an early precursor to the highly \\""personal\\"" readings of Furtwangler, Abendroth, and to a certain extent, Knappertsbusch. It is certainly miles apart from the strict rectitude of Weingartner and the steady, but highly nuanced pulse of Fritz Busch.  The latter was a pupil of Fritz Steinbach, who was said to be Brahms' favorite conductor of the composer's symphonies.    The second symphony recorded here has a warmth and poetry that rank it, for me, among the finest interpretations ever, along with Furtwangler (his 1952 Berlin Phil. reading), Busch, and Schuricht (with the VPO).  The 4th strikes me as somehwat less successful:  some of the tempos drag, and several of the tempo shifts are unconvincing.  Still, a fascinating reading nevertheless.    In the 2nd Piano concerto, Fiedler provides some of the most purely beautiful orchestral playing ever heard.  To my ears, only Furtwangler (with Fischer) and Knappertsbusch (with Curzon) are in the same league.  Pianist Elly Ney was something of a cult figure in Germany. Years ago, when I first heard this reading, her playing struck me as labored and rather inept.  Perhaps I have mellowed in the mean time - while not a virtuoso, Ney does play with great feeling and is well-attuned to Fiedler's conducting.  There are quite a few wrong notes here - but Schnabel (with Boult) had even more - and in the live concert with Furtwangler, Fischer misses whole handfuls.  In the wrong notes department, the Swiss pianist wins hands down, so to speak.  Among later recordings, Gilels is certainly more fluent with Jochum - but there is a certain glibness that comes with it.    Fiedler's account of the Academic Festival Overture is rather more conventional.  A pleasure to hear, but I like Mengelberg and Knappertsbusch even more.  Music & Arts has released a lovely Brahms Violin Concerto, where Fiedler accompanies the young Siegfied Borries.  It is coupled with a very interesting reading of Schumann's \\""Spring\\"" Symphony.  Fiedler deeply admired the conducting of Hans von Bulow, who premiered important works by Brahms and Wagner.  Perhaps Fiedler's Schumann gives us some idea of how Bulow would have performed it.    This is a fine set for collectors.  It provides a useful perspective on interpretive styles that prevailed during Brahms' lifetime."
1447,5,"I agree that this is the greatest of the Ring cycles. It enshrines the perfect Brunnhilde of Astrid Varnay, and Hans Hotter in his peak as Wotan, long before his voice became woofy in Solti's famous Ring. The remastering here uses the latest technology - sound is terrific. If you like the Ring, this is IT!! By the way, this release is the best sound that I've heard of this cycle. Not to mention it is the cheapest!! With a nice long essay to boot!!"
1448,4,"Here's an e-mail and a response; PLEASE READ!!! This review is about the label not the recording. IT'S GREAT, GET IT; just not on this label. To whoever it concerns (hopefully Joel Dorn), Just wanted to let you know, if you didn't already, that the Collectables label puts 2 seconds of silence between tracks. I've bought Rahsaan Rahsaan &amp; The 3 Sided Dream and everything has 2 seconds of silence between songs that run on together. This pisses me off as I called the label &amp; they told me that's how they got the master from Atlantic! I've wasted $25 on these &amp; I have to buy them over again as I refuse to make due with these versions. How can a label sell an inferior product? Anyway, I just wanted to let you know and hope someone provides them with corrected masters. Thanks. Dave. Dave, Thanks for writing. First off, you learned the hard way to never buy anything from Collectables. They have no intention of serving the music. It's like a chop shop. Secondly, I'll pass your email along to Joel Dorn, but there is nothing whatsoever he can do about it. He hasn't worked for Atlantic records since the mid-70s. As I'm sure you know, Atlantic is owned by Warner Music Group, which up until a few months ago was part of AOL, and still remains a mega l Dorn is so far off their radar to not even be existant when it comes to the masters they issue to licensing labels for reissue. Even if he were to complain about them mis-representing his original productions, it would mean exactly nothing to them. It's a drag, but unfortunately it's the reality of the it were Rhino reissuing those records, he could have more say, but the licensing to other labels is a lost cause."
1449,5,"One of Black Label Society's most straightforward metal albums (at least one in a trilogy of them, along with STRONGER THAN DEATH and THE BLESSED HELLRIDE), this features some of Zakk Wylde's best metal work.  After a few noise effects and a strangely brutal howl, a fairly fast, rumbling riff smashes in with the intensity of a derailed train on \\""Bleed for Me,\\"" one of the most memorable songs in Black Label Society's (and Zakk's) career.<br />Black Label Society is one of the ultimate metal outfits I have ever heard; they (and by \\""they,\\"" I mean Zakk and whomever else he hires as extra help) can do it all.  There are the fast-paced, riff-based juggernauts like \\""Bleed for Me,\\"" \\""Lords of Destruction,\\"" \\""Demise of Sanity,\\"" and \\""Battering Ram.\\""  Songs like \\""Life, Birth, Blood, Doom,\\"" \\""Graveyard Disciples,\\"" \\""Refuse to Bow Down,\\"" and \\""Berserkers\\"" carry Zakk's signature chugging, lock-step rhythms.  Then there's a couple ballads/semi-ballads, including \\""Bridge to Cross,\\"" \\""Lost Heaven,\\"" and the absolutely amazing acoustic instrumental \\""America the Beautiful,\\"" which is to this day my favorite of Zakk's quieter pieces.<br />Zakk's vocal performance, as is unfortunately often the case with Black Label Society, is somewhat marred at times.  After hearing his amazing singing voice on BOOK OF SHADOW, I know he can do better than this; but then again, Black Label Society is an entirely different beast from that album.  As well, his lyrics are their usual subjects of fighting, death, war, getting drunk and/or stoned, and generally being a bada**.  However, it is ultimately the instrumental work that is Zakk's emphasis with Black Label Society, and it works.<br />Still one of my top 5 favorite guitarists, Zakk never fails to impress me, especially not on this album.  Riffs aplenty, his solos and leads here are especially vigorous and ferocious, and often trippy (just listen to the lead in the pre-chorus of \\""Lords of Destruction\\"").  Perhaps my favorite track, instrumentally, is \\""Demiseof Sanity,\\"" where he has fast riffs played in a lock-step rhythm, with simply killer bursts of distortion in the choruses.  And the solo...it nearly makes me have seizures listening to it.  Well, not really, but you know what I mean.<br />His acoustic guitar talents are fully exercised here, too, as evident on \\""Bridge to Cross,\\"" \\""Lost Heaven,\\"" and \\""America the Beautiful.\\""  He puts such soul and nice grooves into the strums and finger-picking, it really is some amazing stuff.  Again, for more of this, check out BOOK OF SHADOWS.  And yes, he has one of his little acoustic guitar solos, which might not be much, but sure show off his talent.<br />Finally, the hired musicians: Craig Nunemacher, longtime drummer for Crowbar, once again lends his excellent talents to Black Label Society.  However, on several tracks (\\""Bleed for Me,\\"" \\""Demise of Sanity,\\"" and \\""Life, Birth, Blood, Doom\\"") someone known as Christian Werr is the muscle behind the percussion.  Whoever he is, he is quite good.  Also, on \\""Demise\\"" and \\""Life...\\"" is featured Robert Trujillo, currently the bassist for Metallica and formerly of Suicidal Tendencies and Ozzy.  He adds a nice, funky sort of groove to the work, and really has a good stage presence.  His work will be missed.<br />And...that's it.  For an ultimately good, old-fashioned heavy metal album, check out Black Label Society's 1919 ETERNAL.  Just don't headbang too hard."
1450,5,"Bethany's voice is absolutely mellefluous. At only 15 years old, she is far better than any professional adult vocalists I have heard in a  long time. What makes this CD even better is knowing that young Bethany writes her own lyrics and plays all the acoustic guitar parts by herself. This album is professionally done and sounds just as good as any you will find. There are many outstanding songs on this one CD and since I obtained it one week I ago I haven't been able to put it down; it's defainatly become one of my all-time favorites. This is one of those CDs that you can just keep listening to the songs and they never wear out! The lyrics are so encouraging and GREAT for the adolecsent Christian girl. <br />My favorites are: #1, #3, #5, #6, and #7 <br />BUY THIS CD!"
1451,5,"By the time Josephine Baker performed in Fidel Castro's Cuba in 1966, she was both a seasoned artist and a financially desperate woman.  Battling foreclosure on her chateau, and eviction of herself and her 12 &quot;rainbow tribe&quot; children, she gratefully accepted Castro's invitation to perform in Cuba.  <br />In the 40 or so years since her early days in Paris, her voice had matured from something small and sometimes shrill, to an instrument of great expressive power and impeccable control.  She easily took to Latin American adaptations of the songs she had made popular in France, and readily internalized the Cuban tunes  &quot;Esto es Felicidad&quot; and &quot;Quando, quando&quot;.   Other than offering a most enjoyable Latin side of Josephine, this album is the only source I've found of some important material (i.e.: &quot;Dans mon Village&quot;, sung in French) and is a must-have for anyone wishing to appreciate Mme. Baker in her later and best artistic years."
1452,5,So I bought this album again after playing the original vinyl to death... I bought it first years ago... 30 now and this album still raises a smile... U just have to listen to Bedrock and Ramrod to start grinning at the superb writing style of this guy... then experimenting in sound with the next few tracks... Then we get The Only Good Christian... Has to be listened to to be believed... a super track...<BR> All in all this album is a must for all you people who like their music on a different vine... Just catch OKFM and you'll know what I mean...<BR> Five stars are well deserved with this one... after all where else can u find so many styles of music on one cd?
1453,4,"Man, these guys kick serious ASS!  The musical style is a mixture of heavy southern blues (COC, Sixty Watt Shaman, Stoner Kings), and good old fashioned HARD rock and roll.  There is a bit of a &quot;stoner&quot; rock vibe throughout, but to label the music as such would do Blind Dog a great disservice.  The rhythm section simply keeps things heavy and full, providing a great foundation for the stellar guitar work and solid, raspy, soulful vocals. The rhythms are up tempo and crisp, and the time signatures change to keep the flow and energy steady and interesting.  There is even a little acoustic work in there that is really cool.  I will purchase the follow on just as soon as I possibly can; these guys are a real treat!"
1454,5,"&quot;Try&quot; is a good song in its original version, but the acoustic version is even better! It's all guitar music until toward the end, when soft strings come in and make for a very climactic ending to a beautiful and honest song.<br />The acoustic version of &quot;I'm Like A Bird&quot; is also very gorgeous.<br />Then of course there's the video for &quot;Try,&quot; this single has it all! I reccomend it highly."
1455,4,"Always been a fan of hockey, and throughout the whole movie loved the music.  Kind of sent chills down your spine and goosebumps on your arms from how good it was, yet you would think they would have added Dream On by Aerosmith due to only having 7 songs.  4 out of 5 stars."
1456,5,"Someone turned me on to this CD, and it is a gem! I liked Gwin's old band, the Mother Station, but this is unbelievable. The songs are great, especially \\""Yesterday & Days Before\\"" and \\""I Can Feel It.\\"" And her guitar-playing rocks. And her cover of Bill Wither's \\""Ain't No Sunshine\\"" is no slouch either. Really there isn't a bad song here, and her voice is sexy. I haven't herd anything like her.<br />Do your self a favor and BUY IT!!!"
1457,5,"I saw the movie with my best friend and it is an awesome movie, So, I bought the CD. This CD really shows all the movie's hot spots."
1458,5,"I think everyone should listen to this CD because Will certainly cannot sing but has the guts to audition for American Idol and even get someone to put out a CD for him. Listen to it and get inspired. If he can make it, the American dream is alive and well. At least he is more genuine that Milli Vanilli...actually it will be fun to see him to &quot;Girl you know its true&quot; on his next CD."

1460,5,"After 'Post' no other BJork album was easy to listen, but 'Homogenic' started to delve into a much deeper and darker note that made her music outright tough to digest for a few people. A perfect example of this is the loaded \\""Pluto\\"". However, while being dark in some tracks, others such as \\""Unravel\\"" and \\""All Neon Like\\"" are, hands down, among the best songs (by BJork or anyone else) you will hear, and \\""All is Full of Love\\"", with its minimalist approach sets the stage for things to follow.<br />Overall, if you pay close attention, the album is a perfect continuation of 'Post' and a tribute to good music and great taste. So, where were you in 1997? I was unravelling, while listening to 'Homogenic'."
1461,5,"This is a future classic! In my opinion Alicia Keys is a rare, rare talent. It's admirable that someone this young can make music, which is this mature. These songs have got it all - surface AND substance. Each and every song is great in its own right, but if I had to choose a couple of favorites, they would be: \\""You Don't Know My Name\\"", \\""If I Ain't Got You\\"", \\""So Simple\\"" and \\""When You Really Love Someone\\"".  Even the interlude \\""Feeling U, Feeling Me\\"" sounds fantastic. Alicia Keys obviously draws on classic influences such as Stevie Wonder, Bobby Womack and Marvin Gaye."
1462,4,"Ok, as much as I love Social D, Sick boy made me exactly that.  Sick.  I've always been a Social D fan, so dont think I'm doing this cuz I dont appreciate them.  if you want to hear the original (and in my opinion, the much much better) version of this song, get the MxPx album &quot;Let it Happen.&quot;  Social D just somehow made that song boring.  Otherwise, I love them.  Go out and buy it."
1463,5,"I live in on the outskirts of the desert Southwest, in Monument, Colorado.  I have made numerous excursions-pilgrimages to the unique, blasted, spiritually-drenched landscape of Southern Utah/North-Central New Mexico depicted in this entirely remarkable disc.  And I have never come away with anything other then entire awe.  And I can say without equivocation that the music of Peter Garland captures the geographic splendor of this magnificent desolation as nothing else can.<br />Minimalism, the MO of this disc, represents an entirely apposite approach to depicting the desperate glories of this stark, startling landscape.  Endless azure sky; arid, mesquite-sage wilderness, dotted by buttes and mesas; no settlements for hundreds of kilometers: a wilderness, but one suffused with magic.  Land of enchantment, indeed.  How to capture its subtle, wayward, unharnessable glories?  Live there.  Learn its secrets.  Drink deep of its subtle wisdom.  Meditate on its eldritch beauty.  And that's exactly what Peter Garland did.<br />Others, notably Georgia O'Keeffe and Ansel Adams, have sought to capture its magic in paint on canvas and black and white photography.  Indeed, entire communities (Santa Fe and Taos) have sprung up as graphic art-testimonies to its arcane, mysterious hold on the human spirit.<br />Here, Peter Garland, a transplanted Easterner, lured by the indomitable magic of this landscape, has found, serendipitously, the perfect aural vehicle for its monumental splendors:  The prodigious gifts of Aki Takahashi and the Abel-Steinberg-Winant Trio.  Takahashi, a pianist of magnificent and exceptional gifts, imbues the spacious compositions of Garland with a yearning, Sehnsuct-filled desperation/home-longing never before encountered in music.  Space and sonority constitute her tools.  Peculiar affinity, her method.  These combine with Garland's visionary compositions to produce music never before heard, music of the highest accomplishment, music of ravishing beauty, music of uncompromising starkness and skeletal austerity.  But of soul-devastating splendor.<br />Think Tony Hillerman, William Least Heat Moon, Dances with Wolves, Geronimo, Dee Brown, Edward Abbey, purged of their anger, put to music, and you get a poor picture of the glorious enchantment offered up here.  <br />One of my all-time favorite discs."
1464,5,"Saw Michael Buble on Ellen Degeneres today, bought the CD and it's soooooooooooooooooooo good! I also pre-ordered the DVD - it will be sooooooooooooo good to see him again.<BR>He has a cool voice (AND HE'S GORGEOUS TOO!!!!!)<BR>I think it was him singing in the movie Down With Love too."
1465,1,"You know what really makes me mad? When I find someone who is a Godsmack fan and they have no idea who Alice in Chains even is. This CD is terrible. I never thought I could find more things they ripped off AIC than their band name but I did. The music is so trying to be like AIC's music but they suck really bad at trying. Why can't they give up and just be themselves? Seriously, they're not even creative enough to think of their own band name or anything! And how dare anyone compare this to Metallica. Metallica inspires people, this crap is just for people who have never seen the world beyond MTV. I don't know what to say that has not already been said. The least they can do is just be a cover band of Alice in Chains and not try to actually BE Alice in Chains. Alice in Chains is perfect and priceless, this crap is not worth a cent."
1466,5,"In '88 UFO had a lot to prove. Their last album, as great as it<br /> was, was their least successful in many years, and the rock<br /> landscape was far less hospitable to the band than ever before.<br /> So Mogg, Simpson, Gray and Atomic Tommy shrugged and got down<br /> to business with this mini-album. This cd is a scorcher. UFO<br /> hadn't rocked this hard in years, and the performances are<br /> every bit as amazing as anything the band would ever do.<br /> Sadly, &quot;Ain't Misbehavin&quot; was even less popular than<br /> &quot;Misdemeanor&quot;, selling to the hardcore fans and not even being<br /> noticed by anyone else. It proved to be the final release<br /> from this lineup, as when the next UFO slab finally<br /> appeared four years later Mogg had again reorganised the band.<br /> UFO never put out substandard work, and &quot;Ain't Misbehavin&quot; can<br /> proudly stand alongside the rest of their amazing catalog."
1467,5,"Far and away Entombed's best Death-N-Roll album.  It may even be a better overall effort than &quot;Left Hand Path&quot; (no kidding).  More thrashing than &quot;Wolverine Blues&quot; album, at any rate! Great song-writing! Very consistent.  It just keeps raging on an on like rolling thunder, with each track standing out pretty well. Some killer bass-playing (of course).  Such a strong vocal presence, and beautiful guitar solos, and swinging drumming.  Reminds me of Motorhead's &quot;Sacrifice&quot; album.  <BR>The way these guys keep belting out rage-rock album to album after so many years leads us to the conclusion, these guys are still really pissed off! <BR>The best track on Uprising is their cover of Deadhorse's &quot;Scottish Hell.&quot;  Deadhorse were a local Houston, TX band.  The odd-ball lyrics are a Houston thing. <BR>I've got to give this 5 stars, though only because as an album, it dominates this genre. It makes bands like Hatebreed, Pro-pain, Cro-bar, Slipknot, Static X, Korn, and Mudvayne look pretty weak."
1468,5,"I discovered Cooper and his former band with this record when I was 19 years old, almost 5 years ago. 1972 pure sound of a young band full of humor and talent. What else could be said about School's Out, exept that it settled a huge basis of rock'n roll numerous bands have kept using since... How do you feel when you hear the first 20 seconds of School's Out ? You feel like you wanna be at school with your buddies, just for the pleasure of escaping thru a window and enjoying the forthcoming summer vacation...<BR> Now I want my kids to be raised with this background sound. I want my kids to know where the roots of rock'n roll are from. This album is a masterpiece, let's say it."
1469,5,"What a nice surprise! I will never regret that I bought this CD. &quot;Strive to be Happy&quot;, &quot;Upward Bound Experience&quot; and &quot;My Deep &amp; Magical Ambient&quot; with cool Spanish-guitar sounds are by far the best songs, &quot;Reality Check&quot; is extraordinary as well. I think this CD is perfect to be played having some martinis or even relaxing at home a Sunday morning. The singer has a beautiful voice. You should get this CD!"
1470,4,"THE FUNKY HEADHUNTER,the fourth album for this artist now simply called Hammer,sold far less than its two predecessors,PLEASE HAMMER DON'T HURT 'EM and TOO LEGIT TO QUIT. It also failed to spawn a handful of hits like its two predecessors did. Hammer had been dropped from the Capitol label after TOO LEGIT TO QUIT. This album, on a minor label called Giant,did spawn the hit IT'S ALL GOOD. OAKTOWN tells about the town where Stanley Kirk Burrell,aka Hammer,was raised. CAN'T FIGHT THE FEELING contains music from the late Marvin Gaye's LET'S GET IT ON. Hammer even changed his physical image. He now sports a goatee,a baseball cap backwards and baggy cargo pants,as seen in the cover photo. Hammer's career was at this time,1994,gradually faltering. So badly in fact,that he would eventually file for bankruptcy. His music was not selling much as did four years earlier when PLEASE HAMMER DON'T HURT 'EM was released."
1471,3,"Shine from 1984 is Frida's (Anni-Frid Lyngstad) second and last English solo-album after ABBA. Something's Going On (produced by Phil Collins) was a huge succes in 1982, so already in 1983 Frida was planning a follow-up. She recored several demo's of songs that she had written herself. Originally she wanted Phil Collins again to produce this album, but when it turned out he didn't have the time she went for Steve Lillywhite.<br />Shine was the last song recorded for this album. It became the first single, but was a commercial disappointment despite reaching the Swedish Top 10 and the Dutch Top 30.<BR>One Little Lie is perhaps the best song on the album. It has a great chorus and great lyrics as a whole. It was never released as a single. This is one of the few songs from Shine that would have fitted greatly on her previous album.<BR>The Face is probably the worst song from Shine. A boring melody and stupid lyrics.<BR>Twist In The Dark was released in some countries as a single. In my personal opinion this song isn't worth much, most certainly not a single release.<BR>Slowly is one of the best songs on this album. Written by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus from ABBA. The song has got great lyrics by Bjorn and Slowly would have fitted greatly on ABBA's &quot;Opus 10&quot;, if that album ever got recorded.<BR>Heart Of The Country reminds me of Scotland. It became a single in some countries I believe.<BR>Come To Me (I Am Woman) became the second official single. It's a nice ballad, but too long.<br />Chemistry Tonight is one of the lesser songs recorded for this album. It really doesn't go anywhere.<BR>Don't Do It was written by Frida herself. The synthesizer riff at the end reminds me very much of ABBA. With this track Frida proves that she could write her own songs quite well.<BR>Comfort Me is a great mysterious song. The meldoy and the vocals sound haunting, almost a bit like ABBA's Like An Angel Passing Through My Room. A nice closing song for this album.<br />Asa whole this album has some great songs on it, but there are also a couple of very weak songs on it. Quite a mixed bag. Frida was disappointed by it's commercial failure and this became her last album until 1996 when she recorded a Swedish solo album, Djupa Andetag, that reached the top of the Swedish charts. It's a shame Frida has never tried to record a new English solo-album, at least so far she hasn't. Her wonderful voice is missed on the popscene..."
1472,5,"This is their greatest work ever, and make no mistake about it.<BR>Some real great songs on this one:Sick sad little world being their best ever!<BR>NEVER DOWNLOAD MUSIC!<BR>BUY!BUY!BUY!BUY!BUY!BUY!"
1473,5,"I think this album really showcases all the different ways that Kelly can carry a song.  Kelly is an incredible talent and her voice shines and shines.  Frankly I am surprised how some people can give this album a bad review based on the perception of how she acted at the World Idol Competition.  That competition was beneath her, not that I think Kelly acted any way except professionally when there.  Disregarding any false perceptions of how Kelly acted at a talent competition showcasing very little 'talent', this album is great and I am anticipating her next album."
1474,5,"How do you write a review for the greatest album of all time? Well, I'll try. <BR>Recorded after &quot;Let It Be&quot;, they all knew this would likely be their last effort before everyone went on to solo careers. John had made his intentions clear to the others that he was going to leave, and despite all this, The Bealtes were able to come together (no pun intended) and create a masterpiece. The first hlaf of the album is mostly masterful singles - especially &quot;Come Together,&quot; &quot;Something,&quot; and &quot;Here Comes The Sun.&quot; The second half of the album is arguably better than the first, with two main medleys of songs.<BR>Rounding out this whole album and The Beatles' entire career as a group is fittingly &quot;The End.&quot; This is an essential album for everyone to have in their record collection.<br />If you arent' yet a Beatles fan, this is the album to get. The Beatles at their best and a final showing of unity after inner turmoil."
1475,2,Please do me a favor that when you see this cd on a store shelf you do not bye it. Okay I am going to drop the bomb now. I have been a Manny Manuel fan since his very first cd.  I do not own his cds I only own EN VIVO which was a cancert he did in 2000 in P.R. but my mom has his other cds. Since my mom and I are both Manny Manuel fans I was going to get it for my self the year befor last but I landed up getting it for my mom. You all would say thats sweet that I was not thinking just about myself. But I will say that I am glad I did not bye this piece of junk for myself. Manny Manuel only has 3 nice songs on this cd. Put out in 2 versions per song. The rest are just plain bad. The first 3 songs are the good ones and then 10'11'12' are the same songs in merengue. Its a shame for people who are Manny Manuel fans like my mom and me. If a friend has the cd don't even borrow it from him or her!!!!! Or for That matter don't borrow it from anybody. Manny Manuel has a new cd called Serenata which is all slow classic romantic music. I got it for my mom last year and its much better. I like all kinds of music in spanish and even in english. If you like that kind of stuff then get his new cd. But if you don't then wait about 2 or 3 years and he should have another new cd on the self like his past cds. And I hope that one will be alot better then his cd before Serenata. I rest my case. Thank You. I will give the cd 2 stars.
1476,1,"This is just plain bad. THis pop- punk is just getting out of hand. This stuff is pathetic. The leader singer can't sing and the rest of the guys just stand there and pretend like they are doing something. When I heard the song &quot;Swing,Swing&quot; on the radio, I promised myself that I would never listen to the radio again. It is horrible and the worst part about it was the lryics! So please for the sake of the music world ever coming back to what it use to buy, do not buy this cd!"
1477,5,"I cant believe how good this cd is. I was thinking i wouldn't like this cd, but boy was i surprised! Tis cd has to be my favorite out of all the cd's i own which is actually alot.My favorite songs are I'd do anything, I'm just a kid, addicted,my alien, the worst day ever and last but not least my overall favorite Perfect.This cd will not disappoint you. If you're looking for a good cd for a road trip this is it.Buy it."

The simple equipment, a wire running over a pulley and stretched by suspended weights on the end,  probably measured extension against attached weight or some such, but for me the sound vibrations of the plucked wire, the overtones and harmonics, stirred something inside me which I have never forgotten.<br />Many years later I felt the same excitement and more when I first heard the rudra veena.  The way such an instrument - in essence fashioned from simple hollow bamboo, pumpkin gourd and wire - could move the body and the soul was nothing less than heaven-inspired.   Just listen to those incredibly low notes and feel the vibrations pass through you.  Add to the wonderful deep sound of the instrument a musical form which addresses human striving for contact with the divine and you have a heady mix.<br />Dhrupad is an ancient and venerable musical form, and apart from the human voice the rudra veena is the only instrument which has credibility in its performance.  Sadly it is a dying art form, as is mastery of the instrument, which is why recorded performances such as this Nimbus recording of Zia Mohiuddin Dagar are such treasures.<br />Accompanied only by drone tanpuras, the master of the rudra veena plays alap jor and jhala in Raga Yaman.  For many sitar players this is the first raga they learn.  It is tuneful and its main movement easily assimilated.  But in this exposition, for 70 minutes we are treated to a masterly investigation into the nuances of each note of the raga, and the relationships between them.  The full beauty and complexity of the raga emerge and eventually we are treated to a pulsing and exciting affirmation of what we have learnt and enjoyed.  After the rudra veena ceases, for another half a minute we are left alone with the tanpura to allow our thoughts to return from the celestial to the real world. Wonderful sounds, wonderful music."
1480,2,"I have seen Michael in concert twice and have almost all of his other CDs but I have to say I was truly disappointed with this one.  I turned it on in the car in aniticpation of listening to some sweet sounds as I drove.  But by the third song I had enough.  I found myself skipping through track after track trying to find a song I liked but I couldn't find one.  The tempo of the songs is dreadfully slow. Painful even.  If the songs had been any slower, I would have fallen asleep at the wheel.  Quite simply, the songs are uninspiring and bore me.    I can only surmise that the blame has to be put on the horrid song selections.  I just don't think they are suited to his music style.  It is just not quite what I am used to from Michael.  I love him when he sings Gershwin but I am less than thrilled with this effort. This is one Feinstein CD that will probably never get played again. I had to rush home and put in an old Feinstein Gershwin CD just to get the tunes of this CD out of my head.  Sorry Michael, I still love you though.  Here's hoping for your next CD."
1481,5,"It has been a about a year since I've listened to this, but putting it on now leaves me confident that I'll never leave these grooves on the shelf that long again. Maybe it is my 'fresh ears' coming back to it anew, but I never realized quite the extent of the magic achieved on this disc; I knew it was good then, but...!<br />On this album - there best to date even though they've 'dropped' several since - covers all the bases: funk, punk, jazz, hip-hop, even a spot of trickling ambience. For those who've not heard MMW before, it is hard to describe: picture the slammin'est hip-hop bass/drum combo you've ever heard paired with a keyboard player playing in three different keys which normally might be unnatractive but somehow it sounds so good that you just don't care! Yup, that's it...with just a tad more attitude than what you've envisioned. <br />The big wiinners on the disk are &quot;Is there anyboddy here that love my jesus&quot;, &quot;Dracula&quot;, &quot;Strance of the spirit red gator&quot;, and &quot;Night Marchers. The grooves are killer, the improv is intense, the three musicians have never sounded better, and the vibe is completely tight. No complaints. <br />Enjoy!"
1482,5,"He was hiding a lot of skills behind those drums all those gigs with Ani!<BR>The voice especially is unique, beautiful and inspired."
1483,5,"This CD should have been titled \\""The Gospel According to Beth Hart\\"". What a powerhouse of soul and inspiration mixed with desire and passion!!! Beth takes you to the most inner depths of your soul that others artists wish they could do with their music. Janis would be proud.<br />Preach on Beth!!!!!!"
1484,5,"I got this album from the band members themselves.I think it is  great new school punk with a touch of old schoolness in it.My band all my dead children played with this band at jim dandy's in prunedale(aka prunetuckey).The a-hole who promoted the show did a freakin' lousy job at promoting it.Well,I won't get into that any further,but,they played there heart's out for what little people that were there.I mean it,they have alot of heart.I'm glad to have played with them and hope to do so in the future.I'm into hardcore and that's what my band plays,but these guys have a great mix of punk.Also they have a song on tony hawks underground video game and a split cd with legendary punk skate band jfa.You should definetly check out there cd and absolutly see them live it's a blast!"
1485,1,"This CD is horrible - I wish I could return it to the store for a refund.  It's not Ruben at all - must be an imposter trying to sing/rap/?  It will come out of my car cd player, back into the box and onto my shelf to gather dust.  Ruben, get new &quot;people&quot; to help you next time and return to your American Idol roots.  Thanks!!"
1486,5,"As I am sitting here I am listening to DJ Icey's remix of &quot;Five Minutes of Funk&quot;  Memories.  I graduated from High School in '85 and Whodini was the shiznit, as was Run DMC.

1487,4,I really enjoy listening to the music as I cruise around town with the convertable top down...  If you like to listen to the Go-Go's during the summer - You'll like this CD....
1488,4,"My dad really likes this album. He likes almost all of Bob Dylan's albums. He says Bob Dylan is \\""groovy, baby.\\"" My dad actually talks like that. He's an old hippie who smoked dope and sniffed glue to all the 60s rock classics. I smoke dope and sniff glue too, and spend the money I get from welfare on dope, glue, and Bob Dylan albums."
1489,5,"I would say that this is one of the best cd's out there on the market. I, personally, know every word yo every song on 'hybrid theory', 'meteora', and 'reanimation'.They're the best!!!"
1490,4,"Well, her first four albums with Stock-Aitken-Waterman represented one phase of her career.  With her self-titled album, Kylie Minogue found herself in a transition period that included this and her next album, Impossible Princess.  It's not at all bad, showing her trying new sounds and pop other than the bubblegum she felt had lost its flavour and had thus spat out, and some of Kylie's sensitive and nurturing side comes out as well.<br />The mid-paced \\""Confide In Me\\"", the first single, sports a mournful violin, later strings, which then gains a backbeat of an industrial-type drum machine. As a prelude to the title, she sings, \\""We all get hurt by love, and we all have a cross to bear, and in the name of understanding now, a problem should be shared.\\""<br />\\""Surrender\\"" and \\""If I Was Your Lover\\"" have the similar sound but without the strings.  The latter incorporates a more funky soul sound and backup singers.  Given the rest of the songs, these are filler.<br />Stylistically, the near-7 minute happy \\""Where Is The Feeling\\"" is the closest to the disco Kylie cut her teeth on, but the fresh style of Brothers In Rhythm's production, the bass rhythms, and some of the keyboards puts it above the S-A-W's bag of tricks.  \\""Everytime you want me too, I can make you happy\\"" she avers.<br />The soulful \\""Put Yourself In My Place\\"" is another great ballad sporting airy keyboards and thumping drums, and asks for some kind of empathy \\""before saying you won't be mine.\\""  Another standout cut.<br />Another standout cut, the contemplative, melancholy and dominant strings ballad \\""Dangerous Game,\\"" and the name of the game is love, of course.  Only Mariah Carey and Kylie Minogue can make the lonely waiting game so poignant, as well as falling under \\""the power to make or break my day.\\""  The emotion in her voice has improved since \\""If You Were With me Now\\"":  \\""I'm so alone/I feel so lonely/here on my own/I've lost my way\\"" she sings in the chorus.<br />The lush \\""Automatic Love\\"" is proof enough that drum machine ballads were done way before Dido hit big with \\""Here With Me.\\""<br />\\""Where Has The Love Gone\\"" asks Kylie in a near eight-minute dance opus with a steady drum machine and piano-synths.  Her voice nears Madonna's and as for its similarity to \\""Deeper And Deeper\\"" by the latter, well, Kylie scores head over heels by having better instrumentation, the soulful backing vocals, and to keep the energy going with that piano.<br />\\""Falling\\"" was written by Tennant/Lowe of the Pet Shop Boys and it's another filler track, bad considering the talent involved in the songwriting.<br />Kylie always was a present-oriented gal and that's proved here in the affirmative thumping disco of \\""Time Will Pass You By,\\"" which seems a template of the material she would in her second disco era, starting with Light Years.  She offers people to take her hand, showing them how to live, to give themselves a better chance.  A great track to end the album.  Despite the obvious filler, Kylie Minogue is a brave step in moving away from the S-A-W playroom.t drum machine ballads were done way before Dido hit big with \\""Here With Me.\\""<br />\\""Where Has The Love Gone\\"" asks Kylie in a near eight-minute dance opus with a steady drum machine and piano-synths.

1491,5,"Blues Traveler is one of the most talented bands today, and they are a nice change from the monotous pop/rock cluttering up the radio these days.  The thing that stands out most about this album is obviously the harmonica solos and unigue vocals of headman John Popper.  Bassist Bobby Sheehan adds a lot to the songs with his fast, moving bass parts, and the drums and guitar blend together very nicely to form a unique and pleasant sound.  There is not a single bad track on this CD, and it never gets old.  The Moutains Win Again is one of the best songs I have ever heard, and the harder Rock/Blues sound of Crash Burn and Stand display their obvious musical skill.  This album is worth every cent, and is absolutely essential to any substantial music collection."
1492,5,"A. Keys is an innovative, mature, and sophisticated young talent with sooo much promise for longevity.  The Diary is pure artistry, lyrically rich, and something that we should be proud will someday represent our era in music.<br /><br />The Diary of Alicia Keys is an extenstion of its predecessor, the incomparable \\""Songs in A Minor\\"", and like it, there is not one single song that you'll need to skip past.  At the same time it's refreshing to see where she's grown.  She knows that she doesn't have to shout it, no gratuitous/showy vocal runs are necessary, the girl just saaangs the song, you know?  I saw her peform at the Fox in Detroit and it amazed me all over again, how fantastic of a musician and vocalist she is.  All I can say, no... all I can PROMISE is that this CD is another classic, another must have.  Don't sleep."
1493,4,You might have seen my review about John Mayers Hevier Things and how I did not like it.  Well I agree with previous reviewers that Dave Matthews fans will like this CD.  A little hazy but still a good CD.  Takes similar aspects to Live At Red Rocks from DMB.  I would like to hear some more guitar solo parts though on some of his newer CD's.
1494,4,"Probably the best thing to come out of the nations capitol since &quot;Bad Brains&quot;, &quot;Fugazi&quot; continues to fight the good fight. &quot;13 Songs&quot; is the combination of their first two EPs, and includes such classics as &quot;Waiting Room&quot;, &quot;Margin Walker&quot;, and &quot;Bad Mouth&quot;. What makes them a great punk band, is that besides the look and the sound, they have something important to say, which is evident in songs such as &quot;Suggestion&quot; and &quot;Burning Too&quot;. The only thing that bums me out when I listen to this, is that I know teens today are unaware of &quot;Black Flag&quot; and &quot;Minor Threat&quot;, and they are under the impression that bands such as &quot;Good Charlotte&quot; and &quot;Simple Plan&quot; are punk."
1495,5,"If anybody ever looks blank when you mention Matt's name, just point out that he immortalized the Theme Song for From Russia With Love. If they don't recognize the man's brilliance immediately as in &quot;Oh him... amazing voice&quot; they are either too young or have no musical taste whatsoever.<br />This is a classic selection of Matt's work and absolutely ridiculous value at the price Amazon.com are offering. Pick any song at random and you will realize that this man was literally second to nobody in this world. Like Jack Jones (another of my fave singers) Matt was his own man and never walked in anybody's shadow.<br />Who knows, maybe if he'd been born on our side of the Atlantic, he could have soared even higher, but as other fans have said, it is actually very gratifying to know that we always knew him for the genius that he truly was."
1496,5,"First of all - why box Cyndi into any type of music?  <br />Secondly - I dislike SONY as much as most of Cyn fans do!<br />Now the record!  The best songs come from the reviews that were really thought out, and here they are:<br />1) Walk on by - it is flat out eerie<BR>2) Don't Le me be Misunderstood<BR>3) Unchained Melody - a song most people cannot stand has finally been done correctly!<BR>4) At Last - I mean At Last - the sales will be good - my email is andyinsuffolk631@aol.com - if she does not debut Thursday (On Billboard) in the Top 25 - feel free to email me either way.<BR>5) You've Really Got A Hold On Me<BR>6) Hymn to Love<br />Listen - the 3 fun songs done on this album are needed!  They are very good.  Lauper's finesse and co-arrangements - and her downright incredible interpretations are remarkable.  I have all the 90s CDs and Shine.  But who says she is limited to SOA or HFOS?  I am lucky  - I live in NY - I am 35 and have seen Cyn 8 times live - she is popular in this state - I live on Long Island.<br />Out of 66 reviews - one mentioned the Grammy Nomination.  I had the same thought when I heard the record.  I have turned non-Lauper fans into fans.<br />This record is dark like most of Lauper's work. The 80s are over - the 90s sucked - cos she released 2 excellent albums.  Time to go with the flow people.<br />At Last - the album - is underproduced (great move) - perfect vocals - simplistic arrangements - and a new spin on songs that quite frankly were mediocre.  Cyndi brings them to justice - jeez - all songwriters (dead or alive) are loving this album.  This CD really works!  Buy it peeps!  If you want shallow - buy Madonna or Britney Spears - if you want class - buy Cyndi.  <br />Finally - \\""At Last.\\"" Cyndi will return to the charts - this is no Babs BS - ask her to play an instrument or write a song?  I just laugh!  Barbara has an incredible instrument in her voice - Cyn can just write music and play many instruments - which to me gives her the advantage!!!  GO CYNDI!!!!!<br />2005 Cyndi qualifies for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame!  Will it be Madonna or Cyndi who gets in first - Thank god there are standards to enter the R&R Hall of Fame!<br />Buy this CD - it is absolutely beautiful - there will be a Grammy nomination for album of the year - Rod Stewart just does not have the voice or insight Cyndi has - Bette is not in the running!<br />Peace to all - even if we disagree."
1497,5,"&quot;Ashanti's Christmas&quot; is a Christmas classic that I know I'll be playing all this season. Ashanti brings us fun Christmas songs from classics to her own. Some of the best tracks include &quot;Hey Santa&quot;, &quot;Christmas Time&quot;, &quot;A Christmas Song&quot;, &quot;This Christmas&quot;, and &quot;Slient Night&quot;."
1498,5,"Okay...Yes, this is one of the most challenging albums that I have ever heard. It is by turns discordant, insulting, loud and irritating. It is all these things and more, you see, that make this album great.<BR>I have been that guy who has lent it to a friend and had it thrown back in my face, accompanied by all the usual spiteful remarks associated with the denouncement of such a work. It's interesting that nearly all nay-sayers of this album refer to things like the Turner prize. I love the Turner prize and almost anything considered 'modern' art. I also love Hendrix, Zappa, Pink Floyd, Miles Davis, Thelonius Monk, Beethoven and Bartok. These penchants are not mutually exclusive. The sickening thing about most modern-day music 'lovers' is their tendancy to trash anything that is truly different. A famous film critic once said, &quot;There are people who love movies, and there are people who love the movies THEY love.&quot;<BR>When it comes down to it, there really isn't that much stuff around that is hard to listen to. Now, I don't just mean challenging, and I don't mean hard to listen to like a constant ear-splitting tone; not physically difficult. I mean difficult like a literary tome or sprawling canvas from back-in-the-day. Something that wasn't written for 'you' per say. Difficult like 'Finnegan's Wake' or 'Guernica'.<BR>I've often said that when people start to think of Pink Floyd as truly experimental or ground breaking, then the creative world is in real trouble. Pink Floyd (and others; I don't mean to dis 'Floyd) are not difficult, they are just an aquired taste. The typical formula goes something like: &quot;People who like Zappa will like 'Floyd&quot; or &quot;People who like Tchaikovsky will like Prokofiev&quot;-it's simple, right? Sure, I agree, but don't you get bored of formulas? I do. So here's the really wierd part: There is a lot of difficult stuff that I don't like, but I still consider it some of man's best work. It's a tough space to occupy, but it's the only way I feel I can truly widen my horizons.<BR>As an example, I've probably only listened to this album twice in the past year. When I first got it, I yearned to know it, so I sat down, got stoned, and listened to it again and again and again...But now that I feel I know it as well as I ever will, that's just not necessary; basically, if Trout Mask Replica were a picture, then I wouldn't hang it in my living room, but I wouldn't hang &quot;The Scream&quot; there either. A lack of typical as-we-know-it beauty does not make a given work redundant OR unimportant.<BR>I guess what I really want to say is (if what I'm thinking CAN be properly expressed in words), just because you wouldn't put it on to relax to of an evening, doesn't mean to say it's no good.<BR>Be a person who loves music for goodness' sake; VOTE BEEFHEART!!"
1499,5,"Brendel is an incredible pianist, and a scholar of music as much as a virtuouso.  This is a beautifully played and beautifully CHOSEN collection of music.  In an interview included in the notes, Brendel points out that many of Bach's works seem to be written for instruments of the future: some pieces like the Chromatic Fantasy seem to be failures as written for the harpsichord but are wonderful played on the piano.<br />I don't miss whatever authenticity might be lost, then, by playing these on the piano.  I loved how simple it was to hear the different strands of melody that wind their way around each other in the first movement of the Italian Concerto, and to hear how clearly Brendel articulated the rushing melody of the Prelude in A Minor.  He's amazing: I started with his recordings of Schubert but am starting to prefer his versions of Beethoven and Bach as well.<br />Even his choices of what to play are revelatory.  The Busoni arrangement of Ich 'ruf zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ is astounding.  It was only after I ran out, got a book of the Busoni arrangements and tried to play the prelude myself that I realized how hard it was to play this (technically) fairly simple piece as beautifully and delicately as Brendel plays it.  <br />Anyone who thinks that Bach is a dry, academic composer - or who wrote music that is coldly beautiful but not heartfelt - needs to hear these three minutes of music to know how much love went into everything he wrote."
1500,5,This is a wonderful CD. The  entire performance is absolutely perfect. Its the first Christmas CD we listen to every year and now my children start asking to hear it around Thanksgiving. I can't count the number of people I've given this to as a gift. We're are on our second copy!
1501,5,"I bought Fallen after seeing Evanescence in concert in February at the famous Metro in Chicago.  This was weeks before the C.D. even dropped.  The tickets cost a mere $8.  That was the best money I've ever spent. The concert was amazing and I knew within the first notes of the first song that I would be buying Fallen as soon as it hit the shelves, also money well spent.<br />     Maybe it's the tortured soul within me but this sound and these lyrics were something I could relate to.  They were what I have wanted to belt out many times had I had the ability.  And Amy has a certain distinct quality to her that I found very inspiring.  There is so much emotion behind every word she sings.  It's truly amazing."
1502,5,"Frankly, I am puzzled by the editorial review.  We obviously were not listening to the same music.  Though maybe it is simply the reviewer's lack of depth or jaundiced view towards life in general...<br />Susan Werner's melodies and lyrics touch my soul (and my funny bone...)in places most music can't even reach.  And - what on EARTH is wrong with thinking life is good even when there are times when it really sucks???  The reviewer must not be much fun to play with...<br />Susan is top-notch!  Her voice invades your being and lifts your heart - makes you think and often makes you laugh.  Her incredible voice and powerful lyrics blend into an experience you will not soon forget.  From the first song to the last you will be entranced by the spell she weaves.  Don't miss this one.  You will never be the same.  Check out her tour schedule and if you are lucky you can see her in person if she's in your area.<br />Don't worry, Susan!  Thre are plenty of us who get it."
1503,5,"Boo to me. I am a Wino latecomer, having caught on after the release of Spirit Caravan's &quot;Elusive Truth&quot; album. After a year of ingesting Spirit Caravan, I began to discover how truly innovative they were compared to your average stoner rock fare. There was purpose behind these songs and while they rocked, one could assess that consideration was taken when it came to issues of songwriting, tonality and overall delivery.<br />I never got to see Spirit Caravan live and after SC ended, rumors were abound that Wino was planning on disappearing from music altogether. Much to the rumor mill's contradiction, it was announced shortly thereafter that Wino had formed a new outfit of doom called The Hidden Hand so naturally, an eyebrow on my face was raised with curiousity and anticipation. As the months raced towards the album's release date, all kinds of comparisons were being made to Wino's previous outfits, as well as Motorhead, Black Flag and even progressive rock.<br />i have listened to this album several times since acquiring it and to be honest, the comparisons made are all pretty spot on. All of those traits lie within but there's so much more inside beyond those mere measurings. Inside, you will find 40 + years of rock music influence all tightly coiled into one outstanding album. Naturally; for the stoner rock enthusiast, Wino stands out as the most recognizable figure but even he would point out that this inspiring album was more the sum of it's parts rather than a one man job.<br />The most recognizable trait of The Hidden Hand's &quot;Divine Propaganda&quot; is the overall illuminati conspiracy subject matter but rather than go from the drunk punk &quot;F**k the system&quot; podium, The Hidden Hand paints a bleak portrait of a society ruled by an unseen force through a combination of aggressive and heavy music and uncompromising and questioning dialect. However, the lyrics don't merely command you to question authority but rather to investigate and accept the possibility that it's not &quot;this administration&quot; or &quot;that administration's&quot; fault, but rather that we have been set up all along and this course of action we have become witness to has been in the making for thousands of years with ultimate intent to drag us into a one world government and more specifically, a totalitarian police state.<br />Naturally then, the music is anything but your average upbeat sound with an optimistic worldview. Much like the drudging content contained therein, the music is rolled out in an equally focused and bleak manner. It is a melding of Sabbath-style chord progressions played with the skill of guitar master like Jimi Hendrix or Pepper Keenan and the aggression and angst of Black Flag.<br />This could get the nod for best heavy rock record of 2003. Everything is so well done and articulate and the overall message is clear and precise without being preachy or forceful. You owe it to yourself to investigate this album.ccept the possibility that it's not &quot;this administration&quot; or &quot;that administration's&quot; fault, but rather that we have been set up all along and this course of action we have become witness to has been in the making for thousands of years with ultimate intent to drag us into a one world government and more specifically, a totalitarian police state. <br />Naturally then, the music is anything but your average upbeat sound with an optimistic worldview.

1504,5,"Kill Hannah is the best band from the Thriving Chicago rock scene. A city that has produced bands such as the Smashing Pumpkins and Local H now has a new band to be pround of. From the opening track of &quot;They can't save us now&quot; this band keeps the listener wanting more. The single &quot;Kennedy&quot; is just a beutiful piece of song writting about glamour and the hollowness of being famous. Additionally songs such as &quot;Unwanted&quot; and &quot;Boys and Girls&quot; change the mood of the CD from The Cure type of influences and add some uptempo beats in the vein of Blink 182. Overall, a must have CD and a band to anticipate much from in the future."
1505,4,"hi there...i've read all the reviews and to my mind, there are only a couple of true met fans...those who have stuck with metallica since the beginning know this album is one of the best of them. Face facts people, they are not the same musicians from 15 years ago, they are a lot mature now and it shows here..a little of prog rock, old school heavy metal sound...just the perfect balance.Anyways, to those who jumped in the bandwagon since the &quot;black&quot; album, accept it, this cd is way much better, and the lack of solos prove that kirk and james are one, if not the best, duo guitar players in the field of heavy metal. Accept that the best parts of the songs were James amazing riffs...and here both of them play cool parts...just listen to sweet amber, St. anger, Frantic, The unnamed feeling...to thos e who don't want to accept it, go back to limp bizkit and korn...then come to the major leagues"
1506,1,"When I saw this CD I did feel a little rush of excitement, being a prog rock fan and a DJ remixer myself. Sadly it dadn't last long. This is a sad amateur attempt which could really have been good. It's too bloated and disjointed to be a dance album, and too odd to be of interest to the hard line fans. Three words I can use to describe it is boring, turgid and bloated. Unfortunatly it's just the son of one of the band who got some new kit for his birthday having a mess about. If anyone else had produced this drivel, it wouldn't have ever been released. Let Fat Boy Slim or Bent have a go, to show the little laddy how it's done. Tsk Tsk. Shame on you Yes."
1507,5,"Before I talk about this album, can I ask one thing?  Can we leave out politics, history, etc out of it?  Geez, so their title is a clever take on the 2000 election.  Just focus on the music and not get wrapped up over trivial stuff and take your political rantings and diatribes to some political message board, but not here, okay?  No wonder why artists like Marilyn Manson sell so many albums because you have clueless individuals railing on them which in turn causes people to go out and buy the d*mn album to see what all the fuss is about!  It is called marketing, people, look into it...<br />Anyway, back to the actual review:  this is the 6th (7th counting the live album, &quot;I May Be Wrong&quot;) album by them that I have.  I love &quot;Kid A&quot; the best, but recognize the brilliance of &quot;The Bends&quot; and &quot;OK Computer&quot;.  I never liked &quot;Amnesiac&quot; that much, but &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; is a better album but just a level below the threesome of Bends, Computer, and Kid A.  It is like a combination of old albums that were put together, but it works well as there is more guitar on this album than the last 2, but still some elements of electronica.<br />My favorite tracks are &quot;Go to Sleep&quot;, &quot;A Punchup at a Wedding&quot;, &quot;2 + 2 = 5&quot;, and &quot;The Gloaming&quot;.  &quot;Go to Sleep&quot; might replace &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot; as my all-time favorite Radiohead song...it is that good!  All the tracks are solid but the ones I mentioned are the ones that stood out.  <br />Yet another solid album by the best band in music today.  If you enjoy Radiohead, I highly suggest looking at buying stuff by Sigur Ros, as they have been an influence on Thom and the boys and vice versa.  Also, for those that loved the electronica side of Radiohead, look into getting stuff by Aphex Twin aka Richard James, a modern musical genius.  He is not for everybody, but if you ever get into his stuff, you will be sucked inpermanently!"
1508,1,"From the promo sample I heard, I can safely say this one can be passed up. It was just boring. Her vocals combat with the beats, and the songs are repetitive and boring. A better bet would be a Madonna remix, somthing like the maxisingle Rain. This has &quot;waiting&quot;, that has a rap by Everlast. It was originally released in 1992 before Mariah released Fantasy with ODB. <br />Mariah is simply not an innovator and it shows in her music. She needs to work with some fresh producers and learn to tailor her voice with different genres of music."
1509,4,"This is considered a cornerstone of atonal free-form jazz. What that means is that there just is no diatonic framework for the song. &quot;Free&quot; is just another word for that. Call it &quot;accidental&quot; or &quot;absence of a key&quot;, in this strict sense it is neither really atonal nor free. Coleman never called his music &quot;Free Jazz&quot; either, except this album. <br />Given the fact, that his was recorded 1960, it's hard to call it revolutionary. Comparing the monotonous rhythm of this recording with the liberated drums of a Charles Mingus album from that time, it still is quite traditional for that matter. As an experiment it didn't fail, because you can tell it is just that, an experiment."
1510,5,"Of you like dis music you should get it, even if you don't like it.. YOU MUST GIT IT!"
1511,5,"Straight off - If you're appreciative of HipHop DJing with the underground feel &amp; finesse, then this CD is on point! If you like deep bass &amp; chunky old skool HipHop beats / breaks you can move your feet to, this one does it! If you like New Skool HipHop (snoop &amp; dre) harmoniously mixed with Old Skool cuts (RUN DMC &amp; Gangstarr) all laced together by head noddin', dance- friendly licks, Deadly Avenger's Fabriclive 04 session will have you satisfied with every penny you spent on it - BELIEVE.<br />This mix is in the same vein as DJ Shadow, James Lavelle, any Invisible Scratch Pickles comp, or any other DJ who puts out-the-ordinary tracks together for epic-style sessions. In fact the closest mix I'll compare this one to is Prodigy's Dirt Chamber Session Vol. 1. However it holds itself down the palate of flavors of plain good old butt-shakin' tunes that you know at sometime or another you've heard somewhere in the HipHop timeline.<br />I especially recommend this mix to anyone who is a true-headed Breakdancer. B-BOYS &amp; B-GIRLS....FLOOR-ROCK TO THIS MIX!"
1512,5,"Well ..... what are you waiting for?? <BR>Its Seal for God's sake, you can't lose!!!! Its brilliant!!! Great voice, killer sounds, kick arse music for the serious music lovers.<BR>This boy has come a long way and now he's home.<br />Enjoy!!!"

Arie, Remy Shand, Erykah Badu), and is a native of<BR>Philadelphia-Latif has all of the elements of becoming part of the Neo Soul Movement. As a new artist in the music industry there's no way to survive unless you prove yourself, and on his debut Love In The First Latif's music proves him victorious. Winner of the Teen Choice Award for Best Upcoming Artist, Latif has already achieved some success. On the smooth first single \\""I Don't Wanna Hurt You\\"" Latif talks about choosing between one committed relationship or many brief intimacies. He ultimately comes to the decision to let the one he loves go rather than have her suffer. Throughout the soulful adventure, Love In This First delivers real, personified music, main subjects being love and relationships. From the blissful times, like that in \\""Heavenly\\""; in contrary, there are downs like that in \\""Who's Loving Her Now?\\"" In the song \\""My Man's Girl\\"" Latif discusses the problems arising from falling for your friend's ex, also like that in \\""My Sister's Girlfriend\\"" Latif falls for his sister's friend, in result the difficulties overpass his feelings. Falling short on \\""Girl,\\"" Latif disappointingly sings in a faster pace, sounding like that of B2k, which sound is more of POP than Soul. But he rebounds with the suave self-titled track \\""Love In The First.\\"" In the inspirational \\""Rain Will Go Away,\\"" Latif informs that with the bad will follow the good, therefore to look forward because there is hope. In its entirety Love In The First is an album with complete satisfaction.<br />Hot Tracks: \\""I Don't Wanna Hurt You,\\"" \\""Without U,\\"" \\""Rain Will Go Away,\\"" \\""Heavenly\\"""
1515,5,"I bought this CD and enjoy every song.  The traditional songs are so energetic. I think the music is a combination of Scruggs, Bela Fleck style and old time banjo music.  <br />What's unique about the music on this CD is even though it some tuba, drums and even electric guitars are also added to the mixed which gave a great sound even though the sound is still bluegrass overall.  I know that drums, tubas and electric guitars don't belong in bluegrass music, but this CD is the exception rather than the rule."
1516,5,"TZN deserves 5 stars simply because he made the Italian music scene breathe some fresh air!!<br />He succeeded where others failed miserably - singing modern R&B \\""Made in Italy\\"". He wrote all his songs and, being only 23 years old, I think that's quite an achievement!<BR>I guess the reason behind his international success is the fact that, even though he's Italian, his music sounds like it could come from anywhere in the world. Of course, if you understand the lyrics, it's a great advantage as he's quite a modern day poet! <br />Btw... his new single is out now!!!<BR>It's called \\""Xverso\\"" (perverted). It's on top of all Italian charts at the moment. Maybe not as catchy as Xdono but still a very good song... and very much his style.<BR>Xverso is the first single of his next album which will be released worldwide on November 7 called \\""Centoundici\\"" (111)<BR>If u want more information about it, this website seemed quite helpful to me:<BR>[...]<br />PS: It seems that TZN is quite popular in my part of the world! : )"
1517,5,"If you like hardcore with lots of bass and happy lyrics, here is your cd. Dougal's mix is the best!! All the songs are happy/up-lifting. Hixxy's mix is really good and bouncey with lots of hard bass and mixed really good too. Sharkey......eh.....Dougal and Hixxy are awsome! Buy this cd for them!"
1518,5,"THE BEST OF ZZ TOP is a great summation of ZZ Top's early years, even with a few great songs missing. The original albums are essential, but if you just want an overview, get this one."
1519,2,"I bought this disk set after thoroughly LOVING the &quot;Paris Lounge&quot; sets, and thought this one would HAVE to be just as good. I was wrong. Sure, there are some good, &quot;essentials&quot; from Thievery Corporation and Thunderball, but most music listeners interested in this genre already have those tracks. If you don't, do yourself a favor and pick up some ESL compilations like &quot;Den of Thieves,&quot; or &quot;Modular Systems.&quot; They represent the best electronic lounge music available. <BR>As for &quot;New York Lounge,&quot; unlike its Parisian-predecessors, its not lounge music. Instead, its a compilation of well produced, but musically mediocre R&amp;B. Even the track by Miss Kittin (again.. not lounge, but at least cool) gets boring, with &quot;Bill-Cosby as a pimp&quot; style voice-over. <BR>I haven't heard any others in this series yet, (Berlin, etc...) but I KNOW (because I live there!) that New York has better than this to offer."
1520,5,"I have not listened to this cd in a very long time - I just did and it is still really good - I would love to get in contact with any of the singers in this group.  If they read this review and see my name, they should know who I am and I wish they would contact me.<br />Barbara from brooklyn now in NJ<BR>email me at bhall07@optonline.net"
1521,4,"I normally don't post reviews on CD's but just had to add my 2 cents on this one. I will start off with the bottom line: You will either like this or hate it. I personally like it a lot. I agree it is not for everyone and I don't think it was meant to be. I am a 36 y.o. diehard fan of Yes and have been since 1980. I love all their music and have been recently collecting all the fantastic Rhino remasters (which I highly recommend btw).Anyhow, I also have a very varied and eclectic taste in music including much of the current 'electronica'( Techno,Trance,Drum&amp;Bass,etc..)Perhaps it is because I also enjoy these styles of music is the reason I find this release by The Verge very interesting and enjoyable. While his renditions are in no way a substitute ( I don't think he intended them to be)for the original classics (he even recommends checking out the original versions in his CD liner notes)they are refreshing and even a bit exciting to hear the classics re-worked and re-configured into new 'songs'in a modern sound/style.I'm not even saying this disc is perfect and amazing but at least a worthy effort and fun listening ( and I think this CD is meant to be 'fun' whereas the real YES music is quite more 'serious. I think that's why we have such a difference in opinion with this). I can totally understand and respect why some would absolutely hate this stuff and call it horrible but I feel they simply don't have an 'ear' for this style of music (and I'm sure some wouldn't even call this 'music') and that's fine. It's not their 'cup of tea' as they say. I have been listening to this CD for about a week now and I find it thoroughly enjoyable. I would assume The Verge got the 'stamp of approval' for this project since he is after all the son of Mr Steve Howe (a virtuoso who takes his music seriously as we all know). I would also assume that Steve and probably the rest of Yes must find this CD at least interesting and worthy or else they would not allow it's release. Thisis just how I look at it.<BR>So, if you have an open mind , enjoy a lot of modern 'electronica' styles/sounds and don't mind hearing bits and pieces of YES classics sampled and re-worked into something new and very different then check this CD out. If this does not sound at all interesting then just stick with the original YES recordings. You can't go wrong with that...I think we'll all agree! YES!"
1522,4,"Unlike albums that came after it, Divine Intervention maintains the Slayer sound of their earlier discs. It is faster and thrashier and the sound is better than on Seasons in the Abyss but the songwriting is not as strong. Dittohead is the best song, but Killing Fields, Circle of Beliefs and 213 are good, too. I usually skip Sex.Murder.Art and Fictional Reality.<br />Bottom line - I you like 80s Slayer you will probably like this, too. I don't find myself listening to it as much as South of Heaven, Reign in Blood, Hell Awaits and Show No Mercy but I put it in and enjoy it when I feel like listening to something different. Needless to say it's far superior to recent trash like God Hates Us All."
1523,4,"As a record store employee, I hear many different complaints about many different albums.  My least favorite complaint is &quot;I liked their _____ album better.&quot; (whether it be first, last, or what have you).  I don't see what there is not to like on &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;.  It's pure Spiritualized.  Is it as good as &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen...&quot;, of &quot;Let It Come Down&quot;?  I don't think so.  But what does that matter?  I like &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; better than I like &quot;Animals&quot;, but that doesn't mean that I wouldn't recomend &quot;Animals&quot; to anyone.  &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; may not be as good as previous efforts, but there is enough good on the album to help it stand on its own.  Spiritualized was 3/3 before I bought &quot;Amazing Grace.&quot;  Based on that, I took a chance, and now the Spaceman is 4/4."
1524,5,I think this album may be the best I've ever owned.
1525,5,"Forty Licks is a compilation that should not only be in the collections of Stones fans, but of anyone who likes rock and roll.  Now, I will admit, when I was younger I was anything but a Rolling Stones fan.  But after their last two studio albums (Voodoo Lounge and Bridges To Babylon) I started to like them.  Then I saw them on the Bridges tour here in St. Louis (the show they recorded for the video/DVD) and was amazed at the show they put on.<br />This 2-disc compilation includes all of the songs played in the concert except one (Which isn't much of a loss.) and twenty-one more tracks that just rock.  The sound quality to me is fantastic and the selections that they included on this set were very good.  The four new tracks are all pretty good if not very good, and there are no tracks on this compilation that do not deserve to be on there.<br />I say that this is &quot;an almost essential collection&quot; only because I was rather disappointed that there was not more material from the last two albums.  But with a band that has been around forty years that is probably nit-picking.  (Although I would have loved to have &quot;She's So Cold&quot; on this set.)<br />Basically, I would highly recommend this compilation for anyone who generally likes the Rolling Stones but is not too excited about buying all of their albums like myself.  And I would strongly recommend this compilation for anyone who likes good old-fashioned rock and roll."
1526,2,"Im more of a classic AE fan. stigmata, Burning Bridges, etc. this album is just way to &quot;nu&quot; metal for me. It still has some classic AE moments (nice solo here, cool riff there) But if your a fan like me than dont even waste your time. It basically just picks up where Wages left off. A song will start off with a good hook and then it just looses ya. It seems like the Amott bros. dont even try anymore. In comparison to their other stuff, its a waste of money. but if your into this kinda music than by all means, knock your self out. whatever floats your boat I guess."
1527,4,"Anita Baker gets CAUGHT UP IN THE RAPTURE of jazz and soul. SWEET LOVE is the album's first hit,and later most of the other songs would appear on the Hit Parade. Anita's personal composition WATCH YOUR STEP,was not a hit,though. She covers MYSTERY which was a hit for THE MANHATTAN TRANSFER. Other hits from this album include NO ONE IN THE WORLD and SAME OL' LOVE. Almost every song on this album has been played on jazz stations all over America."
1528,4,"Being a fan of similar groups such as Joydrop and Evanescence, I have been looking for groups such as The Superjesus to listen to. This is a very good debut album, sometimes very raw and unhibited. I especially enjoyed Down Again, Saturation, I'm Stained and the final closing track which sounds oddly half-finished.<br />At times them music veers towards Grunge, but never quite getting there. It's a sort of melodic rock with a 'garagey' feel, almost like it was literally recorded in a garage. <br />Sarah Mcleod's vocal delivery is very good, occasionally rasping. Her vocals arent quite as diverse as say Tara Sloan or Amy from Evanescence but are still very good. Her vocals for example would fit nicely on albums by Love Spirals Downwards - another great group to check out.<br />On the strength of this album I bought the second album by The Superjesus which im looking forward to.<br />As mentioned earlier in the review if you like this kind of music there are many bands I could reccomend.<br />Obvious comparisons could be made with Nirvana, The Foo Fighters, The Cranberries, Veruca Salt, Mazzy Star, Hooverphonic, Joydrop and Evanescence.<br />If you havent heard of many of these bands there is a wealth of interesting music to be found there."
1529,5,"This is a brilliant debut recording from the best band of the 1980s. Also, it is about time that &quot;To The Shore&quot; is back where it belongs. Anyway, there is not a mediocre song on this CD; though I will admit that my favourite songs on this are not the 3 singles (&quot;Planet Earth&quot;, &quot;Careless Memories&quot;, &quot;Girls On Film&quot;) but songs like &quot;Night Boat&quot; and &quot;Sound Of Thunder&quot;. As a matter of fact, the latter track was a song Simon wrote when he was first accepted into Duran Duran. I just wish that they put videos on this CD like they did for the &quot;Rio&quot; CD."
1530,4,"Having heard all of smash mouth's other albums, I was sure that they could not produce another album to the same quality. How wrong i was. Almost all the songs on the album are extremely good and are a refreshing change of something to listen to. I could listen to the album again and again..."
1531,5,"It has been a long 17 year wait for this. The first album of new material since 1986's &quot;Electric Cafe&quot;. Totally worth it. In an age where many bands are constantly changing their sound to try and stay &quot;hip&quot; or whatever, Kraftwerk's signature sound remains crisp, precise, and absolutely brilliant. Like 1981's &quot;Computerwelt&quot;, the tracks on this album flow into one like a modern symphony. The moment I put this disc on, I was smiling. I have been a Kraftwerk fan for a long time, and they have yet to disappoint me. I cannot recommend this album or Kraftwerk as a whole enough to anybody. Even if Kraftwerk themselves are not your favorite, you HAVE to respect them for everything they have done for electronic music and more. Buy this album and see how one of the most influential bands of the last century have not missed a step in over 36 years as an entity."
1532,3,"Keep in mind that I have not quite earned the right to call myself a Phish Phan; I am merely a casual listener who cut his teeth on the Grateful Dead and am just beginning to dive into the sea of Live Phish.<br />I purchased A Live One a few weeks back. Actually I re-purchased it, I had owned it once before but never gave it a thorough listen to and wound up selling it a few years back.<br />That album was great, but it didn't quench my thirst for some new live music, so I picked up few sets from the Live Phish series. Volume 20 was one of those sets.<br />While there are certainly some high points on the disc, the disc also contains some parts that are just downright troublesome for me. The most notorious being the several minutes of whistles and calls for Lassie toward the end of David Bowie. They turned an otherwise intense improv into a bad joke. I could barely finish out the song.<br />Crackin' Rosie, however, is a great joke, and the band effortlessly walks the fine line betwen musical genius and parody. Good Times, Bad Times is right on. Sleeping Monkey is kind of out there; but how else would they end such a bizarre show?"
1533,5,"I also have managed to hang on to the MGM vinyl LP from 1965 and still love it. A few years ago I did transfer it to CD along with four Royalettes 45s and still listen to this CD often. It is that good and well worth adding to your collection - I just don't know why the price is so high.    I've heard all but two of the tracks and all are excellent. The other review was right on the money except I believe the album deserves a full 5 star rating.    If you love the old girl groups and beautiful music and can justify the price, you're going to love this CD! I can't imagine a more desirable addition to your music collection.      Update: 9/28/2005    I finally bought both Import CDs of the Royalettes MGM LPs from 1965-66 - \\""It's Gonna Take a Miracle\\"" and \\""The Elegant Sound of the Royalettes\\"". Expensive, but I'm very glad I did! Both CDs were made in Japan so the booklets are in Japanese but fortunately the lyrics are included in English. More importantly, the CD transfer is excellent - I doubt anyone has heard these gems sounding better!    Both CDs easily deserve 5 stars. They just are incredible with few weak tracks. Sheila Ross has a powerful and distinctive voice while the backing vocals are perfect. Teddy Randazzo's arrangements are as good as it gets and almost every song is topnotch. I have no idea why The Royalettes didn't have commercial success that rivaled The Supremes and Dionne Warwick. In his review, Larry Jones nailed it with his quote \\""Historic and criminally underrated music.\\"" I wish more people had been like me - I bought all of their singles and the first LP. (Went into the Army in 1966 and unfortunately missed the second LP.)    I've copied all 30 tracks to an 80 minute CD-R (they fit with 29 seconds to spare!) and now I can listen to my treasured \\""It's Gonna Take a Miracle\\"" and new friend \\""The Elegant Sound of the Royalettes\\"" any time I want. Of course they're on my MP3 player, too. Life is good...    Now on to \\""It's Gonna Take a Miracle\\"" - in my opinion the only weak track is \\""Out Of Sight, Out Of Mind\\"" which is incredible considering that there are 14 tracks! (The original LP has the first 12 tracks while this CD adds the bonus tracks \\""(He Is) My Man\\"" and \\""Take My Love (And Hide It From My Heart)\\"" taken from a 1966 single. (Interestingly both bonus songs were written by Bill Medley of The Righteous Brothers.) It's hard to think of many albums of any era that have so many great tracks!    Eight of the tracks are in mono, the rest are stereo. This has nothing to do with the CD transfer as my 1966 LP is in stereo yet the same tracks play mono no matter what it says on the record jacket. And most singles from the 60s were mono so it's no surprise the bonus tracks are mono. But what a pleasure to hear this terrific music with such fidelity and no pops and clicks!    Highly recommended. And if you like the girl groups, this CD is a must-have for your collection."
1534,5,"It's simple really: put this disk in your player and see how many times you listen to it continuously, it's going to be more than twice.  This is the kind of disk that you play over and over again.  There is nothing particularly innovative about this disk (that is - outside of charting the self-contained development of Mobb Deep's own sound) but Havoc and Prodigy blend seamlessly with the minimal but stellar production.  Almost every song is well crafted, lyrically and musically.  The inspired beats crackle with energy and all the songs are laced with choruses that make you want shout and gangsta stomp.  I freestyle over this record all the time- the groveling baselines just propel the voice.  This album has it's own flow that pulls you like an undertow you just can't escape.  Drown to this."
1535,5,Truly one of the best albums I have heard in a long time. I don't even mind that you can hear her fingers running on the strings with every cord change because it's so good.
1536,5,"This is a great album.  People always ask what I'm playing when I have this on.  It has a lot in common with the downbeat realm of Zero 7, Thievery Corp, etc, but with a solid hip hop sensibility underlying that manifests through head noddable beats and a sound that is a little harder and rawer than the above listed groups, but in a very good way.  He uses a few vocal samples, all of which are deftly incorporated and make you want more, but for the most part it's pure instrumental.  Jel definitely pulls in sounds from realms outside of the usual hip hop cannon, and avoids the traps of monotony that most hip hop instrumental projects suffer from.  No matter how bangin' a beat is, you're going to get bored after a couple listens to a 4 minute track that doesn't work transitions.  Jel knows this and he alternately keeps his songs short, or gives them plenty of transitions to maintain freshness.<br />This album is definitely the place to start for Jel.  10 Seconds is good, but Greenball is better.  He's also responsible for production on albums by \\""Them\\"" with rapper Dose One.  I like some of that, and Dose One's verse on the Deep Puddle Dynamics track \\""The Scarecrow Speaks\\"" is brilliant, but on the whole I much prefer to hear Jel's music stand alone, and this album is the one.  Don't sweat the lack of reviews, trust me, get it.<br />Petestrumentals is the only other hip hop instrumental album that I really listen to, and I like Greenball better.  Less jazzy, but more varied and eclectic, and the pacing is brilliant.  I don't skip a single track."
1537,3,"Please, please, let's not kid ourselves, there is nothing new or revolutionary in this album ; there is clearly the influence of Sonic youth or Joy division in it and just because Bilinda Butcher has an interesting voice, this does not just justify the praise I have been reading about this band.<BR>It's good stuff but it's not outstanding.<BR>Where were most of the reviewers in the 80's ??? Not born I guess."
1538,4,"I remember first hearing Linda Ronstadt's amazing voice come crashing out of the radio sometime in the late sixties as the lead vocalist for the folk-rock group, the Stone Ponies. Her distinctive melodic scream of a vocal style is so distinctive it is hard not to compare with Roy Orbison, whose songs she sometimes recorded, as with \\""Blue Bayou\\"", which is included here. This collection of her hit songs covers the decade or so before she went for the big band and \\""lush\\"" sounds of her more recent work. It is hard to not appreciate a voice so singular and versatile, even if it is most usually delivered with a fevered wail. I once saw her in a small venue in Lenox, Massachusetts in a small amphitheater setting, with the audience sprawled over an expansive lawn that gradually rose above the covered stage area. She was so good with just her guitar and small group that it is difficult to describe her in words short of superlatives such as phenomenal.<br />Much of her seminal work is included here for you casual enjoyment, from \\""Hurt So Bad\\"" to \\""Back In The USA\\"", from \\""Poor. Poor Pitiful Me\\"" to \\""It's So Easy\\"", and all the others, including \\""Just One Look\\"", \\""Tumbling Dice\\"", \\""Oh, Baby, Baby\\"", \\""Someone To lay Down beside Me\\"", and several others. This album give us many of Linda's formidable hits, with a definitive play list that anyone would want to have to ensure an accurate representation of her volumes of work, from dozens of hit albums recorded and released over more than a decade of popular work. This is an essential album for your collection, and one I have both in the house and in the car. For easy listening as I zoom down the highway. Other than the Beach Boys, on the one hand, or Jackson Browne on the other, nobody articulates the southern California folk rock style as well or as consistently as Linda Ronstadt, the little woman with the big, big voice. Enjoy!"
1539,4,Buy this and remember where you were when it came out.  Good to remember what we where protesting then.
1540,5,"My 20 month old daughter cannot get enough of this cd. She cries if we try to sneak in a different cd! She's learned all of the dances by watching the show and when I put the cd in she does all of the dances with the songs. I would most defintely recommend this cd, it's stops many tantrums! The Wiggles are geniuses!!"
1541,5,"Time Warp brought together the best of the science fiction world. Everything on this cd is classic. The Alien closing title, &quot;The Menagerie,&quot; and my favorite, &quot;Also Sprach Zarathustra.&quot;<br />Although Strauss' renewed version of &quot;On the Beautiful Blue Danube&quot; isn't as good as the original, it is definatley great. I think only Dorsey's &quot;Ascent&quot; was a let down. I did not enjoy that piece.<br />Richard Strauss' &quot;Also Sprach Zarathustra from &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; is brilliant. The entire cd is full of artistic minds."
1542,5,"This CD has much more to offer than your typical Nashville product. Jon's music tells stories of life in the west, past and present.With his rich vocals and better than average instumental talents this is a must hear CD. I would also highly recommend the two western novels that Jon has wriiten, The Spanish Peaks and Wyoming Wind."
1543,5,"... even my son (7 years old ) likes it!<br />I wonder how much pop culture has actually flown into this piece of otherwise 'classical' music. Amazing, how 'electronic' the pieces sometimes sound; I had to read the liner notes several times, to find only pianos, marimbas, vibraphones, xylophones, maracas, violins, celli, bass clarinets, clarinets, altos, sopranos... It reminds me at at times of Mike Oldfield's \\""Tubular Bells\\"" or Jean-Michel Jarre's \\""Equinoxe\\"" or \\""Oxygene\\""...<br />Nevertheless: Wonderful music, many colors and timbres riding on a smart and original minimalistic (may SR forgive me!) backbone of rhythm and pulse. At the end of the day of course: Hands down, five stars, for both, composition and performance (with composer!)."
1544,5,"I have been a fan of Westlife for four (4) years and will probably be for a long time. Their ballads are just heart-warming and meaningful--songs that just touch the heart.<br />&quot;I Have A Dream,&quot; I always wonder what compelled them to make a revival of this song. Nonetheless, they have great voices, thus a great revival.<BR><br />For &quot;Flying Without Wings,&quot; a great, teary-eyed song that has them give you the feel of it. You can tell it def. came from the heart!<BR><br />&quot;Uptown Girl&quot; (a Billy Joel original) 8.5/10, &quot;World of Our Own&quot; 8.5/10, &quot;Bop Bop Baby&quot; 6.5/10, and &quot;When You're Looking Like That&quot; 7.5/10, will have you thinking if you bought the right album because all these songs are upbeat! Once again, they have great vocals and have meaningful words. But as for &quot;Bop Bop Baby,&quot; the title kind of swayed me at first, but the words are way different from the title. It's a song with spunk packed with an upbeat mix.<BR><br />&quot;Written In The Stars&quot; is a great ballad. A song that will reach out to you and wish you had the one you love dedicate and sing this for you. A real stunner for the ladies. 10/10<BR><br />&quot;How Does It Feel&quot; is just like a normal Westlife ballad but much more mature. To those that are new to a Westlife ballad, this song relates to the questioning of how it feels about certain things relating to the relationship. 6/10<BR><br />&quot;Tonight&quot; is a &quot;puts-you-up&quot; song. At first they sing slow and low and after the second verse, then they start to sing with feeling. 9/10<BR><br />&quot;Love Takes Two&quot; is a song that has meaning to it. It comes from within and you will be able to experience that when it comes to the bridge. 8/10<BR><br />&quot;Miss You Nights,&quot; when I first heard it, I thought it was horrible. I was contemplating whether my hearing was wrong or it was just my stereo. This is not one of their best...they even recently said that they did not want to use this song. But, once you get used to it, it has great vocals as well. I just can't count it for the tune and how they express it. 3/10<BR><br />&quot;Flying Without Wings&quot; ft. BoA is an &quot;okay&quot; song. BoA doesn't sing very much, but it is still a wonderful. 7.5/10<BR><br />For the remaining Westlife songs that I didn't type about are great--that's why they've been added to their Greatest Hits Album! :D All Westlife needs now is time and devotion here for the USA. They aren't that popular here so they REALLY need excellent promotional advertisements to get them going. I recommend this album to everyone, esp. those that are romantics! :)"
1545,5,"all i have to say is that this cd is amazing!!!  awesome rock ting to it!!!!  i first heard peter stuart in the movie, \\""all over the guy.\\""  it had the songs \\""real you\\"" and \\""bring you back,\\"" which i completley fell in love with...rite after the movie, i went and looked up his album and bought it!!!!  i have no regrets whatsoever...oh, and yes, it is an awesome driving cd!!!!!"
1546,5,"Bases Covered is definitely a grand slam. <BR>I had the fortunate privilege to hear Bernard live one Sunday as he performed with the phenomenal music ministry at my church, Mt Sinai Church-Austell, GA. A member of our Praise Ensemble, I noticed with my eyes that we had a guest musician, but then I noticed with my ears how extremely talented he was. <BR>It was only after I purchased and listened to  Basses Covered, that I realized that I had a brush with greatness.<BR>Not since Jimmy Haslip of the YellowJackets, have a heard such a combination of sweetness, jazz, funk, lyrical and creative stylings strum through the fingers of a bassist.<BR>DEFINITELY PURCHASE THIS PROJECT!!!<BR>Bernard Harris truly is a star on the not too distant horizon."
1547,4,"This is a really difficult review for me to write. I have been, and still am, an ardent supporter of the work of these two gentlemen, for many years. Wowed and zowed by their albums since day one.<br />I have played this album over and over, like other reviewers. I have played it softly and loudly, on OK sytems and good sytems. I have listened to it intently and as just music in the car.<br />It has everything one could wish for, great tunes, great lyrics, humor and pathos, fine singing, fine musicianship. It is well crafted with all of those great little flourishes and restraints. There are some awesome pieces hidden away in the overall sound.<br />There is not a bad or second rate apect to this whole album. It has progressed from the last but seems a logical extension of it.<br />You would think it is the perfect Steely Dan album. A sublime piece of excellence.<br />But I cannot help but feel that something is missing. It nags away at me on every listen but I cannot put my finger on the cause.<br />Maybe it needs a little touch of the serpent."
1548,3,"I love Stan Getz, and &quot;Cool Sounds&quot; is a collection of great music he made between 1953-55.  But the release of this limited edition CD is definitely not cool!  The reason is that the disc's first four tracks have already been released as bonus tracks on the CD of &quot;West Coast Jazz&quot; (see my review).  See, when &quot;Cool Sounds&quot; originally came out on vinyl, it was a collection of outtakes and abbreviated sessions packaged together to further capitalize on Getz's soaring popularity.  But now in the era of the compact disc, these selections should be issued as bonus tracks along with other material recorded at the time of their creation, as was already done on &quot;West Coast Jazz.&quot;  What the folks at Verve should have done instead of reissuing &quot;Cool Sounds&quot; was reissue the long out-of-print &quot;More West Coast Jazz,&quot; and include tracks 5-9 from this disc as bonus tracks.  Now that would have been cool!"
1549,5,If you don't like Grind/Death metal then you won't like this but if you do then this is the album for you. The best thing about this album is the choice of some more obscure Sabbath tracks like<BR>Zero The Hero and Lord Of This World.
1550,5,"I'm not much of a Christina fan, just for lack in taste of that bubble gum type of pop. Aside from her explicit taste in clothing I never understood peoples hate towards her. This song is very beautiful and gives out a good message to young girls redeeming herself from the not-so-tasty: Dirty video. It's a great song worth listening to."
1551,5,"This might be the best cd I own.  These guys are simply amazing.  The best songs are probably tracks 1-3 and 10 &amp; 11.  The guitars are screaming, drums pounding, and lyrics emotional and heartfelt.  Some songs have powerful sing-alongs (tracks 2 and 7 esp.) while others give you a warm feeling inside (tracks 3 and 10 esp.).  If you don't have this albulm, get it because there may be none better."
1552,5,"I was glad once i heard this, it was refreshing to hear a new female artist who doesnt sound like everyone else. I can't say that i don't like any song on this cd, she also put out another cd in 2002 called More B.S which is also real good. It also has a cover of the boys of summer which is nicely done ! 5 stars !"
1553,5,"This is one of those &quot;every song could be a single&quot; albums.  There aren't many albums like that.  Def Leppard's Hysteria, the Stone Roses debut...all I can think of right now.<br />JAMC was an incendiary band, coming out of nowhere preaching a gospel of teenage girls and unhealthy living over the fuzz of a few chords and a pedestrian drumbeat.  Their debut is a justifiable classic and far from a pop masterpiece.  Honey's Dead lacks the danger and crude frantic energy of Psychocandy, but the slick production and clear melodic vocals make for an altogether addictive experience.<br />Automatic gets a lot of praise, but you get the feeling after hearing Honey's Dead that Alan Moulder was just getting a feel for the band.  The guitar hooks are more immediate on Honey's Dead, the moods are sharper, the lyrics deliciously simpler.  There might not be a song as great as Head On, but you won't find any filler on Honey's Dead.  And Monti, the drummer, provides the best early 90's beats this side of Loz.<br />In a just world this album would have sold millions of copies in America.  Buy it, then tell all your friends to do the same."
1554,5,"LZ3 is the quintessential Zep album. It announces to the world that the underrated heavy rockers can play in any style from Indian sitar to Blues Slide. As one critic wrote, LZ3 is a complete experience from one end to another, an odyssey of the mind."
1555,5,"I have heard both Trent Reznor's and Johnny Cash's versions of HURT.  Trent's version speaks from a young person's point of view and is fine...but in the hands...and voice...and soul of Johnny Cash, it takes on a resonance and meaning that NIN can't even begin to touch.  I have seen the video and listened to the song numerous times and I cry every time.  It is particularly heart wrenching now that June has passed...Everyone I know goes away in the end...how much more than one man take?<br />The other songs are good...and the album is superior...but I honestly listen to it for HURT.  This album is the crowning touch to a phenomenal career but HURT is the diamond in the crown...his whole life in one song.  People need to get over categorizations.  This is brilliant MUSIC, no matter what the genre.  This is a brilliant musician.  He does not have the best singing voice, but his vocals have more soul in them than ANYONE else out there now.  I would put him with Billie Holliday when it comes to singing from the very core of being.<br />Singers like Johnny come our way so infrequently...we need to hold on to him as long as we can."
1556,4,"Emotionally raw vocal delivery coupled with decent driving background. It's on the lighter side musically, but the vocalist makes the music sound more emotionally resonant at times. He sounds distraught, or bittersweetly happy. Solid album of songs that you might not listen to with a full sitting, but still good."
1557,3,"Or file under eletro schlock... Do not beleive the hype of this being a punked out beat driven mother of a record. What punk sound it has is sampled, and repetitive at best. I'm sorry, but when I think of punk, I think hardcore, and this ain't hardcore. The beats? Big fat beats, which change very little from song to song. I will admit the beats are sleazy sounding, but whoopty doo. The lyrics? [NOT GOOD], in an I'm 16 years old mom and dad, and this is what I like to offend you with! A good example of the lyrics is when she belts out \\""gimme your wad.\\"" No joke, she says it, but none the less funny to hear. All in all, it is good for a laugh, just don't take it too seriously. If you want the punked out beat driven mother, get Black Cat #13, just don't expect any witty lyrics about \\""giving your wad.\\"""
1558,4,"This is Not what I expected, however this is a good C.D.  The Score From the Movie is a pretty good Score.  you are all Complaining because it's not the the Soundtrack Soundtrack, but a lot of good movies Don't always put out the Soundtrack soundtrack.  By the way whoever said you can download the music from the movies' website was seriously mistaken I have been on. The Website and can't find a thing about Downloading the music from it.  Also Whoever wrote the complaint to Universal Studio's Wrote there complaint to the wrong Movie Production Company they need to write it to warner Bros.  Who actually put out the movie, or to Castlerock Entertainment who was also intrumental in putting out this Movie."
1559,5,"While many artists come under intense criticism when they cross from the secular to the sacred, Aretha Franklin is unique in that she can just about do it all. After three decades, Franklin's &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; stands as one of the greatest gospel recordings of all time.<br />As an &quot;essential&quot; for the fan of both the singer and gospel music, there is not a wasted cut on this release. Franklin takes Marvin Gaye's passionate &quot;Wholy Holy&quot; to an entirely stratospheric level while James Taylor's &quot;You've Got a Friend&quot; transcends its pop beginnings. &quot;How I Got Over&quot; and &quot;Climbing Higher Mountains&quot; can literally &quot;raise the dead&quot; in their respective thunderous executions by Franklin and the Southern California Choir.<br />But &quot;Precious Memories&quot; and &quot;Mary, Don't You Weep&quot; are unparalleled as examples of the majesty and power of Black gospel.<br />One can't get any better than this and the current crop of hip-hop friendly gospel singers need to return to their roots...specifically THIS album."
1560,5,"Your travel guide for this Texas trip is john Arthur martinez, recently a contestant on Nashville Star. This is the third of his independantly releassed CD's, and the most diverse of the three. Your first stop is a dance hall outside of Austin, Texas, where you can listen to the upbeat Western Swing tune &quot;A Girl Named Texas&quot;. If you are very fast on your feet, you may be able to keep up with john Arthur's &quot;Armadillo Song&quot; a tounge-twister of a ditty sung at breakneck speed. This is the song that wowed the Nashville Star croud during the finale episode. To cool yourself off, enjoy two slow dance numbers, &quot;Show Me&quot; and &quot;Every Day is Christmas&quot;. AS you leave the Dance hall, you drive along through the country roads and small towns of the Texas Hill Country; enjoy the songs of small town life &quot;Here's to the Boys&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Holds the Bow&quot;. These songs evoke the charm and heart to be found in friends and family. Visit the San Antonio Riverwalk in the Spanish &quot;Rio Amour&quot; (The River of Love). This tune is to be in the move &quot;Box of Miracles&quot;. Ladies, hold on to something sturdy when you listen to this one...a friend tells me her knees turn to jelly when she hears john Arthur sing a romantic spanish song. And this sure is one. &quot;Married to Your Memory&quot; is perhaps the most traditional Country-type tune on the CD. There's no room to describe all the great music on this CD- listen after the last track for a hidden fun song. All in all, the best Country/Western CD I have heard in the last 10 years."
1561,5,"if this single is any indication of their upcoming album, then it was worth the wait. \\""Me and You\\"" is Camouflage's best single in years. the radio version(track #1) and f.e.o.s version (track 2) are the best mixes here and actually are the best mixes of this song because there is also a cd2 with more dance versions. but these are the best on cd1. also included on this cd single is a non album track called \\""Perfect\\"".it is track #4. and quite honestly could have been it's own single, because it is a very strong cong- actually maybe better than \\""Me and You\\"". my only wish would be to have Camouflage release their album in the USA so that more people would be exposed to their music. One thing that's for sure--Marcus Meyn (the lead singer)--has, without a doubt, the [nicest] male voice I have ever heard. And that's a fact."
1562,5,"David Bisbals voice is beautiful and all the songs are great, the latin'dance type ones as well as the ballads. If you get hold of the CD + DVD you will then be able to see how David got started on Operacion Triunfo and earned the hearts of millions of people in Spain. He really is a charming guy and a great singer and I am sure he will grow more and more successful over the next few years! Compradlo!"
1563,5,this is the best cd ive ever bought. its just so amazing. get it.
1564,5,"The Yardbirds are back. This album was worth getting just to listen to some of the best guitarists of all time rock on some of my favorite Yardbirds tracks. The album has 8 of their classic songs, and 7 new ones. The new recordings sound great, most of them are pretty dead on from the originals. `For your love,' is my favorite on the album. Johnny Rzeznik does an excellent job with the vocals. I suggest you take a listen to this song if you can. Another standout track is `Over Under Sideways Down' with Slash on guitar. Slash also does a great job on this track, and his solo at the end is awesome. You'll want to crank up the volume for this one. Birdland just reaffirms why this band was so great back in the 60's, and I highly recommend it. It's just great, classic rock n' roll."
1565,5,yes this band is awsome and is truly evil incarnate.this album has an interesting sound because they play nothing but bass(one 5 string and one 8 string)with the only guitars being the solos so it sounds very dark and raunchy it kicks ....
1566,5,"When I saw this on PBS, I knew I needed to have it in my collection.  Sadly, I have not been able to find it in video form.  Don't get me wrong, the CD is excellent!  Unfortunately it doesn't do justice to seeing the performances.  Morgan Freeman, Carl Lumbly, The Five Blind Boys, The Steele Family, gave truly inspring performances!  If anyone has this in video format, please, please make it available for others to see.  Classic does not begin to describe this performance."
1567,5,"...One being to imagine what it was like being a Miles fan or Jazz fan at the time, and hearing it in that context, or viewing it now, as 30+ years have passed and that this is just an historical musical document.  Well, since I was born in '74, option 1 is not an option for me, so I'll have to tell you that this album, when I first heard it totally blew me away.  I love Miles, I love Jazz, and I love funk.  But this was just hardcore groove-funk music, and when it first made its way into my CD player, I couldn't stop.  Forget about the other stuff that Miles was doing at the time or before (although this IS a logical extension of where he had been heading), and just listen to this sucker.  And twist one up, cuz this is someheavy ..."
1568,5,"If you're a fan of 80's Hair Metal, this album is for you."
1569,5,"This CD compilation is wondrous.  It starts off slow, a very sort of ascetic trance.  From there it slowly but progressively builds in terms of the evolution of the music itself and what begins to happen inside of your mind.  Soon you realize that you are in a place full of sensuous melodies and reflective imagninings.  Your thoughts unconsciously evolve along with the music and both expand from a single tune or idea if you will, into a rich exploration of layer upon layer of musical composition and the thoughts and fantasies they evoke.  Through this method, you end up in a tapestry of magical experience, and you are transformed and come out on the other end profoundly satisfied because the music itself has become a symbol of deeper things within and without that are beyond our understanding.  It's wonderfully Jungian, and the best thing about it is that I'm sure Digweed didn't consciously intend it this way, it's simply something he was called to create from within his own unconscious (and thereby it speaks to ours as well).  Despite it being trance and/or house music (whatever you want to call it), I truly feel that it is the highest art yet that Digweed has put together.  I highly recommend purchasing this CD."
1570,5,"Celine Dion is one of the best singers in my opinion. This CD is a little different than others because she isn't as vocal in many of the songs. They are more toned down, but that doesn't make the CD less enjoyable. My favorite songs are &quot;I Drove All Night,&quot; &quot;Faith,&quot; &quot;One Heart,&quot; and &quot;Coulda Shoulda Woulda.&quot; I am overall very pleased with this CD and I do reccommend it to any Celine Fan."
1571,5,"Being a teenager, adults think that all I listen to is rap but in reality I own not just rap albums but Madonna, Prince, Cyndi Lauper, Janet and Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston albums, albums that were popular when only I was a tiny thing. I find this Madonna album to be one of my favorites, one I even push Missy Elliot's aside (horror of horrors!). &quot;True Blue&quot; is 80's pop at it's best, I just love it. Madonna really sells the hit &quot;Papa Don't Preach&quot; with the screaming chorus and truthful words. &quot;Open Your Heart&quot; is a hard hitting track that is another one of my favorites. &quot;White Heat&quot; I really like besides the corny talking bit it's actully a well crafted song. My all-time fave Madonna song has to be &quot;Live To Tell&quot;. It is a beautiful song from start to finish, the music is incredible, the faraway keyboard mixing with the guitar (sorry if I'm gushing) but this song ROCKS! &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot; is another favorite of mine. The chorus is real catchy. &quot;True Blue&quot;, &quot;Where's The Party&quot; and &quot;Love Makes The World Go 'Round&quot; are pretty sizeable, I listen to them as well but I think &quot;Jimmy, Jimmy&quot; is kinda &quot;Stupid, Stupid&quot;. This is an awesome album, one that should be in every music fan's collection. I recommend it, after all it is Madonna."
1572,5,"ok now, i've read all these reviews, and heard this cd trashed and praised.  and quite frankly, this cd is amazing!  while burn my eyes hooked me on to MH a few years back, this cd kept me with em, it really showed diversity in their music, and alot more talent.  The lyrics are deep, the ballads are amazing, and even the more raplike songs(from this day, desire to fire) are actually, for lack of a better word, amazing songs.  The music is powerful, a little weak at guitar because of the change, but overall good.    But i do believe that they need to go back to the heavier stuff, this is a cd worth buying, i've never gotten sick of listenin to it."
1573,5,"This CD is absolutely incredible. The music mixes beautifully orchestrated strings with a hard rock influence. The lyrics are extremely moving and sung with such a lovely voice by Amy Lee. This is a must for anyone looking for something new, exciting and fantastic. If you end up loving this CD, also look into a CD called 5:30 Saturday Morning by a girl called Lennon. It's the same type of music with hauntingly beautiful lyrics sung by a rich voice. Happy listening!"
1574,4,"Getz' sound has a sweet edge that speaks to me like no other sax voice. If you've never heard much Stan Getz, this will get you a superb sampling. If you're already a fan, these Joe Henderson picked selections will thrill you.<br />The variety of styles on this CD makes listening even more exciting. Dizzy's exhilarating contributions heard here should be mentioned as well. <br />A co-worker lent me this CD at the office today. Tonight, its going on my wish list."
1575,4,"nearly all these songs were top radio hits, mostly because they're very catchy and the lyrics are clever. this was really the album that got me interested in No Doubt, but I accidentally bought Tragic Kingdom first (definitely recommend that one too!)."
1576,5,"seriously, i know they're on drive thru - but don't judge them based on that.  i know they're not like the rest of the d-t bands - so deal with it.  and do yourself a favor - go pick up a smiths cd.  i can appreciate d-t bands as much as the next guy, but do yourself a favor and broaden your horizons.  that is what steel train should do for you.  they're a fantastic band, and they do the best smiths-type jam since the smiths.  seriously.  a fantastic band, and one who will have far more staying power than the current &quot;hot&quot; acts on d-t..."
1577,5,This is an awesome song. I've been waiting for almost 5 months for this record to come out.  I'm so excited that is here.  Thanks Chris... love ur music man! keep it up.  God bless u.
1578,4,"This CD is right for you if you want 2 britney remixes.First song is the original Born to make you happy,The second is a another recorded version remix to born to make you happy.Then there's a crazy Remix and last but not least the baby one more time answering Machine.I think it's a pretty neat CD.<BR>The album consist of 4 songs."
1579,1,"What a disappointment.  The lyrics are sophmoric and the production shallow and trite.  By the fourth or fifth song, I just want the words to stop, the music to stop even more. Beautiful voice, though, as always...makes it even harder for your ears to reconcile with such an awful presentation."
1580,5,"AAR is the most awesome new band! There debut album is great, every song i like, especially number 1 &quot;paper heart&quot;!! &quot;Swing Swing&quot; is also another good song. I first heard it on TRL and ever since then I have been in love with The All-American Rejects, if you haven't bought the cd yet, you should! You'll be sorry if you don't, it absolutly rocks!"
1581,5,"This cd is awesome, i have been waiting for the new release ever since i heard about Jason's coming to the band.  His work in Affinity was great and i was anxious to hear the new sound.  I was impressed with every song on the album, especially &quot;a blank page empire&quot;, &quot;the sound&quot;, and &quot;on legendary&quot;.  This is a must have album"
1582,4,"I heard this one for the first time in early 85 and I was floored. I was listening to bands like Twisted Sister, Ratt and Motley Crue at the time and I expected WASP to be along those lines. They were to some extent, but they had a harder edge. I listened to this album over and over at the time and I still listen to it every once in awhile. My favorite songs are School Daze, The torture never stops, I wanna be somebody and Sleeping in the fire. This was their best album until the did Headless children five years later."
1583,4,"Curb Records has been issuing Osmond Brothers compilation CD's for years now and have always managed to miss the mark to some degree.  Here, as one in the Millenium series of basic greatest hits collections, Universal Music offers another compilation CD of Osmond tunes that almost gets it right, at least from a comprehensive hits package standpoint.    In its favor is the inclusion of \\""I Can't Stop\\"", a tune originally from '67, reissued in '71 to capitalize on the newly established popularity of \\""One Bad Apple\\"".  The compilers opted to include \\""He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother\\"" the b-side of \\""...Apple\\"", in favor of the Osmonds last charting tune, \\""I Can't Live A Dream\\"" from '76.  In itself, this is not a major faux pas as this track is found on other Osmond collections, but for collectors it may be a debatable decision for a \\""Best-of\\"" series.    Quibbles nothwithstanding, this piece does offer a solid overview of the Osmonds' singles sporting generally excellent sound with all tracks in stereo except 11, the aforementioned \\""I Can't Stop\\"", in mono.  Complemented by an eight-page flopover liner notes booklet, this piece represents the best of the greatest hits lot at a reasonable price and is preferable to most, if not all, of the previous Curb single Osmond Brothers CD's.  For the fan, this is the best bet so far."
1584,5,"this album is excellent. i can't imagine aloha getting any better than this cd, but they already have surpassed any expectations i have had for indie bands in a long time. the vibraphone and conga drums add depth and originality to their songs and bass lines that have been compared to dismemberment plan give their songs a great jazzy feel. the songs have excellent compositions and blend together so well making the entire album just a great piece of ear candy (hahaha) <BR>just to let you know, that if my life were a movie, i would choose this as my backdrop music. if anyone from aloha reads this review, i really want you to tour with tristeza or sea and cake. its a good idea trust me!"
1585,5,"Diana's previous collection of very romantic love songs had been so successful that the formula was repeated. However, there is nothing formulaic about the quality of this album, which is every bit as good as Love scenes.<br />Again, the songs were chosen from the Great American songbook. Many of the songs were originally American hits in the twenties and thirties, including Let's face the music and dance (Fred Astaire), Devil may care (Glenn Miller), Let's fall in love (Eddy Duchin), When I look in your eyes (Hunter Rodeheaver and Virginia Asher), I've got you under my skin (Ray Noble), I can't give you anything but love (Cliff Edwards, Ben Selvin and Johnny Hamp all had huge hits with it), I'll string along with you (Ted Fio Rito), East of the sun (Tom Coakley), Pick yourself up (Fred Astaire) and Do it again (Paul Whiteman).<br />Some of these songs, like Let's face the music and dance, were originally more up-tempo, but here they are slowed right down, making them sound fresh and exciting. The original artists are mostly unknown these days - only Glenn Miller and Fred Astaire remain widely recognisable - but Diana and others are doing an excellent job of keeping their music alive and relevant to a modern generation."
1586,5,"The clear standout on this disc are the Hagen songs which, in their simple elegance and sophisticated execution, seem easy but are in fact quite challenging. Church is a fine singer and this is an excellent CD."
1587,5,"THIS ONE'S A KEEPER especially if you like good old funky blues, (and I do), this album will get you movin'.  It's rare to buy a CD and like all the selections but on this one I do.<BR>     Track 3 &quot;RIKKI&quot; is soulfully beautiful for just blissful <BR>              listening.<BR>     Track 4  This was a big hit for the late, great Eddy Harris<BR>              and if you have the guts to follow Harris's sax on<BR>              &quot;LISTEN HERE&quot; you just better be David Sanborn.<BR>And then of course there's Track 5  &quot;SPOOKY&quot; and it just doesn't get any better than that.  It's classic R&amp;B Sanborn.<BR>     Track 6  &quot;MISSING YOU&quot;  Once again we slow the tempo for an incredible blues.  He pours his soul into this rendition and again demonstrates his amazing command of the alto sax. I can get lost in this one.<br />I do think my favorite is the final track &quot;SOUTHERN EXPOSURE&quot;.  It has that &quot;get down&quot; funky feel that Sanborn does so well and  nobody else can match---guaranteed to get you up and goin'!<BR>  <BR>Four final words of wisdom       BUY IT AND ENJOY!"
1588,5,"There is an overlooked gem on this album. It is the song \\""Fly Away\\"", an eerie, hauntingly beautiful song with Olivia Newton-John adding a backing vocal to create an etheral effect.You can easily identify the woman singing the title phrase in response to John Denver, and her contribution helped \\""Fly Away\\"" to become a hit.Reaching #1 AC, \\""Fly Away\\"" reached #13 on the Pop charts and #12 on the Country charts after its release September, 1975. In the Spring of 1975 somewhere above The Rocky Mountains, I met a beautiful woman named Sandy and we experienced \\""love-at-first-sight\\"". We drank some wine and \\""made out\\"" in the back seat of an airplane bound for Los Angeles. Once I returned back to the ground the affair ended in tragedy and I walked away with a broken heart.The first time I heard \\""Fly Away\\"" it instantly reminded me of my lost love Sandy and I cried. Today, 28 years later the song still has the same affect on me."
1589,4,"My 2 cents worth is I hate the song &quot;Woman Lose Weight&quot; and I don't find it humorous.  Lyrics aside, it doesn't even musically appeal to me.<br />I still say get the CD.  The rest of the CD more than makes up for one bad song.  Just simply skip &quot;Woman Lose Weight&quot;."
1590,5,"I bought this CD after downloading the sample songs.  I was not disappointed!  I love this CD in all its soft darkness(which may not be some people's cup of tea).  I've had it in my CD player in the office for two straight months and have yet to tire of it.  A very good buy, esp if you liked the samples!"
1591,5,"I think this album is one of the most underrated albums in the rock history. Everybody knows the Journey work of the Steve Perry's era, in which all albums are much more commercially oriented. NEXT is a solid piece of innovative, experimental and almost progressive rock music, but remarkable here is the pleasant songwriting work of this album. We have a real nice instrumental song (Nickel and Dime), a pop song gem (Spaceman), energetic rockers (Karma, People), all we need to got a very pleasant and enjoyable listening of a real rock album, despite it's not very well produced and recorded - due limitations of that time. Neal Schon is one of the most talented guitars players of all time; Greg Rollie did a spetacular job with organ and voice, his organ fills are powerful; Ross Valory contributes well with a well crafted and delicate bass harmonies (also known because of his funny live performances); and maybe the only weak part of the personnel is A. Dunbar, a very common rock drummer that really didn't ruins everything but it wasn't an real addictive for the group's sound. Anyway it is a very fine piece of rock music, worthwhile for everyone that didn't discover how good Journey was during it's obscure pre-Perry period. Have fun and give yourself a gift buying NEXT, the Journey forgotten album."
1592,5,"A lovely, sparkling set, with Connie &quot;Cricket from TV's 'Hawaiian Eye'&quot; Stevens luxuriously crooning away on 12 songs(should've been 13 on this disc, as they left out the non-LP B-side &quot;Little Sister&quot;, a fabulous song). &quot;Why Try To Change Me Now&quot; and &quot;The Trolley Song&quot; are also on &quot;Conchetta&quot;, but &quot;Sixteen Reasons&quot; is here, along with &quot;Lulu's Back In Town&quot;, a real kicker! Connie's ingratiating throughout. This CD never fails to lift my spirits. 'A'"
1593,3,"I fell in love with Jason's music a few months ago when I accidently stumbled upon his website. There I 'd downloaded \\""So Unusual\\"" I believe. This guy was amazing! His voice, the guitar, the percussion all blended into an excelent musical, yet amazingly fun, experience. When I read he was going to put out a full length studio album I ordered it the moment I could. I HAD to have it. What a bummer. This was nothing like the songs I'd heard. I'm not saying it's a bad album, but if you have heard this man live with Toca the percussionist (\\""The 6th member of the Jackson Five\\"") you'll be dissapointed in the talent wasted."
1594,3,"This good and overlooked band has much of the reminents of other UK bands that it follows, with such similar ounds of early U2, radiohead and Buckley. It's good album. If anything a bit slow and awkward in the begininning, to the point that it is hard to connect or really get into the music. But don't throw it out of your player yet. &quot;say Something&quot; is ultimately beautiful, along with songs like &quot;Sleep&quot; and &quot;Outside&quot; that just simply sound cool. A lot of intricate guitar work make this record seem easier and more hip to listen to. <BR>The basic truth is that, if you are into other UK bands like Starsailor and Coldplay that have gotten some or great recognition, then there is a good chance that you will find a home with this one.There might not be anything revolutionary here, but that does not demolish the fact that this is a solid debut, from a band that has promise."
1595,3,"Don't get me wrong,Derek Trucks can slide likes nobodys business but he drifted off on some strange trips about middleways through. Think twice before you buy it."
1596,5,"I chose this CD based on other reviews and was not disapointed. This music is just so much fun and it is great swing music. There is a nice combination of instrumental tracks with  upbeat tempos, and several tracks with great jazz singing. The one main point of difference from Bill Elliot from other swing bands is quality. It brings to mind the original masters of swing such as Glen Miller. Very smooth music, it really is beautiful, fun music. Ten out of ten."
1597,5,"This cd is like a piece of history. It can never be duplicated and remains a recorded example of the life of one dynamic individual. The songs are a collection of her choice ,in music, and sings them with all the excitement and emotion one could ever hope for. This is a &quot;feel good&quot; cd and will leave you with a smile of satisfaction on your face."
1598,1,"very annoying tune,lyrics and chorus.this song is really bad.avoid at all costs."
1599,4,"Charmbracelet is not about Mariah proving to us that she can produce number one hits at will (as if the 90's weren't enough).  Instead, Mariah has shown us her versatility as an artist in Charmbracelet.  Mariah escorts us through an audio journey of emotions, each track reminding us of what it means to be human.  Her songs carry us in many ways, whether making it through the rain or when we found the one.   <br />Mariah has reassured us, in Charmbracelet, that the powerhouse of talent that she is stands steadfastly after a turbulent year.  Charmbracelet is one of the few Mariah albums where you can play tracks 1 through 15 straight through without wanting to press the skip button.  Granted, there is no one particular song that screams number one, this album is an accumulation of very very wholesome, talented, and pleasurable tracks.  There is a little something for everyone.<br />Mariah has shown us that she is more than a ballad singer throughout her career, and Charmbracelet exposes us to the true dynamic of Mariah as a singer.  She starts her album off with a song that is almost an ode to spiritual well being in \\""Trough the Rain\\"", while constantly revisiting her hip-hop roots in \\""Boy (I Need You)\\"", \\""You Got Me\\"", and so forth.  Then, we are introduced to \\""Subtle Invitation\\"", a jazzy lil' number that showcases her sultry and tantalizing voice in a way that we are not accustomed to hearing.  Anyone who is religious or spiritual will deeply appreciate \\""My Saving Grace\\"".  While Mariah has tampered with hip-hop beats from the east coast, she exposes us to the west coast sounds in \\""Irresistible\\"" and \\""You Had Your Chance\\"".  And what Mariah album would be complete without a ballad like \\""I Only Wanted\\""?  <br />Mariah's album offers its listeners so much that this kind of versatility is probably comparable to compilation albums.  \\""The One\\"" may be the closest track to being platinum, sales wise, but Charmbracelet is a gleaming, glittery, pot of gold."
1600,4,"I'm really into Barrabas so I know I'll love this CD when I get it. However, I'm already disappointed by one glaring omission: Where is &quot;Along The Shore&quot;? If you're going to do a &quot;Best of...&quot;, you should be sure to include on of their VERY best."
1601,4,"This christmas album is nice,very nice. You must have it.<BR>but without Naturi, this is album is a bit sad.<br />My fav' songs are : Xmas in tha hood , Christmas party , aah hell na and Take you home."
1602,5,"This album I bought in  1980 and it hold up as her best record ever. The clash with the Chic producers over Diana's decision to remix the album herself and put her vocals up front must have worked because there is not a  bad track on here. The two huge hits are &quot;Upside Down&quot; and &quot;I'm Coming Out&quot; and they continue to be sampled by different rap songs 20+ years after they were released. There is nothing better than listening to Tony Thompson's drum solo on &quot;I'm Coming Out&quot;. &quot;My Old Piano&quot; was released in the UK only. &quot;Tenderness&quot;,&quot;Give Up&quot; and &quot;Have Fun(Again)&quot; are classic Chic disco and hold up well. This album has been played alot over the 22 years of ownership. Diana's best record."
1603,4,"A legendary '70s troubadour/country clown/stoner god/party animal,  Jerry Jeff was an icon 'way back when, and he's still kicking and touring and making great records today.  His independently-owned Tried and True label has had a great track record so far; Walker's new material is at least as good as any of his classic &quot;outlaw&quot; material on MCA... This 12-song sampler isn't quite as comprehensive as 2001's somewhat similar &quot;Ultimate Collection,&quot; but it's a fine set in and of itself.  Includes a surprising number of Jerry Jeff's raunchier cult classics, and will certainly do in a pinch.  Diehard fans will, of course, have to seek out the original albums, but anyone who just wants to get their feet wet and see what all the fuss is about will find this disc pretty useful.  I wish they could've included &quot;London Homesick Blues&quot; as well, but hey, you can't have everything!  This is a good look at  a warm, humorous performer with a very human persona."
1604,3,"It's an okay CD, I'm glad I bought it, I'm just dissapointed bc I know how much better it could have been. There are only 13 songs on the album, 3 of which aren't really songs. The Nelly Furtado track is useless, you wouldn't be able to tell Nelly was on it unless the Roots told us she was. I think \\""The Seed 2.0\\"" and \\""Thought at work\\"" rock, the rest are ho-hum. I'm not a big fan of the Jill Scott track, they could have picked a better song to feature her, like the song she did with them on the [two dollar] bill MTV joint.<br />The Roots have always been a live act band, trying to capture their magic in a studio has always been tough. (buy the roots live album, it's their best I think)."
1605,5,"Razorblade Romance is an excellent blend of hard rock with awesome melodies to create a cd that leaves you wondering where they thought up music like that.  The hard guitar riffs satisfy the rock loving listener while the synthesised add ins and poetic lyrics appeal to listeners not quite in tune with rock. Ville Volo also brings to the music a voice with a large range of really deep low pitches to high ringing tones, which enables the band to do an awesome job of covering Chris Issacs Wicked Game. While allowing them to create other awesome songs like &quot;right here in my arms&quot; and &quot;I love you, prelude to Tradgedy&quot;  This album all around rocks.  You won't regret buying it."
1606,5,"Just like his other cd's, tim does a great job of blending a mixture of great songs.  I especially like ragtop..Tim keeps making his cd's the best they can be!..You will enjoy listening to this one!..Can't wait for the next one!"
1607,5,"I grew up listening to the Op. 35 and even as a child I knew it was something special. At the time, the version I had was the old Heifetz (with the white bust of Tchaikovsky on the cover) and I wore it out. To this day, every time I hear the Op. 35 it captures my heart.<br />So finding a version that mirrors how I actually hear the piece in my mind became almost a personal mission. In fact, over the years, I believe that I have listened to performances from all the top names. And despite hearing Perlman, Mutter, Midori and all their fiddling friends, no one matched up to the interpretation that I always carried with me.<br />That was until Maxim Vengerov came along. I was not familiar with this performer at all when I purchased this CD. I quickly learned his name because, at last, here was a performer who heard this violin concerto as I did. It was a revelation for me.<br />The phrasing is exquisite, the mood perfect, the technical artistry unmatched, and the passion simply exudes from Vengerov's performance. Best of all, there is a certain playfulness to his performance that so many other performers have so completely failed to capture in their own interpretations. Throughout, Vengerov is in command. He was born to play the Op. 35. Backed by the able and willing Berliner Philharmoniker under the baton of Claudio Abbado, soloist and orchestra have an almost psychic rapport.<br />Sadly, I cannot comment on the quality of the Glazunov concerto included since I have no other reference. I can only assume that it, too, is definitive. The concerto itself is actually quite stirring, making it a good - albeit unique - pairing with the Tchaikovsky.<br />As for the sound of the recording, I must confess it loses a bit of low end in the Allegro. To my ears Vengerov's Strad seems distant at points due to what must be mic placement. This might explain some of the weakness in the lower frequencies. Still, the orchestra also seems weak in the lower registers, so perhaps there are other reasons. But these are minor quibbles that in no way detract from the CD.<br />As I look back at the criterion performance of my youth, the Heifetz, I must say as I move into my fifth decade that I have a new criterion: Vengerov. Give this one an accessible spot on the shelf because you'll reach for it again and again.other reasons. But these are minor quibbles that in no way detract from the CD.<br />As I look back at the criterion performance of my youth, the Heifetz, I must say as I move into my fifth decade that I have a new criterion: Vengerov.

1608,5,"Can Russell carry a tune? Sure. Is he a competant performer? His record sales prove that.  In the end, is he really just spectacularly mediocre? You bet.  Could it be magic? YES!!! For all of those Watson fans who want to have one CD to keep handy that contains his best work so far -- this is for you.  I would give it 10 and I'm sure any true Watson fan out there whatever country would rate this the same.  The title says it all, every song that Russell sings, we want to hear it again and just shout \\""Encore!\\"""
1609,5,"Morgan Heritage an eclectic type of reggae with a message in each song. Some about freedom, oppression,  education,  and status. A nice mellow piece of music."
1610,4,"I really wanted to give it 3 1/2 points, but since that's not possible I'll be generous and give it 4 stars, only because it's not nearly as bad as some would have you believe.<br />There's some good rock songs here.  There's some weak ones.  I think part of why this album never took off was that it sounded too much like run-of-the-mill rock n' roll, kinda samey.  I thought Bowie's idea to join a group was pretty cool at the time. <br />The songs that are great:<BR>\\""Crack City\\"" - a powerful anti-drug song from someone who's been there and back.<BR>\\""Amazing\\"" - a sweet song with a great melody.<BR>\\""Bus Stop\\"" \\""Pretty Thing\\"" and \\""Video Crime\\"" are great rockers.<BR>\\""Baby Can Dance\\"" has sexual swagger and may be the best song on the album although it could be considered sexist in places by some.<br />The songs that work:<BR>\\""Heaven's in Here\\"" \\""Prisoner of Love\\"" \\""I Can't Read\\"" and Lennon's \\""Working Class Hero\\""<br />The rest are pretty weak.<br />So it is a mixed bag, but the good songs are good enough to heat and the album is certainly a worthy addition to the collection of any Bowie fan."
1611,5,"Danny the Wildchild once again drives home his mix of drum & bass and turntablism. If you like drum & bass even in the remotest amount, this is by far THE BEST album to date to make you fall in love with junglism. Danny takes his mix from one continent/label to the next of some of the finest drum & bass in the world. His skills cannot be matched by many, and his live performance will slam the dancefloors round the world anyday. If you like Danny the Wildchild, also check out some of his other mixes and you will not be disappointed."
1612,5,Since I first played this CD I have listened to it with my children every night as they go to sleep.  This recording is truly a masterpiece!  Soothing to the heart and yet musically so beautiful.  The harmonies move my heart. Shaina and Richard have so masterfully but together some beautiful work.  You can &quot;hear&quot; the love they have to share with the world.
1613,4,"I've been a fan of Not By Choice for quite a few years now and remember back in the olden days, getting home and listening to those demo cds and loving them. Then going to the shows and wondering how a band can play so great live. Then meeting them, talking to them, and becoming friends with them. So when this album came out i was ready for some great stuff...and i got it. But this wasn't exactly what I expected. I did love it, they're a great band...but after listening to the demos for so long i get used to Mikes voice and the way they play the songs. I didn't like how the instrumental intro's were takin off of &quot;Now That You Are Leaving&quot; and &quot;The Way It Used To Be&quot;, but still...great songs.<BR>So I do highly recomend this album to people who like Simple Plan, New Found Glory and MxPx. But if you want to hear Not By Choice at their best, go see them live."
1614,5,"Few male R&B artists in recent years have had a voice as strong and soulful as Chicago native Dave Hollister, yet no one on his level has endured the kind of drama this former Blackstreet member continues to experience in trying to get to the top. Though each of his previous efforts have gone gold, Hollister has remained entirely unnoticed by an audience who'd flip if only they knew he existed; Things in the Game finds him on his third label in as many albums, and still looking for a way in. <br />For the uninitiated, Hollister's music is squarely mainstream R&B, but his vocal style is second to none: He brings the smooth delivery of a Donny Hathaway or the Gap Band's Charlie Wilson to the modern, pulsating beats of urban soul. There's an old school undercurrent to everything he does, though, a focus on honey-sweet melodies over street bravado. <br />Love calls like \\""Love Hate Relationship\\"" and \\""Tonite\\"" find the perfect meeting place between Luther Vandross and R. Kelly, and the uptempo tracks (\\""My Everything,\\"" \\""We Gonna Make It\\"") recall the best of new jack swing with their call-and-response choruses and simple grooves. Hollister's songs here are the strongest he's had; he digs deep on the pleading ballad \\""I'm Wrong\\"" and smokes the silky, Fender-enhanced funk of the title track -- further proof that the best kept secret in R&B keeps getting better."
1615,5,"by far magnums best album,full stop."
1616,4,"Yes, it's true. Don't let the spanish title fool you. Hocico is an excellent industrial/ebm band. I was a bit skeptical at first when I heard of Hocico, but after hearing a few of their older songs a couple of years ago on a radio show I was inspired to buy their newest album. I must say I'm glad I did. Hocico pounds out powerful electronic industrial music every bit as potent as any german act. The music is purely electronic, aggressive, and most tracks are of a high bpm nature with distortion in the lyrics. A few of the song titles on Signos De Aberracion are in spanish, but all of the songs with lyrics in them are in english. The club favorites here will most likely include Instincts Of Perversion, Untold Blasphemies, and Forgotten Tears. The only weak point is a couple of the instrumental tracks that lack the dramatic feel of the rest of the album. Despite that short-coming, if you like industrial/ebm bands like Evil's Toy, Wumpscut or Abscess...definitely buy this album. Keep up the good work, Hocico!"
1617,5,"It's about time that she gets the credit that she deserves she is very talented and I think that this album really showcases her talent. Her other albums didn't do very well but I think that this one could be the break that she has been looking for. Newly signed to Jive Records, home of Nick Carter, Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears, Jennifer has matured into the singer/songwriter that we have been waiting for. <br />I am glad that her single is doing fairly well and hope that her album does the same. This album blends new sounds with songs and sounds that have been heard before. When people say that the music of today lacks some sort of substence then they can just lieten to this album. Filled with heart and soul, it should propel her to where she deserves to be, sitting alongside the other J. Lo."
1618,5,One of the best rock albums of last year.  I borrowed it from someone and then had to get a copy for myself.  Rocks from begining to end!
1619,5,"This new DMB cd is not like Everyday. It's a lot better, you can find a lot of really good songs with a mixture of the old stile of DMB and new great sounds. The best songs are You Never Know, Grey Street and Grace is Gone. You will not find a bad song in this new Cd."
1620,5,"This CD was a godsend. We would swaddle our howling son in a receiving blanket, jump right to track 2 (wipers), and rock him in the rocking chair (we sometimes used a pacifier too). He would go from a screaming fit to calm sleep instantaneously. He doesn't need it anymore, but it really got us through the first two months."
1621,2,"Had it not been for the sound of feedback three quarters of the way into the album, it would have been a good Tai Chi background music/nature sounds cd.  I think the artists were trying to mimic the sound of blowing wind.  Could have done without the sand mix in with the wind, though.  It sounded like it was hitting the mic.  It disrupted the class with laughter from the students.  Oh well, moving on."
1622,5,First heard this sound track when I was 11 on the movie. For some reason I knew then that I really liked it. How was I too know that it was because Jim Steinman wrote it and most of Meatloafs songs who I really like! Great music. Track 6 is the best one.
1623,5,"&quot;Ten&quot; is obviously one of the most widely known and influencial albums of the grunge era (early nineties).  That aside, &quot;Ten&quot; is a lyrically intense and energetic album that doesn't fail to ensure a fullfilled listening experience.  Eddie Vedder delievers powerfull vocals over the top of the tremorring guitars of Stone Gossard and Mike McCreedy, and the bass of Jeff Ament.<br />Songs like &quot;Even Flow&quot;, &quot;Alive&quot;, &quot;Black&quot;, and &quot;Jeremy&quot; are historic rock staples, but only accounting for those four would be only a fragment of the rock.  Pearl Jam delivers a strong openning with &quot;Once&quot;, which introduces the mood for the rest of the album.  &quot;Even Flow&quot; and &quot;Why Go&quot; are fast-paced and hard-hitting.  Slowing down the moementum, &quot;Black&quot; focuses on pain dealing with love.  &quot;Jeremy&quot;, which is based on a true story, talks about a child who commits suicide in front of his class.  &quot;Oceans&quot; is soft and thoughtful.  The intensity of the album is boosted back up except in a darker with &quot;Porch&quot;, &quot;Garden&quot;, and &quot;Deep&quot;.  Finally, the album ends with Eddie Vedder spiritually talking to his passed-away father in &quot;Release&quot;.<br />This album is definitely a classic and a must for any grunge fan.  &quot;Ten&quot; was just the start of a string of Pearl Jam creativity of musical genius.  Newer albums are lyrically and instrumentally more complex, yet they have never achieved the stardom of &quot;Ten&quot;"
1624,1,"This is possibly my favorite album of all time, and I am ashamed I have to give it one star. Honestly, it doesn't sound that bad and I think Ozzy's vocals are clearer than I've ever heard them.  The decision, however, of removing your former bass and drum player from a recording for legal purposes is ridiculous. Ozzy or Sharon or whoever's in control has ruined the entire album and shamed the memory of Randy Rhoads as well as the band \\""Blizzard of Ozz\\"" who resurected Ozzy's career.  the new mix is too modern with Ozzy's current bassist and drummer and they just can't recreate the same sound.  Its makes the entire album different...  I also noticed they chose to omit the rare live song \\""You Said it All\\"" probably because they couldn't get Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake out of the live tapes...  Even the rare \\""You Looking at me Looking at you\\"" has been ruined.  If you haven't bought this album yet, don't do it.  Go back and buy some of the new Black Sabbath releases coming out (that ozzy has no control over) and wait for this album to hopefully be discontinued and the real band restored..."
1625,4,"Perhaps its because my MP3 of the songs in the musical have the background sounds and conversations in it that I find the pure musicality of this CD to be a little empty.<br />For example, in Sweet's song, Sweet says, after Dawn announces her sister is the Slayer, for his minions  to &quot;find her. Tell her...tell her everything. Just get her here.&quot; In my MP3 version I have that conversation but the soundtrack leaves it out.<br />Also, because conversations and background noise drowned out some of the music in the episode I find myself constantly being surprised with an extra few notes in the beginning or end of a song.<br />It was nice to hear the entire Parking Ticket song and I am very happy they didn't combine Dawn's ballet with What you Feel like it was in the show.<br />Its a great soundtrack and I really only have one gripe with it. If Joss included a suite from Resltess why couldn't he have included the song Giles sang in the nightmare with the First Slayer. &quot;I've got to warn Buffy, there's every chance she could be next...&quot; I personally love that song and wish it had been included."
1626,5,Pete Wolf at his best . Baring heart and soul he touches on the search  for meaning of many of life's questions with <BR>a level of honesty rarly encounted. The music is terrific .I can tell .I've played the whole album over and over and so has my 17 year old daughter.
1627,4,"I saw the Scorpions perform \\""We'll Burn the Sky\\"" live on their last tour and I was totally blown away.  This CD is worth getting just for this song.  It stands up against the recognized classics of the 80's.  The rest of the album is an acquired taste.  Ulrich Roth was great on this album but seemed to be playing a different style than the rest of the band."
1628,5,"If, like myself, you've sometimes found the Cash catalog a little on the, um, monotonous side, then you might wanna check out this little disc.  It's one of his most atypical albums, Johnny doing covers of country standards that were originally recorded by other artists -- folks like George Jones, Hank Williams, Ferlin Husky and Ray Price -- and the arrangements are much different than his usual minimalist approach.  Pedal steel and fiddles seep into his sound, instruments that Cash had generally shied away from, and it sounds pretty darn good.  Honestly, he doesn't sound much more uncomfortable with this backup than with any of his other studio efforts around this time, and if he'd cut loose a little bit more, these tracks would be even more fun than they are to begin with.  Regardless, this is one of my favorite Johnny Cash albums -- I like the material, and I like his spin on it.  One silly note: Cash (or, more likely, his producers) altered the lyrics to &quot;Cocaine Blues&quot; into &quot;Transfusion Blues,&quot; which not only doesn't make much sense, it also sounds a lot more dangerous.  Anyway, I think this is a goodie &amp; recommend it wholeheartedly."
1629,5,"Her ecclectic sound defies categorization. It is a real treat to hear how Eva, even in her earliest recordings, applied her own sound to yet another musical genre. This is a definite departure from the type of music her fans might be used to. For one thing these are all original songs (written by her friend David Christopher) instead of covers. It is also different because these are fully finished recordings.  It's a nice opportunity to hear more of her beautiful background vocals. Although the style of these songs is somewhat different from other releases, she brings her own bluesy style and haunting melancholy harmonies, that are now recognizeable as distinctly Eva to these songs. This is a must have for true Eva Cassidy fans who want to learn all facets of this complex artist."
1630,3,"After hearing &quot;A Box Full of Sharp Objects&quot;, I expected the other songs to be more similiar, however they ended up sounding like a cross between Blink-182 and Hoobstank, which isn't a good thing for me. Don't get me wrong, The Used is better than both of those bands, but they just have that same tired sound that's so common among &quot;Rock&quot; music these days. That's not to say all the songs are bad, it's just that most of them sound so boring and cliche'. <br />However, there are definently a few exceptions such as &quot;Buried Myself Alive&quot; and &quot;A Box Full of Sharp Objects&quot; and a few others, but really, it just wasn't enough.<br />I honesntly wanted to give the cd 4 stars, but just couldn't bring myself to do it, even though I did enjoy some of the songs *immensely*. <br />Unfortunately, this is yet another MTV friendly band that I definently had high hopes for. I suggest you only buy this cd if you like bands such as Hoobastank. If not, then download the best songs and that will be that."
1631,5,well.. the single is as best as you can imagin... cool beats and cool sound of JLO..keepin' on rushin' JLO is the best!
1632,3,I like this album basically for the 'View From A Window' track. It is a tranquil progressive piece that is reminiscent of Tangerine Dream 'Cloudburst Flight' from Force Majeure. The acoustic guitar and synthesizer weave a very relaxing vibe. The title track 'Transfer Station Blue' has a disco feel to it like some late-70s Santana tunes. 'Nucleotide' is a drum-based track that would likely please any Michael Schrieve fan.
1633,5,"There are many different titles and subtitles for this disk, yet none of them point to the fact that this compilation was put together by Dj Spooky (aka Paul D. Miller). For those who do not know, Dj Spooky is probably the most well-read Dj/producer in history.<br />This collection of &quot;illbient&quot; is for a more intellectual and experimental breed than adherents to mere hip-hop/trip-hop circles.<br />Nonetheless, the beats found herein have a bass-boomin' groove that anyone with subwoofers can appreciate.<br />The last track is a bit of madness from spooky himself that will definately twist your brain with its chaotic structure and sample from...yes, that's right...Mr. Rogers!"
1634,5,"THIS SIDE  includes traditional, rockygrass AND blues selections. . .<BR>chris thile's  &quot;smoothie song&quot; is punchy to start the cd off. (he is such a MONSTER).   siblings, sean and sara watkin's textured harmonies make listening to this a surreal experience.  i think i like this one even more than the debut album<BR>(which i also loved) <BR>jill offidani :8&gt;~"
1635,5,"The Autopilot Off EP is awesome. Every song is catchy and makes you want to rock out! While it is very melodic it is also super catchy and superfast, a perfect combination. It has unbelieveable amounts of energy which at the least will make you tap your feet!"
1636,5,"This single is another gem from Robbins entertainment, the people who brought DJ Sammy's &quot;Heaven&quot; to this side of the Atlantic.  With smooth vocals and superb remixes from Hex Hector and Rhythm Edge, this track is impossible for dance music fans not to like."
1637,4,"1.PTS.OF.ATHRTY:Amazing,Jay Gordon did a very great job.The ending is very powerful. 4.5/5<BR>2.BUY MYSELF REMIX:Marilyn Manson remix.Dark and a littie chilling,the best one in the single! 5/5<BR>3.H!VLTG3:Hip-hop song.Mike's rap is very stunning,but the sound of piano is a little bit annoying. 3.5/5<br />Total: 4.5/5<br />If you're a LP fan,you must have this one!!"
1638,5,"I prefer this cd than the last one. This cd is for get relax &amp; enjoy the pop music with her special voice, all the songs are very good and with a nice style...<br />Thanks Jennifer."
1639,4,"Barenaked Ladies big-time &quot;sort-of&quot; debut album hit it big time with the songs &quot;One Week&quot; and &quot;It's all been done&quot; One Week has wild lyrics and a cool beat. It's all been done is good, but it does get old, one of the only songs on the cd that does so. I also like 'Alcohol', 'In the car' and 'When you dream' Barenaked Ladies also makes really cool videos. This cd is great, but if you want premium Barenaked Ladies, buy the CD 'Gordon'. I don't own it but I have heard it. It is excellent. Barenaked Ladies is a good, yet different, alternative band that has fulfilled it's potential."
1640,5,"My collection has had a big empty space in it insofar as Jelly Roll goes.  I was determined to fill it today but puzzled over which of the numerous discographies to purchase.  Than I saw the JSP box on the shelf.  From my JSP Django box, I new this collection, if nothing else, would have great sound quality.  It certainly does.  But it also contains wonderful material from the jazz cradle.  With all the hype Louis gets, and justly deserves, this box is quite examplary of why Jelly Roll should be truly appreciated for what he also contributed to the early framework of the music."
1641,2,This is not Willie singing with E.Rabbit
1642,4,"Some people love it it, some people hate it.  Gee, sounds like the old days.  If you liked &quot;Open up and say, ah&quot; through &quot;Flesh and Blood&quot; you will probably like &quot;Hollyweird&quot;.  This is classic Poison, either you love um, or hate um.  I love um, loud as always, crazy lerics, tipical CC guitar work.  CC's songs are ok, but just don't seem to be quite Poison, but oh well.  Anyway this album is not written for to get new fans, it written for us old fans who are looking for new old 80's music, and Poison delivers just what we wanted and have been craving since Nirvana took us out in 92.  The fact that some people hate it, others love it means that Poison is back in top form.  All we need now is some raunchy videos."
1643,3,"I bought this CD mainly on the strength of one song I heard from it, the moody and elegant &quot;One More for the Road&quot;, which Mr. Williams does to a T.  <BR>Listening to the rest of the album, however, I was expecting him to bring something of his own to the old swing songs popularized by the likes of Sinatra and Bobby Darin.  &quot;Mac the Knife&quot; and &quot;The Sea&quot; are two songs that Bobby Darin took for his own with very individualistic style and phrasing.  To my disappointment, though I have always liked the Darin versions (I am old enough that those were from my era.), Mr. Williams sang them exactly the same: the same phrasing, the same little jokes thrown in (Does he have any idea who Lotte Lenya was?), even the same &quot;Look out, old Mackie's back!&quot;.  He ought to have read/heard the originals, not just the recordings by the great song stylists of another era. Paying tribute to a singer one admires is one thing, copying his exact way of singing--no matter how well one does it--is quite another. <BR>I WILL listen to this album.  Mr. Williams does sing well, and the phrases he imitates were good the first time, and rhey are still good.  But the imitative quality of the music takes the edge off the pleasure."
1644,5,"I had never heard the Softies before but I already owned Go Sailor, which Rose Melberg is part of. That instantly made the album appealing and on a whim I chose &quot;It's Love&quot; as my first Softies purchase. I was not disappointed. Every song is absolutely beautiful. Rose Melberg and Jen Sbragia's voices are euphoric, whether alone or together. The music is simple; at most two guitars, whispy and twirled around the sweetest melodies. Although the entire album is perfect, personal favorites are: &quot;An Aweful Mess&quot;, &quot;Charms Around Your Wrist&quot;, &quot;Hello Rain&quot;, &quot;I Love You More&quot;, &quot;Alaska&quot;, &quot;This House&quot; (an instrumental), &quot;Perfect Afternoon&quot;, and &quot;Until You Tell&quot;. <br />It's Love..."
1645,5,"If youre lokking for latin jazz, there you have TOLU. The best of Alexs hands and feet."
1646,5,"While many reviewers and fans neglect the albums between &quot;461 Ocean Boulevard&quot; and &quot;Slowhand,&quot; 1975's &quot;There's One in Every Crowd&quot; and 1976's &quot;No Reason to Cry&quot; easily equal the quality of the former masterpieces.  No major radio singles, but plenty of mellow blues (and even a little gospel), funky riffs, moving ballads, and tasteful musicianship.  These two albums definitely do not belong in the bargain bins!"
1647,5,"Spencer Bates is on his way to filling a developing void in pop music.  In a time when Billboard is filled with the likes of Britney Spears, N*Sync, and the like, it's refreshing to find somebody who actually plays and writes their own music; somebody whose lyrics the listener can actually identify with.  I highly recommend picking up this CD."
1648,5,"This CD is amazing! The singer has an incredibly unique and hauting voice, and a very mature songwriting style. The cello adds such a melancholy beauty that interacts perfectly with the vocals and acoustic guitar. I'd recommend this CD to anyone."
1649,5,"...records I have ever heard. I'd been a fan of these people for years before this record was released. Fantastic musicians, some of the finest in the world. Please check out &quot;Hapless Child&quot; by Mantler.<br />John Reed from Beijing wrote how amusing and entertaining it is, and I couldn't agree more. A truly great record."
1650,1,"I never received the CD, so I can't tell you how I liked it or if I liked it.  Your tracking system is not much use."
1651,5,"In Flames are one of those bands that make you want to go out and buy every single album by them as soon as you hear what they sound like. When I first heard \\""The Jester's Dance,\\"" I knew that it was my destiny to own every In Flames CD in existance. While not epic in the sense of Opeth or Neurosis, these guys clearly know how to create great metal songs with awesome guitar melodies. Although death metal and indie rock are two very different genres, I can see many similarities between this album and Diary by Sunny Day Real Estate. Both are the debuts of outstanding groups, the CD's that won over the original fanbase. While both bands went on to make albums just as good as (if not better than) their first CD, the fans still remember the debut as a great listen. I suggest that you pick this up very soon if you want to listen to some great metal. Who knows? You might just find a new favorite band."
1652,4,"If you're trying to build up your Tori collection, this is a good item to buy if you don't already have it. Or if you want to get into Tori, buying this would also be good. That being said, my favorite track on here is the cover of \\""Thank You.\\"" I love Led Zeppelin, but she did this song very nicely, and her voice is prettier than Robert Plant's, anyway. The cover of \\""Angie\\"" is nice, but I don't think it's anything special. The \\""Crucify\\"" remix and \\""Winter\\"" are good because they give you a glimpse of what Little Earthquakes are like. As for \\""Smells Like Teen Spirit,\\"" I have to say I disliked this cover. When I first heard it, it sounded like cats dying. Maybe I'm just crazy because everyone else loved it.<br />Besides, you can't redo Nirvana."
1653,5,"The problem with most New-Age music is its lack of sophistication.  In general, you have second-rate musicians and composers who record their music in home studios, then try to sell it.   Not the case here... these two artists are accomplished with movie soundtracks and other similar credits.  The CD is well produced.   The music is full, vibrant and sounds great on the best stereo equipment.  <BR>The music has many influences.... arabic, african mix with indian and a little american pop.   The composition is excellent.   Catchy tunes make this CD a favorite.   There's not one track that I don't like. It's nice to relax with and listen to at home, but still has enough energy in it so you can listen in the car without being put to sleep.<BR>PS.  The best for last.... this CD and a little candlelight will put him or her in the mood.  Try it!"
1654,4,Good album. If you plan on getting the dvd be aware it's  recorded in 2.0 and it sounds weak - VERY weak.
1655,5,"I bought this album because every critic that I respect loved it.  I bought it and was blown away by how awful it sounded.  The music sounded all messed up and the vocals were really bad.  I thought I would give it a couple more spins, but not till I had recovered from the first experience.  About a month later I played it again....wow it was amazing.  Everything appeared to make sense after the second time around and I really enjoyed it.  It is one of those things that simply isn't for everybody.  If you like it than consider yourself a special being, if you hate it then don't worry about it, probably 99.9% of other people do. I am just surprised that the album gets a 4.5 star rating.  I figured it would get either 5 since no one really knows or cares about it, or 3-3.5 because some people would check it out and automatically give it 1 star.  Oh an just so you know, this whole album is like one big mistake.  Beefheart wrote all the songs on piano, which he couldn't play, and he wrote all 28 songs in 9 hours.  They spent not only a year practicing the music, but a good portion of that year transcribing the music from Beefheart's crazy piano parts to guitar, drum, and bass.  It took forever because he wrote parts of the music in different meters and time signatures.  People who don't think that the people playing the music had talent are truly not intelligent.  They had to practice it for a year because it was some of the hardest music ever to play in rock history.  It is like every person playing their part is doing something entirely different than the next.  Oh and to top it off when Beefheart recorded his vocal tracks, he didn't wear his headphones, so he never sings along with the music, which I guess really didn't matter since the music was so screwed up anyway.  Oh well, some genius will never be fully appreciated.  Beefheart is by far the weirdest guy ever to make music and I think he always will be."
1656,5,"I Have been obsessed with the music of Phish for more than a year now and consider them to be one of the best bands (if not the best) of their time. When I heard Trey was coming out with a solo album I was ecstatic since the band hasn't released any new material since Farmhouse.  When I got the record and put it in the stereo I was blown away. It had the avante garde edge of Phish with stronger songs and much more dynamic sound. It it was a thrill to hear the powerful horns, funky rhythms, and terrific guitar playing. Push on Til Day exhibits Trey's exceptional talent on guitar with an amazing solo that mixes the jazziness of Phish's earlier effort with a strong, bluesy feel.  Caymen Review, Alive Again, and Ether Sunday show considerable reggae influence and are highlights of the album.  So what if it isn't Phish.  It retains all the great qualities of Phish and simply expands on them. Its not Junta or Picture of Nectar, however, it is a must have for any Phish fan. Trey truly shows that he can hold his own without Phish; this cd is more than enough proof."
1657,5,"I love this cd, the music and lyrics are soothing. I would recommend this cd to anyone. Even if you do not understand German, it will make you all that willing to learn."
1658,4,"I purchased this CD just after a trip to Sri Lanka, where I saw the film in a camel drive-in theatre with cous-cous beverages and olive-leather blanket seats. It was one of the greatest decisions I have made since moving all my underclothes into a tiny red wastepaper basket. I listen to it now while I wax my car with 'I Can't Believe It's Not Car Wax'. Do not ask me for details - simply allow me to say that this CD will change your soul for eternity. Dr. Brown is quite the delectable dish, no? Hhee hhee hhee."
1659,5,"Quite simply a brilliant work, Peter Murphy's rich, deep baritone in harmony with titillating Turkish and Indian sounds leaves one very satisfied. To have evolved through the years from doing &quot;goth rock&quot; into this magical incarnation is an accomplishment. Peter's voice becomes a &quot;magickal&quot; tool used in conjunction with carefully crafted songs and delightfully haunting lyrics to take you into other dimensions. I can only imagine that his new record company is thrilled to have him and he seems to finally be reaching his stride after years of mundane hassles that - while not diminishing the quality of his work - seemed to somehow distract.<br />That music can be both entertaining and enriching is exemplified through the amazing work of Peter Murphy. He gently tears away the limitations over what supposedly works in pop music, and what doesn't. Those who would never touch &quot;pop&quot; and those who would never think of listening to Turkish sounds are smoothly united in the celebration of the mysterious - which is Peter Murphy. He creates rhythmic ecstasy and mystic bliss that are all of a sudden so accessible and enduring. The songs stay with you and become cognitive, spiritual jewels to treasure. Therein is his true gift to the world.<br />On the stage, Peter Murphy is at the caliber of David Bowie, Bryan Ferry, and Richard Butler - with a presence that is all his own and transcends anything I have ever experienced. The energy is palpable and you feel your nervous system stimulated in profound ways. He commands attention and you leave transformed.<br />Peter Murphy, you are awesome."
1660,5,"I bought this in '97 and still listen to it all the time, along w/their first cd.  What a great second cd."
1661,5,"HIGHWAY should have been the follow-up album, after FIRE AND WATER, to make FREE the superstars they were destined to be. The recording sessions that produced HIGHWAY were among the easiest and most confident of Free's recording career. HIGHWAY, released in December of 1970, reached only #41 in the UK and #190 in America (compared to #2 and #17, respectively, for FIRE AND WATER). Although FREE were at the height of their fame having had an international smash hit with ALL RIGHT NOW. Highway's Recording Engineer, Andy Johns, said he knew the album was doomed as soon as he saw the pallid record sleeve with no conspicuous display of Free's name. It was further reported that reviewers and disc jockeys were saying things like \\""... good band this Highway, they sound amazingly like Free\\"".<br />There's a pair of strutting sexy songs, RIDE ON A PONY and THE STEALER, which competed for the role of follow-up to ALL RIGHT NOW. THE STEALER, sporting lyrics \\""I'm the stealer, come to steal your love\\"", failed to even enter the UK Top 75 and a few weeks later it stalled at #49 in America.<br />There were three weighty love songs, LOVE YOU SO, SOON I WILL BE GONE, and BE MY FRIEND, that captured Free's established approach to romance as serious business. BE MY FRIEND was actually described by Paul Kossoff as \\""the best thing we've ever done\\"", a statement that this writer agrees with. The song is absolutely wonderful.<br />There were three mellow, more typical Free, songs in ON MY WAY, SUNNY DAY, and BODIE.<br />The opening track, THE HIGHWAY SONG, is a piano-and-drums-led shuffle with an improbably agrarian storyline evident to the lighter tread and sinuous polyrhythms of The Band's Music From Big Pink influences on Rodgers and Kossoff.<br />History emerges with no account of the startling commercial failure of Free's HIGHWAY album. The music it contains should have made them superstars. Instead, Free began their descent down the road of destruction and ruin that would break up the band and ultimately lead to the drug induced death of one of Rock's greatest guitarists, Paul Kossoff.<br />Only now, we have posterity and here we are.<br />The additional tracks, MY BROTHER JAKE and ONLY MY SOUL, are welcome additions to the HIGHWAY line-up, as are the BBC performances of RIDE ON A PONY and BE MY FRIEND. MY BROTHER JAKE was a mono single released in April 1971 which made #4 in the UK charts. Additional track 14, RAIN, is another take on the song which first appeared on the box set SONGS OF YESTERDAY and is previously unreleased, until now. Remastering was performed at Abbey Road by Peter Mew, and is excellent!  <br />RECOMMENDATION:<BR>5 STARS ALL THE WAY!<BR>The time has come to appreciate HIGHWAY the way it should have been appreciated in 1971."
1662,5,this girl gotz talent she sings so beautiful. I just love &quot;nothing in this world&quot; that her best song. well &quot;Cant wait&quot; the second best and OMG this girl wow the way she sang the remake of Patti Labelle's &quot;if only you knew&quot; she really made it sound beautiful when me and my sister listend to it on our way home from buying it we were so shocked that she almost sounded just like Patti wow especially when she hit the high note me and my sister gave her props. I hope the best for her in the future shes really talented!! can't wait for her to make another CD.LOL
1663,5,Extreme unabashed soul.  I wish I could find the song &quot;Ready- Made Family&quot; by Linda Jones (at least I'm pretty sure it's her).<br />Tina Marie (a favorite of mine) covered Linda's work and sings very much like her.  The big cities played this ladies music from the highest projects.  House parties and family gatherings.  I wish I could have more access to her works and that the Old School radio stations would play more of than just &quot;Hypnotized&quot;.<br />Linda Jones' soul-stirring depth of expression and powerful voice are like an Italian opera; overwhelming dramatic intensity.
1664,5,"While Topsy Turvey isn't as experimental as their EP, the production is great and it's much easier to get into.  Sounding like a cross between melodic System of a Down and a mix of world music, songs like Add Mission and Apposibly are infectious, but not simple enough to get bored with in no time at all.<br />I'm still amazed the single Shh...Hope Diggy has gotten any attention on the radio, it's leauges ahead of anything else of the radio just in terms of originality, and to see it achieve success has (slightly) restored my faith that good music can still survive in a world of Sum 41s and Nickelbacks.  If you like this you have to check out Faith No More (shame on you if you haven't heard them yet) Mindless Self Indulgence and of course System of a Down"
1665,5,"Rock N Roll Animal carries such great memories from college, when it was always the record of choice at those small to medium-sized parties in the \\""living room\\"" at the top of the spiral staircase of the dorm in which I was the RA during my senior year.  Everyone couldn't wait for the opening to \\""Sweet Jane.\\""  I did not know who The Velvet Underground were at the time, but learned from this album.<br />\\""White Light/White Heat\\"" is a good live cut, with great guitar soloing, and \\""Lady Day,\\"" with its banging rhythms, is an excellent inclusion, fitting in well with the electronically intense atmosphere.  But to me, Rock N Roll Animal will always be mainly three things:<br />1) The dynamic, double guitar electronic entry into \\""Sweet Jane\\"" by Steve Hunter and Dick Wagner and then the swaggering remainder, making you temporarily forget heavenly wine and roses.<br />2) Those rushes of ecstasy in the absorbing \\""Heroin,\\"" climaxed by the awesome finale, with the most dazzling, blistering, electrifying pieces of raw lead and rhythm guitar power I have ever heard.  The organ provides texture in the slower parts, and speeds up, in the faster ones, and oh boy, in that final rush....  If there is a better live version, someone please tell me.<br />3)  Hearing such a tremendous performance of the Velvet's best song ever, \\""Rock & Roll.\\""  In comparing it to the not-quite-so-intense studio version, I guess I look at the glass half full not half empty.  Is that second part in \\""Behind Blue Eyes\\"" by The Who understated in the studio, or a concert opportunity?  I like the studio \\""Rock & Roll\\"" a lot, but this live version is something else, with an authentic rhythm guitar solo, fret-crushing and funky, along with the usual awesome lead, and this song is most about driving rhythmic pleasure, as much as you'll ever experience.<br />In the many displays of super-speeded guitar power, we are taken beyond explosion, to screeching, literally white light and white heat.  There is nothing like it.This is one of my top ten albums of all time.  It is the supreme display of Lou Reed's live talents.  A must."
1666,5,"I bought this cd the day it came out and I'm glad I did. It is one of her best albums yet. Anyone who loves Celine will love this, too.  There isn't any song on here that you couldn't listen to over and over again."
1667,5,"This is my first exposure to the Tony Rice Unit, though I had listened to David Grisman's Hot Dawg (with T.R. on guitar) some years back. I can't say enough good here- somewhat out of the deep bluegrass genre perhaps, this CD blends guitar, fiddle, mandolin and bass together in smooth, haunting melody and foot-stomping frolic in the most seamless manner imaginable. You will not be disappointed."
1668,1,"This Limp Bizkit stuff is enough to drive any person with a normal head crazy. How can anybody listen to this! I borrowed this cd from a friend because he claimed this music speaks to you. Whatever that means? Do not buy this you will seriously regret it! I call it depressing, suicidal, and very crazy. American Teenagers do not need music like this. Music like this causes lots of problems."
1669,5,"Elva, by Unwritten Law is the best cd to buy if you want to experience hard-core pop and punk all in one. Their hit single &quot;Seein Red&quot; is by far one of the best new songs on the charts today. Buy this cd and you will be amazed at how much little money you spend for such a great cd. Pop fan or punk you will be satisfied with this cd."
1670,5,"There is really no word to describe this cd's excellence, so I chose fantabulous, as in fanstastic and fabulous. I admit I had only known Nada Surf from \\""popular\\"" and didn't really like it, but recently my friend had played this cd and I can't get enough of it. If you are even wasting your time reading this review, you obviously have some interest in Nada Surf, so I say to you sir: stop wasting your time and get out your wallet. The only problem is finding the damn album at stores, NO ONE here in colorado seems to have it. Thank god for amazon."
1671,5,"I really like Opeth, they always manage to surprise me with not only some really creative texture and guitar interplay, but also with their ability to keep crafting songs that while as out there as they can get, still keep my interest and still prove that this awesome band can progress, even though they are always at the top of their game. This is my favorite CD of theirs just because it is such a collection of all the things that makes Opeth such an awesome band, from the brutal to the somber, the simplistic (which they actually have) to the all-out technical, and the demonic to the angellic."
1672,5,"Serving as Crowded House's last official studio album, _Together Alone_ packs quite an eclectic punch.  For fans of songs like \\""Fall at Your Feet\\"" and \\""Don't Dream It's Over\\"", the album contains slower songs such as \\""Nails in My Feet\\"" (one of Finn's best out of many, many deeply romantic, intimate songs), \\""Fingers of Love\\"", and \\""Catherine Wheels.\\""  However, Crowded House locks into full agressive adult rock mode on tracks like \\""In My Command\\"", \\""Locked Out\\"", \\""Black and White Boy\\"", and \\""Skin Feeling.\\""<br />If one of your favorite qualities of Crowded House is Finn's voice, this might be the best Crowded House album to pick up.  His voice literally soars on all the tracks.  The production is also quite inventive and dense - you'll be picking up new little things left and right with repeated listenings.<br />When I think of Crowded House, I think of them as one of the few bands that actually justifies the relative expensive price of CDs - these are albums that contain songs that will remain with you forever and you will never grow tired of.  They made albums that stay in your CD player for months at a time.  They made albums that hit you on the first listen and only get better with time.  They made albums that should've gotten more attention than they did.  Oh well...our little secret treasures are the general public's loss."
1673,2,"i'm dreaming. i remember fondly when i was in high school and would save up all my money to buy records that sounded new and exciting and most of all ALIVE and most of these groups were guitar groups from britain that had taken the parts of american bands that they liked the best like dinosaur jr and sonic youth and flaming lips and pixies and of course velvet underground and then turned it inward and dreamy and druggy all at the same time and that begat bands like boo radleys, ride, my bloody valentine and swervedriver just to name a few, and some people used to call this type of rock n roll DREAM POP or SHOEGAZE (but you and i know that it's really all rock n roll right?) well this stratford 4 group (no confusey with spacemen 3 please!) is trying so hard to do this dream pop thing they forgot to write songs but they put in all the noisey guitars and tremelo and delay and boy they know how to work those pedals!"
1674,5,"This is the best material either of these guys has done in years.  If you like either of them, you'll love this album.  If you like Clapton-esque blues with B.B. King riffs and overtures, you won't be able to stop listening.  If you love King's music and his legacy and want to hear it updated and enlivened a bit by Clapton, you've found your album.  Definitely a must-have for the serious blues fan."
1675,5,"I've been a major Pumpkins fan for 8 years now, and I just have to say that this is one of the best collections of &quot;B&quot; sides out there.  It really embodies their style, from Gish to MCIS.  The 6th track, &quot;Set the Ray to Jerry&quot; is one of my absolute favorite Pumpkins songs, and &quot;Cherry&quot; is another one.  If you like the Pumpkins, this is a must for your collection. =)"
1676,4,"HALF A BOY HALF A MAN by GEORGE THOROGOOD AND THE DESTROYERS is a no nonsense slab of rock and roll the way it should be. There are no gimmicks or flashiness, GT lets his guitar do all the talking for him. This album totally rocks and will be enjoyed by all music fans. I think out of the 11 songs on the album, the only one that doesnt cut the mustard to me is AS LONG AS I HAVE YOU. It is a good song, I just think the the vocal quality isnt up to par. If you need to know which songs are the best, I DONT TRUST NOBODY, 99 DAYS IN JAIL, JUST PASSIN THRU, DOUBLE SHOT and the title track are enough reasons why to purchase this album. I highly recommend this song for the serious music fan."
1677,4,"the first time I saw Pink was that video she did with Christinia, Lil' Kim, and Maya. Then I watch an espiode of MTV's Diary, with her as the subject. She got my interest. Once I saw her again on MTV's Making the Video, I was hooked. I love &quot;Get <BR>This Party Started&quot;, so much so that I bought her CD, Missundaztood not long after that. I love almost every song, espically the bluesy duet that she does with Steve Tyler, &quot;Misery&quot;. With this new CD, Pink proves to be an artist of considerable talent. I can't wait for her next one."
1678,2,"One year after the release of his first solo cd, GIRLS WITH GUNS, Tommy's second cd, WHAT IF, was released.  What if, the title track, was the lead off single, for the cd, and the soundtrack, REMO WILLIAMS THE ADVENTURE BEGINS.  The single is not the best song on this cd, it has a good guitar line thru it, but the song sags in the middle, and never recovers from it.  By using this has the first single to lead off the cd, and it being a weak song, this in turned hurt the cd.<BR>    See Me Now, Nature of the Beast, Reach for the Bottle, all try hard to show a more mature side of Tommy's writing, but just never reach that point.<BR>   Jealousy starts the disk off strong, and delivers the promise of a good disk, but rest of the songs, for the most part, fail to deliver.  True Confessions, Freindly Advice, and This is not a Test, are also good songs, with the latter being a very potent cold war song. Bad Times is a nice change of pace, a lighter feel to his music.<BR>     For the most part this cd fails because of the production.  The first cd GIRLS, had good songs, but was greatly over produced.  This cd has some good songs, but again, the production kills the the cd.  This time the production is very lacking.   It would not be untill his third cd, AMBITION (5 STARS), that Tommy would take off."
1679,5,"The Lawrence Arms have two other full-length records, but I hadn't heard of them until I learned they were putting their newest out on Fat.  Apathy and Exhaustion is a fantastic blast of empassioned fast and melodic punk rock.  Themes of disillusion, exhaustion, indifference and feeling burnt out run throughout the album, and the band's two singers (gravelly uber-punky 'Clarence Darrow' and softer 'Lehigh Acres') share vocal duties; Darrow sings the knock down, drag out songs, while Acres takes the slower and more mapped out tunes.  It works really well and the approach is similar to the one Propagandhi used on their first two albums.  No matter who's singing, the fuzzed out guitars wail, the bass pops along merrily, and the great (cynical, funny, embittered) lyrics all swirl together for a truly staggering brew.  Highly recommended!  The Arms are one of my new favorite bands."
1680,5,I've seen him live twice now.  This set has to be by far his best.  Saw him here locally and at All-Stars during Mardi Gras.  He hits so many good tracks on one cd.  His own song &quot;Fall into Me&quot; is one of the best he's ever done.  &quot;Ghosts&quot; by Tenth Planet melts you down to absolutely nothing.  Crowd noise is not a problem.  Moonshine at their best with this DJ.  Keep it up Micro.
1681,4,"This soundtrack wonderfully captures the feeling and spirit of this fabulous movie, and I can certainly recommend it highly. It is a little disappointing that several good tracks from the movie weren't included, but if you don't have the DVD you have to have this soundtrack. Ewan McG. is just wonderful..."
1682,2,"Okay, to start, Tori Amos has had some very good albums in the past. Earlier in the 90s, she had some very excellent female angst-type stuff, and I was able to appreciate that. This, on the other hand-<br />Okay, the album starts with a boring melody and last of gaspy non-singing in &quot;New Age.&quot; This seemed forever, so I skipped to the next one, a sad butchering of Eminem's &quot;97 Bonnie &amp; Clyde.&quot; Why this was picked was probably to show the fragile sanity of human nature, or to fit in with the misery of the rest of the album. Bad choice. It's just wrong for the album. <br />There is some assorted misery in between, &quot;Strange Little Girl&quot; isn't terrible, but it's nothing I'd recommend, either. We skip through a few more tracks of hate and anger before arriving to an updated &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; with the heavy hip-hop/hard rock infused backbeat. It's just pitiful. She screams through it, leaving you with a BAD headache and wondering if this was any way Neil Young invisioned it sung when he wrote it.<BR> <BR>I admit I couldn't even finish this. It just drags on and on and you can't really grasp it. She seems to just recycle other songs by other artists and while she offers a lot of individualism to the tracks, she doesn't offer a good sense of it. The album goes from screaming to whispering and in the end, just ends up getting on your nerves."
1683,2,"You may look at the rating and get the wrong impression -- that I dislike the music in Moulin Rouge. That's not true, the music is great. However, the songs are meant to go with the movie -- without visuals, they're empty. Go pick up the DVD for a better experience"
1684,5,"I wouild call this cd being kirk franklins most recent cd a <BR>semi spin off the nu nation project. you must definitely listen to all the songs on this cd from it is \\""time to move on\\"" to \\""in your grace\\"" this is a must have in the library of gospel greats <BR>such as indisputably Fred Hammond and Detrick Haddon.<BR>   I myself would call him the music revlutionary of this millenium."
1685,5,"Anyone who was between 16 &amp; 25 in the late 80's early 90's should have this in there collection.<br />A great Scottish band, a brilliant Album. I have bought this CD several times as I keep leaving it places when I travel.<br />Nothing short of magical !"
1686,2,"when i bought this cd, i expected it to be just like any other phish cd. i was dead wrong. the only good use for this is to go to sleep to, cause i fell asleep around the third song it was so boring. dont make a foolish mistake and dont buy this cd."
1687,4,"the song is nice, but after a few times you listen to it it's boring."
1688,1,"I'm not a big Pink Floyd lover but liked them enough to be interested in a Best Of CD.  So I bought it without paying much attention to the track listing because we all know what SHOULD be included in a Pink Floyd Best Of, right?  Needless to say, I should have read the track list more carefully.  If you are like most people, you will be disappointed.  How can you have a Pink Floyd Best Of without Dark Side of the Moon?  Are we to believe the weak 80's and 90's tracks on here are really better than some of their classics?  I feel... off."
1689,5,"Fresh off the death of original lead singer Bon Scott the Austrailian hard rockers put out what is widely considered their greatest album. Back in Black is an awesome album with killer tracks like hells bells, You shook me All night long and the title track especially is their (and therefor the world's) greatest song. The album has the raw sex, drugs, and rock n roll attitude of ACDC's golden age in the late '70's with an cd full of sweet rock. brian Johnson dosent have to be able to sing, anyone who could go out there and sceam their balls off would do it but he fits the style of AC/DC well. Killer disk"
1690,4,"I was introduced to MC Breed via Too $hort's \\""Cocktales\\"" album.  It wasn't a surprise that the styles were pretty similar.  While not as misogynist as Too's work (is that possible?) it's still not for kids.  Plenty of sexual lyrics, but in the way that art imitates life, sex is better than violence.  <BR>So this album isn't GREAT, but it's definitely not BAD.  The title says it all..."
1691,2,"In early 1995, Froese senior was still busy mangling Tangerine Dream's albums of the past, preparing them for the &quot;Tangents&quot; compilation, not to mention his involvement in a similar enterprise - mangling his own solo compositions of the past for the double album &quot;Beyond the Storm&quot;, which appeared for sale later in the year. Without much parental guidance, Froese junior sat down and with the father's permission used the musical input of Froese family to pursue his own visions. The result was the first entree in the multi-year dinner of &quot;Dream Mixes&quot;, a project continued to this day. Originally available in clubs, and then only as a single CD, this album was finally reissued by Froese's own label, TDI, a few years later - as a double CD. Jolly well! I wish they had the decency to issue their soundtrack collection, &quot;The Hollywood Years&quot;, on one double CD instead of adopting a heartless commercial attitude of releasing two separate CDs at the same time. Greed is a cardinal sin, last I heard.<br />The contents of this CD, as suggested in my reviews of immediately preceding work, is the set of mangled tunes, and then remangled again and again. Oh well, after all it's an album of Froese junior mixes, that much is clear. Very foine idear, methinks - but I wish they had perished the thought of playing with the same small set of tunes again and again! If you want to mix, mix! But at least choose a wider set of input tracks to mix, for otherwise it defeats its purpose. The albums mangled on &quot;Dream Mixes&quot; are &quot;Rockoon&quot;, &quot;Turn of the Tides&quot; and &quot;Tyranny of Beauty&quot;. <br />More often than not, the mixes are as unimaginative as the originals, but I must give Jerome one thing - he does seem to have a feeling for techno. Tracks like 'Virtually Fields', 'San Rocco', or the incredibly rocking 'Sojus' represent a solid, good work which should catch your interest even if you are as despirited with the direction as I am. The irony is that musically, 'Sojus' alone puts their studio albums from 1992 to 1994 to shame."
1692,4,"I grew up in Indiana and went to school in Ohio.  Before the internet, I relied on word of mouth and Rolling Stone for cd purchases.  I bought Urban Hymnes during my Junior year and it really blew my mind.  It is my favorite album of all time for me.  &quot;Loaded&quot; by Velvet Underground is second.  This band is easy to LOVE for the masses because it has the 'unknown, uncommercialised' appeal and because they are truly a great band. For some reason I waited to buy 'A Northern Soul', maybe out of fear that it would ruin my feelings toward the band.  The album is cool to listen to because I can feel there movement towards &quot;Urban Hymnes&quot;.  It is less layered and complex than &quot;urban hymnes&quot; and &quot;So it Goes&quot; is already a classic in my mind, along with &quot;Drive you Home.&quot;  I bought Richard solo effort and it was too calculated.  BUT, Richard Ashcroft truly is incredible, defiently the most under rated rock artist in the last ten years.  Maybe he is huge in the UK, but not in the states.  Buy this album if you want to listen to some great music.  Ryan Adams and The Strokes media machines and alcolades make me sick while &quot;The Verve&quot; goes unnoticed, but hey, isn't that how we like it?"
1693,5,"I've been a Sade fan since her debut.  She's a refreshing change from pop and hard rock.  This CD is a must-have for Sade fans and for jazz, blues and R&amp;B lovers.  My favorite songs are Smooth Operator, Cherish the Day, Nothing Can Come Between Us, Your Love is King...I love the whole CD!  But my favorite is No Ordinary Love.  That song has so much soul...it just takes me away. <br />Do yourself a favor, get this CD.  You won't regret it!"
1694,5,"Innovators should be on any musician's shelf.  True musical artistry in tribute to some of the greatest humans to grace the planet.  To get the true beauty of the music, read the blurb as you listen.  Prepare for an artistic experience."
1695,3,"When I bought this CD I wasn't expecting it to sound like the original because Les wasn't lead vocals, but if your a true roller fan you would want this for your collection."
1696,5,"This is an absolutely wonderful album, especially lyricwise. What's all the fuss about Staind getting their start from Fred Durst ? I knew of Staind back in the day when Fred was insulting them. And I find it quite hilarious when people say that Fred &quot;sang&quot; on Outside. All the guy does is say &quot;I'm feeling those lighters,&quot; and that's not even the version of Outside that's on the CD !<br />For those who think that this album is too &quot;poplike&quot;, the only thing I have to say is listen to Waste. Oh yeah... and as for their lyrics being too &quot;whiny&quot; ? What artist out there doesn't express sadness, etc. in lyrics ? Answer me that.<br />Anyway, you'd be extremely wise to buy this album-- it's awesome. My favorite tracks are Open Your Eyes, Fade, Epiphany, and Waste. Buy this CD. You'll be glad you did."
1697,5,"IF YOU DONT NORMALLY RELY ON ONLINE REVIEWS, RELY ON THIS ONE. I LOVE THIS BAND. IM 31, AND SO, SO SICK OF CRAP BANDS LIKE BLINK 182 AND OTHER MTV BANDS. THIS IS SO COOL. THEY WILL NEVER BE POPULAR.. WHY? BECAUSE THIS IS WELL THOUGHT OUT, MELODIC, AWESOME MUSIC! NO LIKES GOOD MUSIC! WELL THATS JUST FINE! WHAT A GREAT DISCOVERY. 5 STARS FOR EVERY DEATH CABBIE ALBUM. AND THANK YOU FOR PUTTING OUT SOMETHING THIS PHENOMENAL. SONG 5 ON THIS ALBUM IS UNREAL. MAN..."
1698,5,"this album is brilliant. lyrically and musically, this was the apex of the two meshing together. the hilarious lyrics of \\""frankly...\\"" and the aggressive strumming of \\""bigmouth...\\"" indicate a mature band at the peak of their ability. songs such as the beforementioned and \\""there is a light that never goes out,\\"" and \\""some girls are bigger than others\\"" are perfect pop songs for the ages. 15 years after their release they are just as relevant and beautiful as they were back in the day."
1699,1,Shaq and his family must have written the 5 star reviews for this cd because I would't wish this horrid piece of crap on my worst enemy
1700,2,"In the years before his suicide, Paul Clayton did some great work, especially in ferretting out obscure material and breathing life into it.  Unfortunately, this particular album lacks the vitality of his earlier work, and portrays some great songs with a sense of weariness that belies the roaring energy that these songs demand."
1701,5,"I own Sailor Moon And The Scouts: Lunarock and Sailor Moon: Songs From The Hit TV Series, and Sailor Moon: Sailor Stars Best<BR>is by far THE BEST the songs are so great and if you're in love with sailor moon as much as I am, you'll love this CD. It is worth every penny!"
1702,4,The album &quot;Marscape&quot; was recorded and released in 1976 and<BR>features performances by Brand X members Robin Lumley and <BR>guest drumming by Phil Collins. The music is smooth and<BR>flowing and gradually builds up to a crescendo of a sonic<BR>landscape. Robin Lumley is a versatile keyboard player and<BR>his lead lines on the Minimoog are outstanding as well as his<BR>playing on the Fender Rhodes electric piano. This album is<BR>representative of the best of 70's fusion and is highly recommended.
1703,5,"My first encounter with The Tea Party was 3 years ago, when I tried to plug on alive music. I am 41 and I am quite into music for a while. I discovered techno music and I consider this kind of music as the blessing of the god of music...now.  Then I was struck by Transmission who became my number one album of all times. After that Tangent took the relay. I have all there albums and I say Tangent is a must. Techno is the hope for alive music...OK.  The Tea Party and that furious  Interzone Mantras are totaly something else. Like Melkisedek, in the Bible, who is the only one without a genealogy. He comes from nowhere and disappear after his mission, The Tea Party are out of this world.  They are not alive music, they are LIFE ITSELF. <br />Since 1975 I was in search of the music out of this world. I discovered a lot of jewels. Then I became a cristal, secure in his own discoveries. I am proud the have kick my... <br />The point is that music is still alive and deploy. The Tea Party are going somewhere nobody went before, in the soul, in a very specific way... <br />They go in in the soul not to lament. They go in as furious warriors, not to kill, not to distroy, but to remind us all we are responsable of the life we were given IN THE INTERZONE...NOW."
1704,5,"This is the latest Nena single to date( released on 15 October 2001 ) and it is linked to the latest Nena album CHOKMAH( released on 29 October 2001 ).  It features two songs from that album:  &quot;Carpe Diem&quot;( &quot;Seize the Day&quot; ) and &quot;Lass die Leinen los&quot;( &quot;Let the Linen Loose&quot; ).  The version of &quot;Lass die Leinen los&quot; provided in this cd single is the radio version, while &quot;Carpe Diem&quot; has five versions featured here:  the radio version, the Soehne Mannheims ragga mix--radio edit, the Soehne Mannheims ragga mix, the album version, and the DTS surround version.  Depending on each individual's preference, the five versions of &quot;Carpe diem&quot; appeals to an extremely wide audience.  Therefore, I very highly recommend this latest Nena cd single to all who enjoy very good music in terms of very meaningful lyrics, the use of a wide variety of musical instruments, and a variety of song versions for &quot;Carpe diem&quot;."
1705,5,"This is a recording that children will listen to. In a fast paced world, it almost seems like to much to ask of our kids to sit and listen to a story on a recording. Having been a preschool teacher I can honestly say that most all my children listen carefully, and some even got tears in their eyes as they realized what was happening to Jesus. This is a wonderfully told, easy-to-listen-to story of what a tree would have seen and done in Jesus's time. It gives the kids some insight, and it may help them to ask you questions about Jesus."
1706,5,"The title is perfect for the album. This is one of the heaviest metal albums out there. I haven't heard a record from the U.K. like this in some time. The balance of metal and even harder metal is superb on this. This is going to join the ranks of Celtic Frost, Slayer, and S.O.D. It gets my seal.<br />-FM"
1707,5,This DVD has everything you could want in a music DVD.It is very well put together. The Cult is my favorite 80's band and it's all<BR>here although the later songs do drag on a little I'm very glad <BR>I have this.
1708,5,"There are very few discs that when I first listen to it, I realize that it is a gem.  I remember a friend of mine in college that had a concept of what he called &quot;the perfect album.&quot;  &quot;Most of the time&quot; he said, &quot;even the best of albums force you to suffer through a very dismal song, but every so often, every single song works perfect.&quot;  Out of nowhere, Shave Librarian has created the perfect album.  And they have done it in a very unexpected way, by fusing pop and a sort of mysterious groove that changes every time you think as a listener that you've nailed it.  I think the perfect album is a really hard thing to achieve in days when the music market seems less than inspired.  You might be able to hit some generic riff and wear it to death as so many do, but it is truly refreshing to hear a band that is innovating in an inspired way and is still 100% a thrill to hear."
1709,5,"As I find with all of Enya's albums--there are a couple of tracks on this one that really stand out, while the rest tend to blend into the background. Am I disappointed--no. Her albums are the only ones that I never feel like I've bought the whole album for the sake of one or two songs. I love a few, I like the rest, and I don't feel cheated by any of them. What a deal!!! If you like Enya, don't pass this one by."
1710,5,"This is one of my favorite CDs.  Every song on it is consistently good.  It was composed before the band lost Duckworth, so this is REK at his best!  If you like country and are tired of the top-40 they play on country radio these days, try this."
1711,3,"Wow....one really doesnt know how to feel after listening to this grand and very powerful production.Dont expect any melodiec little tunes or soft dilicate piano .....expect instead to be fully awoken.I am a huge fan of vangelis especially the way he is always able to weave magical flowing atmospheres around simple tunes.I bought this album and laid down , closed my eyes and expected to be taken on a dreamy experience , instead i was totally unable to relax .All my senses just jumped to alertness.One definiately feels like one should be watching a visual to this soundtrack.Very opera , with a very mystical accient Greek feel.Very Vangelis but very heavy to listen to.It might have been nice to have found a little calmness amoungst it all.I know over time it will become another Vangelis album i will listen to again and again .IM very interested to hear other peoples opinions and how the album made them feel."
1712,5,Basicamente los mejores discos de Frankie Ruiz son los que salieron en los 80. Este es uno de ellos.  Todos los temas son buenos; casi todo de ellos estan en los discos  de los mejores exitos de el.
1713,5,"After hearing the new CD release, &quot;Tenderly&quot;, it was evident that we will be hearing much more from this new talent.  As I listened to the words, there were feelings behind each word and it came from Ms. King's heart.  I know I will be enjoying this CD for a long time and I look forward to Geri King's future releases."
1714,5,"Shawn is a master of the story telling song, and a great guitar player! This CD spends a lot of time in my player!"
1715,1,"As a long time fan of Bob Dylan, and as one who has dutifully bought every album that he has ever produced, I have to repectfully disagree with all the reviews which I have read. With one exception, I find the songs on Love and Theft to be almost unlistenable. As I look back on the last couple of decades of Dylan albums, I find an interesting trend: Each record contains one gem amidst a lot of filler. Songs like Not Dark Yet, Every Grain of Sand, Born in time, Brownsville Girl, Series of Dreams, and the recent Things Have Changed (which did not appear on an album) all sparkle like diamonds discovered in a rock pile. Perhaps Bob only has one great song in him per year, and maybe that's enough, maybe that's as much as any great poet has ever produced.The gem on this album is Missisippi, and it is, by itself, worth the price of the record."
1716,5,"It is because of Darryl's music that I now find myself writing a CD review for the first time. I love Darryl's CD and every song on it!! Since I heard him live and bought the CD, I have to hear his CD every day and will probably buy a second one to keep one at work and one at home. His sound is pure Country at its very best!! His &quot;Second Wind&quot; video is what I first got hooked to and now the rest is history - I cannot get enough of all the songs on this CD. I love &quot;Who's Gonna Get me over You&quot; - is has such a fun beat and cool sound and the way he sings &quot;Those Less Fortunate Than I&quot; is so soulful and beautiful! I strongly recommend this CD to anyone who truly enjoys pure country music!!"
1717,5,"I go to clubs occasionally and from the moment I heard the song &quot;Me&quot; I was hooked.  I then had to find out who this amazing singer was.  Through some searching I discovered Kina.  Then the song &quot;Girl from The Gutter.&quot;  Well I introduced that song to my friend Susan who I think loves it more than I.  She even played it at her wedding.  On a note from the wedding which I gave to her it said &quot;To everyone else, your just Susan, but You'll always be a Girl from the Gutter to me.&quot;  Kina has a very unique sound and I hope that she gets the recognition from the industry she deserves.  She's truly an original.  &quot;Hey Kina, if your out there listening... Let me know if you need a duet partner.&quot;"
1718,3,"Without 2pac in the outlaw lineup, the Outlaw Immortal cd 'Ride wit us, or Collide wit us&quot; isnt what it could of been... Anybody who isnt a diehard Pac fan, or Outlaw fan, prolly wouldnt enjoy this CD... There are a few tracks on here that are cool, prolly most of all Outlaw 2000, but it is still an Outlaw Immortalz CD, and anyone who is a fan, should get it..."
1719,5,"I love Plus One! They really are talented guys that want to serve God!! Some people think when they hear about Plus One oh their in it for the fame. But their not. I got their video and their in it for God. They are great guys! Jason(one of the guys) said that he wants to be humble and not prideful. He said I love meeting our fans. They all have great personaleties!! The group Plus One is made up of Jason, Nate, Jeremy,Nathan,and Gabe. All their songs on the cd are great!! Written On My Heart has a good beat and wonderful lyrics talking about God! God Is In This Place has very good lyrics talking about how God is with you! The Promise is a great song talking about one of God's great promises! My Life is a great song with a awesome beat! Soul Tatoo is a great song with very good lyrics! I Will Rescue You is agreat song about how God will rescue you in hard times. When Your Spirit Gets To Weak is another great song about how God will be their for you. Last Flight Out is a pretty love song,and has clean lyrics. Run To You is another great song about how you can Run To God in hard times. Be is another pretty love song with clean lyrics. Hear  In My Heart is a pretty love song about your true love and is very clean.My Friend is a pretty song about friendship. If you like other boybands but you do not like their lyrics. Buy the promise, you won't be disappointed!! I love Plus One!! They are my favorite group!! Thank You Plus One!!"
1720,4,"This complete version on Legacy 65143 is an important historical document, but it's too bad that in releasing it Sony withdrew the eminently listenable Columbia G2K-40244 2-CD set (identical to the old LP set), which preserved nearly all of this wonderful concert, editing out the ruined portions, and the extraneous applause and talk.  On the withdrawn old set, Disc 1 starts with &quot;Don't Be That Way&quot;, omits the spoiled &quot;Sometimes I'm Happy&quot;, and ends with &quot;The Man I Love&quot; as track 12.  Disc 2 starts with &quot;I Got Rhythm&quot; and proceeds through &quot;Sing Sing Sing&quot;, then skips &quot;If Dreams Come True&quot;, ending with &quot;Big John's Special&quot; as track 11.  Total times aren't indicated, but Disc 1 is 48:59, Disc 2 is 53:03.  The sound on this set isn't audiophile quality, of course, but it's still amazingly clean and clear throughout, much better than might be expected for a 1938 recording.  This was issued in a regular 2-CD box, not slimline, titled &quot;Benny Goodman - Live at Carnegie Hall&quot; (without the word &quot;Complete&quot;), and the front cover carries the logo &quot;Columbia Jazz Masterpieces&quot;; it is NOT a Columbia/Legacy issue.  The Legacy &quot;Complete&quot; was issued in 11/99, so there may still be copies of this old version around somewhere.  It's well worth hunting for."
1721,4,"erin mckeown, not to be confused with susan mckeown, is great!  actually susan is great, too, but that's another review i suppose.<br />sometimes, i get a new cd and put it on and you think: what was the return policy at that record store?  other times, i get a new cd and put it on and think: wow! that was a bargain.  well, this was a bargain.  now, i am trying to figure out whether or not buying her whole catalog of music is in my budget.<br />distillation is a blend of folk, jazz, blues, country, tin pan alley, and a little dash of alternative rock sensibilities thrown in.  overall its great and the blend works.  also, the production is amazing.  my favorites are la petite mort (do you get the joke--the french refer to a certain pleasurable something as a small death)  and the little cowboy.  <br />the only reason i didn't give it a five out of five was that as an album there are a couple of moments where my interested lagged slightly waiting for the next theme to come along, mainly in how to open my heart in 4 easy steps and dirt gardener.  but as an artist and musician i give erin mckeown a 6 out of 5.  her guitar playing is fantastic, her voice evocative.  when the song is sad, her voice sounds sad.  when the song sounds happy her voice has a jovial tone.  <br />buy it!!!!  it's a good one and a nice change of pace if you are looking for something new."
1722,5,"Krall's entire catalog is remarkable. But &quot;The Look Of Love&quot; covers some new ground for her - working with orchestras. Some Krall purists may whine about the departure from her stripped-down 4-piece group, but the song selection on this disc coheres very well with the large, lush orchestral accompianament. I own 4 Krall CDs. All are good in their own way, but this new one is so beautifully lush and soothing to listen to that it is fast becoming my favorite. I should mention that I am a dyed-in-the-wool rock and roll fan first and foremost, but Krall (especially this new CD) enthralls!"
1723,1,"This is such a disgrace.  These songs do not have the emotional impact without the words, especially when played by a mediocre pianist with new age sensibilities and indulging in pretentious techniques even a beginning piano student can accomplish.  This is Muzak.  Nothing more."
1724,5,"I really found nothing wrong with Slipknot's self-titled album. I mean I do agree that these guys don't have alot of talent in some areas, but the energy that they bring to the table is just incredible. So I was skeptical about their new album entitled IOWA. Well everybody that says that these guys have sold out and that they suck, can stick it up their ... Slipknot have gone death metal. Pure brutality. As simple as that. I read in one review of this album that Slipknot have stuck a blood covered knife down the throats of their listeners and they are going to make you like it. I could not agree more. A perfect way to sum up Iowa. Corey Taylor(8), continues to be one of the most talented singers in metal. With his full on assault of ferocious screams and beautiful melodies, Taylor will continue to lead the attack that is Slipknot.Of course Joey Jordison(1), continues to be one of the best drummers out there, as he continues his fast pounding and full on assault.<BR>Slipknot have definitly scored a perfect 5 with me on Iowa. Its's time for people to stop disliking these guys due to the masks and jumpsuits, and it is time for people to start looking deep into the realm of savagry that is Slipknot.<br />Tracks of note: People=..., Disasterpiece, Everything Ends, The Heretic Anthem, Gently, Left Behind, The Shape, New Abortion, and Iowa"
1725,5,"i perchased this cd on January 2001! When i got home and listened to i loved it, all songs were great. Some of my fav song's are, Where does my heart beat now, thats the way it is, the power of the dream, amar haciendo el amor, pour que tu m'aimes encore... Celine your truely the best singer in the world And that is saying alot ,too=) :) ;) =) Well for those of you who dont have this cd already please buy this cd! It is 10/10. If i could i would give this cd 10 starz's=)"
1726,4,"Its so easy to give a good CD 5 stars... in reality, I give this MOS release a solid 4+. The ATB disc is very good with some standard trance stuff that overall is enjoyable. But the Acosta CD will grab hold of you and not let go... its an incredible mix that never lets up (the CD blows up with Derb). If you like trance and want that let-it-rip-at-3-am feeling, Acosta's disc will take you there... the energy just doesn't stop. This double CD is WELL worth the money. It will without question find a home among your favorites."
1727,5,"As usual this c.d. was a masterful work.  Fun and yet thought provocing while driving.  A good c.d. to unwind to after a long day!  Howard University consistantly turned out fabulous, entriguing musicians when I attended in the late seventies and early eighties.  These guys are still funking and grooving, reminding us that sometimes...a little older &quot;is&quot; better!  Great going Greg!"
1728,5,"After buying &quot;Octopus&quot; i had to see what else Gentle Giant had to offer.  With &quot;life in a glass house&quot; i'm now a full fledged Gentle Giant fan.  Before my &quot;discovery&quot; of GG i had always thought about the type of band i'd like to create; Gentle giant is all that and then some.  I love all the instruments they've incorporated into their music, and the unique sounds they've managed to tap from them never bores me, they're an endless musical journey.  I think what really gives them their unique sound must be accredited to their singers.  Those sweet sweet reniassance, madrigal sounding voices.  With harmonies like those of GG, one must have an incredible musical grasp; i'm guessing it's something they've always had rather than learned.  Never before have i witnessed a rock band dwell among the ledgendary musical minds of Mozart and Beethoven as Gentle Giant.  I can easilly see GG aiming for the impossible as had Mozart, and this is why i'm so in awe of them.  &quot;How'd they think to do that&quot; would be my most often thought when i listen to &quot;life in a glass house&quot;.  An aspiring musician such as myself can only dream of the level at which GG were at when creating their music."
1729,5,"By far the best CD that they have released to date. It uplifts me when I am down, and helps me prepare to enter the presence of the Lord when I am alone.<br />I usually listen to parts of it everyday.<br />Highly recommended as the best of the Third Day collection."
1730,1,"Uli is as good as any guitarist when he is at his best. Prologue to the Symphonic Legends and Beyond the Astral Skies are two of the greatest CDs ever made. It is as if Mozart and Jimi Hendrix had a kid and the kid was Uli. Unfortunately this CD is a bizarre mish mash of junk Uli has recorded over the years. Some of it is interesting, like the first song, but a lot of it is boring, like the classical covers... who cares if Uli can do a mediocre rendition of a Vivaldi piece on the electric guitar. If you can't play it extremely well, or you can't do something innovative with it (other than just playing it on the electric guitar), you are better off working in your home studio doing the sequel to Prologue to the Symphonic Legends. Uli is not the most productive musician around, with just three CD releases in the last 16 years. Let's just hope he is hard at work on his second symphonic masterpiece. Then all will be forgiven."
1731,4,"This album sounds different than what I expected, I think the lyrics are very well written, the sound goes from heavy to mild between the songs, suburban has shades of a concept album in it, something which is not done today...would like to see this band perform live...very good...av"
1732,4,"&quot;Automatic for the people&quot; is one of my all times favourite albums. No surprise I was captured by &quot;Reveal&quot; which come back to the guitar oriented style we knew before &quot;Adventures in hi-fi&quot; and &quot;Up&quot;. I liked both but found them more difficult to appreciate. To put it short: this is an excellent album to dream on, drive to or ponder about. In fact, a good old clasic REM piece. Its qualities include the crafted, mysterious and poetic lyrics Michael Stipe used us to and the solid melodies.<br />Most songs are straight rock songs in the line of &quot;Automatic&quot;, the major exception being &quot;I've been high&quot;, which would have fit &quot;Adventures&quot; and &quot;Up&quot;. It was an instant favourite: the almost trip-hop feeling is honey to my ears.<br />Other personal highlights are &quot;She just wants to be&quot; with its great deep rhythm section and catchy chorus, &quot;Disappear&quot; for the wonderful bittersweet lyrics, &quot;Saturn return&quot; a lullaby and a short movie and &quot;I'll take the rain&quot;, a dreamy REM classic I rocked myself on gently. &quot;Chorus and the ring&quot; surprises by a light celtic feeling, &quot;Imitation of life&quot; is the most upbeat song of the album, overall rather slow, and probably the closest to the &quot;old&quot; REM. The second single &quot;Reno&quot; will get you humming along the sticking chorus. It might not be a revolutionary REM opus, it is still high quality and recommended material."
1733,5,"This band is awesome, it features Jimmy and Joey of Eyehategod. The music puts you in a trance-like state. This is highly recommended."
1734,5,"Many people start discussing Train by comparing their sound to the Counting Crows.  Train's sound is similar to the Counting Crows, and the CD in question, \\""Drops of Jupiter,\\"" will come to rival the now-classic \\""August and Everything After.\\"" But unlike CC, Train's lyrics emerge from the depths and paint a picture (sometimes whimsically) of hope and enlightenment. \\""Can you imagine no love, pride, deep fried chicken/Your best friend always sticking up for you?\\"" on the title track reminds a wayward girl of what she's missing while searching for herself out there. The song is a fine vehicle for Pat Monahan's melodious, unadulterated voice and Jimmy, Rob and Charlie's wholesome 3-part harmony. <br />While DOJ is the anchor, hard-driving rock anthems like \\""She's on Fire\\"" and \\""Respect\\"" show off Jimmy Stafford's (guitar) and Scott Underwood's (drums) musical/rhythmic prowess. The CD comes to a comfortable close with \\""Getaway\\"" and \\""Mississippi\\"" that groove with jazzy, syncopated angst. While other bands dare not, the musicians of Train push themselves musically by adding piano, strings, saxophone (2-types, I might add), trumpet and mandolin to the guitar-centered line-up. Dare they do and the risk has paid off! Overall, the CD is not only a must purchase for any serious music lover, but also a permanent placement in that CD changer."
1735,4,"This CD is tight!! Classic west coast beats and lyrics. Kurupt and guests keep it gangsta throughout album.A must have for any rap fan.Also, buy D-12,St Lunatics,P Diddy (i hate to say it, but its good),and Tha Dogg Pound 2002.I cant wait for \\""Makaveli and Dillinger : Dont Go To Sleep\\""!"
1736,4,"A lot of critical attention has been drawn to the resonant acoustic in which these performances were recorded. The original Gramophone reviewer for example commended the 'natural' balance and perspective, while the Amazon's reviewer David Hurwitz (an anti-authentic critic if there ever was one!) referred to both sound and performance as 'utterly grotesque'! I personally favour the former evaluation; while the reverberance may not be to everybody's taste, it does mean that the brass can let rip without overwhelming the rest of the orchestra, and gives the string tone a warmth and bloom not found on other period cycles. While the woodwind may at times appear 'disembodied' this is a very minor cavil and again this is a subjective issue.     As for the performances themselves, I personally find them far preferable to such rivals as Hogwood and Gardiner; the directorship of Goodman allows more freedom of expression than the former, while avoiding the at times wilful excesses of Gardiner. Overall these are played with zing and character, two qualities Beethoven would have surely admired."
1737,5,"Unlike many other reviewers here, I prefer LSD's newer, more electronic sound to their older work.  As much as I enjoyed past albums, each song was so similar to the next that they all blended together.  Yet Flux has many standout tracks (&quot;Psyche,&quot; &quot;Nova,&quot; &quot;Ring,&quot; &quot;Sunset Bell&quot;).  Also, unlike past LSD albums which served mainly for late night, introspective listens, Flux is also great in a club or for long, late night drives.  Personaly, I don't think the electronic aspects of this album take away from the ethereal qualities of LSD at all."
1738,5,"Oh Yeahhhhhh. Blink 182 is back to it's original sound, This one is muc~h more like Chishire Cat or Buddha which proves that blink AND punk are still alive!! Just buy the CD and listen and listen and listen and........ lai lai lai Blink forever!!"
1739,5,"I agree with the previous reviewer that this is certainly not the &quot;Ultimate&quot; Bill Evans, but to get that I think you would need to buy the 18 cd set &quot;The Complete Bill Evans on Verve&quot;. What Herbie Hancock has done here though, as he states in the liner notes, he decided to pick the performances that he liked the best, regardless of the settings. And this is what we get. Booklet includes an essay on Bill, by Herbie, and his thoughts on each track. It would have been nice to have some with Scott LaFaro playing, but still, this is a good collection, and a good place to start for people who wish to get to know Bill Evan's work. It's a good jumping off place."
1740,5,"Sally Mayes is a treasure. She has an exceptional voice and that special ability to convey not only the words and notes of a song, but also its meaning. To be honest, a few of the songs in this set could have remain unpublished without any loss to the listening public; but there is sufficient good material to make me happy I got this particular CD. It leaves me with the hope that Ms. Mayes will be putting out more recordings in the months ahead."
1741,5,"...Thank you for your delivery of Works Vol. 2  I purchased this a long time ago when life was not so kind. It saw me through til I lent my albums to an uncle who allowed them to be stolen. Upon reciept of this CD I was immediately brought to tears by \\""Watching Over You\\"".   This Vol. is spectacular and a must if truly a fan of ELP. An excellent angled view of Brain Salad Surgery, and don't forget Father Christmas. It is and always has been deeply moving."
1742,5,"&quot;Crush With Eyeliner&quot; is a solid track from Monster, not the best song from the album, but good none the less.  The reason to get single is for the three live songs.  &quot;Fall On Me&quot; is a R.E.M. classic, Mike Mills does his best Kate Pierson imitation on the superb &quot;Me In Honey&quot; and &quot;Finest Worksong&quot; is outstanding."
1743,4,"I bought this CD the week it came out, and I'm definately not disappointed.  The first and last third of the CD (tracks 1-9, 17-22) are high energy, and work well for long-distance driving or working out at the gym.  There's a strange section in the middle (10:Scar,11:Key,12:End of the World) where the mixers did some strange slow-reggae-like mixing.  And &quot;teddybear&quot; probably shouldn't have been a dance-remix.  Which is why this gets a four, not a five.<br />Strangely enough, Amazon lists this as a single CD with 26 tracks, but it's actually a two-cd set, where the last four tracks on their track listing is on the &quot;Extended Vox&quot; disc (full remix versions of those songs)."
1744,3,"I bought this CD to bring to some of my 1st/2nd grade dance classes I teach.  Really, by the third or fourth class I was ready to move on.  Some of the songs are just feeble attempts at making another classic Cruella DeVille song (Remember the first one?) and Digga Digga Dog is just painful.  That's not to say there aren't some enjoyable tracks on this CD.  I actually really like the song Whatcha Gonna Do? by Nobody's Angel.  And who'd think Disney could get Thunderpuss to do a song for a kids soundtrack?  He remade Freak Out, and the results are pretty good.  Puppy Love is ok.  The kids love it anyways.  Judging from the reaction I got from my students, I'd say this is the perfect CD for kids 1st to 3rd grade.  Any older and this will sound way too cheesy and childish.  It's actually a good start for younger kids into pop music.  But if you are 12+, you will hate this."
1745,2,"After listening to Marillion's strong 1997 album This Strange Engine, I had high hopes for 1998's Radiation.  Unfortunately, I came away feeling let down.  It's not just because the acoustic underpinnings of Engine were discarded in favor of a loud, guitar-and-techno sound.  I can live with that.  What really killed the album for me is that the band moved away from writing melodic songs, and instead headed into the dusty wilderness of formless progressive rock.<br />The fact is, Yes trod all this ground thirty years ago on Close to the Edge, and it wasn't very good *then*, either.<br />The album's high point is the vaguely pop-sounding &quot;Under the Sun&quot;, although it's hardly innovative or challenging stuff.  The other end of the spectrum is &quot;Three Minute Boy&quot;, a pointless cacophony with an arrangement reminiscent of &quot;An Accidental Man&quot; from Engine, but without the melodic elements that made that song (one of the weaker tracks on Engine) worthwhile.<br />Sadly, Radiation represents exactly where Marillion should not be going:  It's loud, muddled and dull.  (At least Brave was only muddled and dull, and it had one genuine triumph in &quot;Made Again&quot;.)  As good as these musicians are, all their chops are for naught if they don't rein themselves in with strong melodies and tight arrangements (heck, this was evident as far back as their first album, Script for a Jester's Tear!)  I haven't yet listened to their next album (Marillion.com), but I truly hope they saw their error and returned to building on their most solid Hogarth-era album in Engine."
1746,4,"This San Francisco trio is going to get compared, ad nauseam, to The Jesus &amp; Mary Chain circa Psychocandy.  Well, B.R.M.C. is that, and a lot more.  The feedback is here, but under a tighter rein, which gives the loaded melodies freer reign, and though there's darkness in the contours, these Bay area boys don't wallow in the mire, they rock themselves out of it.  There are echoes of great bands from the past twenty years, but the nifty trick BRMC pulls off is that even though they mix elements of gothic, glam, techno, punk, they never sound slavish to any one sound.  They aren't too deathly serious about it all, either, most noticeably at the beginning of \\""As Sure as the Sun\\"", when guitarist Peter Hayes punctuates his gothic blues with electric blasts of \\""Also Sprach Zarathustra\\""."
1747,4,"A big Sanborn fan, this is good sax work but not his best.<br />Fine cuts on Lesley Ann, Pyramid and So Far Away.  Seems to kind of get in a rut on the rest, sound alot alike."
1748,4,"Johnny Hodges returns to Duke's band after a 5 year absence and just blows everybody away!  Highlights include what may be Hodges' most seductive, sensual solo ever on &quot;Prelude to a Kiss,&quot; and an incredibly salty, greasy blues solo on &quot;Long Time Blues,&quot; which shows why B. B. King was such an admirer of Johnny Hodges. All the solos on &quot;Long Time Blues&quot; are exemplary, as Hodges gives way to Ray Nance, followed by an astounding solo by Harry Carney.  Jimmy Hamilton brings it all to a close with a breathtaking clarinet solo.  There is much good stuff to listen to from Ray Nance and Clark Terry throughout. Paul Gonsalves shines brilliantly on &quot;Satin Doll,&quot; and &quot;Moon Mist&quot; features the kind of Ellington harmonies that will leave even the most formally trained wondering &quot;What's THAT chord?&quot; for days.   Unfortunately, &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; and &quot;Love You Madly&quot; proove to be little more than filler here, but the rest of the titles show Duke to being using his band to its best abilities, just a few months before they made jazz history at Newport."
1749,5,"If you are just getting into RATM, this is the place to start. Every song is good, hell every song is excellent! This is music meant to be played loud! The lyrics of Zack de la Rocha fume with politics and Tom Morello's unique guitar stylings accompany them perfectly. Looking back 20 years from now, this will be up their with &quot;Who's Next?&quot; and &quot;Zepplin 4&quot; as a classic album. Although de la Rocha left the band last year, the music and its message will not fade away anytime soon."
1750,4,"It was with pleasure that I noted that the Hogwood versions of the Brandenburg's are still available.  It is easy to forget that these were a strike out onto the holy ground of original instruments and scoring and were somewhat revolutionary at their recording.<br />Bach selected work originally done for Prince Leopold's orchestra at Cothen and revised these six concerti to suit the Margrave's limited resources at Brandenburg.  Because Bach's objectives were often to achieve textural as well as thematic variations, several of the concerti exist in multiple revisions.  All of this makes the conductor's choices difficult if scholarship is important.  Hogwood has made sensible rather than radical decisions, and we are very likely enjoying the music as the Margrave did originally.<br />The performances are intense.  Tempos are a bit faster than traditional tempo's of the time and the musicianship is right on for the most part.  We often forget that original instruments where a bit more difficult to steer than their modern heirs.  Horns had some odd notes in their range, and oboes were often used in trumpetlike passages.  The orchestra and soloists do an excellent job of managing these difficulties.<br />Sound is dry, but complex.  Original instruments provide resonant sonorities that can be delightful, but are rarely earthmoving.  The inner movement of the parts is quite audible which makes these versions especially interesting.  The recording itself is typical of the early 1980's, which means that it could be a bit better.  Sonics are clear, but I wish that there was a bit more directionality and spatial sense.<br />The price makes this one of the best Brandenburg buys available.  An excellent purchase for the student."
1751,5,"i live in indonesia,i got poison the well album from my friend,and i can't talk much but i think it was very exploiting. that's all,i can't talk to much,i was very like it."
1752,2,"Before I get into the review, let me set a few facts straight...<br />Travis Meeks IS Days of the New, he plays all the instruments on the records. Todd, Matt, and Jesse were touring members, they were NOT fired!<br />Now, on to the record.  These guys have pooled their resources, and made a decent record.  However, the sound is uncomfortably like Days of the New.  While a few tracks stray away from the Days of the New sound, too many of them lack the originality to keep things interesting.  <br />However, when they DO stray from the familar sound, they've come up with great tunes.  The piano-laced &quot;Mourning&quot;, and the poppish &quot;I Don't Care&quot; stand up on their own, and will keep you interested. They do a great job with backing vocals as well.  The cd would benefit with a more diverse sound.  <br />So, if you enjoy post-grunge or acoustic, the cd will be worth your money.  But Travis Meeks IS Days of the New!  Accept NO imitations.  (BTW, his new cd, the Red Album is coming out this summer.  I've heard some of it, and you wil LOVE it!)"
1753,1,"I was never a fan of Kid Rock, but hearing him screw up Sad But True on American Badass, and seeing him screw up the kick @$$ lineup at Summer Sanitarium cemented my hatred of him. He is redneck rap, he a combination of country and rap. He crucified Sad But True, I will never be able to listen to that song without thinking of how this greaseball crucified it. His live show at Summer Sanitarium: the only redeeming part was the strippers, and when Kid Rock finally got off stage(why couldn't they leave the strippers out there the whole time?). Everyone there was booing him and throwing stuff at him. I honestly feel sorry for the securtiy guards at his shows who have to control thousands of drunk rednecks holding lighters. And I'm glad the midget is dead, it didn't serve any real purpose. We can only hope that Kid Rock's career is now ever. I'm done now, any more ripping on him would be a waste of my time and yours."
1754,5,"This soundtrack is intelligent, diverse and fresh (unlike the movie).  It contains wonderful brazilian music paired with terrific new or not-yet-heard of artists.  I love the Shawn Colvin song and many of the artists I hadn't heard before.  My favorite by far was Eman's &quot;Wonderfully Strange&quot;, a completely original and inventive song.  His voice is so moving and passionate.  Hoping I can find a record of his.  For now I'll settle for at least the one song on a great soundtrack!"
1755,5,"I had never really been a fan of Bjork up until in 1997 when this album came out. It's not that I didn't like her, I just never really paid any attention to her. Then one day in the store, I saw Homogenic on the shelf, and I remembered hearing of all the good things about it. So, I finally gave in and bought it; I am so glad I did too.<br />     I know that a CD is really good if I can listen through the entire album without having to get up and change it to the next track. In Homogenic, every single track is great, whether it's the string-filled &quot;Joga&quot; or the screaming, pounding &quot;Pluto&quot;, all ten tracks are brilliant. My favorite tracks, although I like all of them, are &quot;5 Years&quot;, in which Bjork, accompanied by three organ chords and a drum machine, wails 'I'm so bored of cowards who say what they want, but they can't handle love'; &quot;Unravel&quot;, where Bjork solemnly tells her lover 'The devil collects it, our love in a ball of yarn... so when you come back, we'll have to make new love'; and &quot;All is Full of Love&quot;, a beautiful closing track featuring a distorted bass hiding in the background while strings and synths dominate the foreground, all the while Bjork screaming 'All is full of love!' It gives me shivers every time I listen to it.<br />     I strongly suggest that you give Homogenic a try, even if you're not a fan of Bjork. I wasn't, and now this album is in my top 20 CDs of all-time. Just give it a try; I think you'll find it very interesting."
1756,5,good music
1757,5,"In some ways, &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; is the antithesis of the Beatles lackluster salvage job, &quot;Let It Be.&quot; For one thing, this album rocks and after listening to it, you'll see why the Stones are the world's greatest rock 'n' roll band. Though The Who may have something to say about that!<br />The best tracks on this album are &quot;Monkey Man&quot;--a song any former junkie will relate to--the highly suggestive &quot;Let It Bleed,&quot; the sneering &quot;Live With Me&quot; and the AOR classic, &quot;Midnight Rambler.&quot; However, if you want a better version of &quot;Midnight Rambler,&quot; just listen to &quot;Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out&quot; and you'll see what I mean.<br />&quot;Love In Vain&quot; is a good number too though it does sound like Jagger had too much to drink before he recorded it. &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; and &quot;You Can't Always Get What You Want&quot; are more AOR staples that are classic pieces in their own right, however, I think they've gotten too much air play over the years and now seem a bit cliche'.<br />Overall, this is one of the Stones' better albums and I highly recommend it to every fan."
1758,4,"So, your overtly obsessive fixation on Elliot Smith has brought you to the point where you seem to feel the need to listen to something different. Fear not, as you have found Heatmiser, musicians who seem to, in my ears, sound better than many of the indie seeds who have blossomed into grumpy flowers still not content with their lives. There is substance here, certainly not a negative point, but you must focus all your aural attention on the up-and-down flow of this post-grunge explosion to find it. It is strange, however, to look back and not help but notice that Elliot and Sam's newer works seem to have mellowed out, as tracks like &quot;Get Lucky&quot; prove. No matter what you think of it, this record is destined to become an indie cult essential for years to come. Post grunge explosion for the non believers...Elliot and Sam's pre-project."
1759,5,"I got Lonely Grill last year in 2000 and everyone been telling me to buy this Cd and so I did and I am happy that I got it. All the songs are awesome. My favorites are: &quot;Come Cryin' to me&quot;, &quot;John Doe on a John Deere&quot;, &quot;You walked in&quot;, &quot;Say when&quot; and &quot;What do we do with the rest of the night&quot;. I really love all of song though. Richie and John do a awesome job singing all of the songs. I love the beat to all of song. That the best part on the Cd I love the most.<br />Hope all you that love Lonestar (like I do) will buy this Cd. You will get your money worth. Enjoy"
1760,5,"No longer played by country radio has turned out to be one of the best things for Dolly Parton's career as it has challenged her the record the type of music she wants to record, rather than what she thinks she has to record.<br />The trend began with &quot;Hungry Again,&quot; but really hit its stride with the remarkable &quot;The Grass is Blue,&quot; and it continues with &quot;Little Sparrow,&quot; an album that takes in much of the same bluegrass territory its predecessor did, but adds celtic touches to it to create the type of music Dolly enjoyed hearing as she grew up in the mountains of east Tennessee.  Guests, such as Alison Krauss, Rhonda Vincent, and the Irish band Altan abound here.<br />Nashville may have sold out its soul to the highest bidder, but with the recent turn in her career Dolly has become its conscious.  Let's hope it listens."
1761,5,"if you have not given ur valentine a gift yet, this is the best way to do it. very romantic and great songs, sony music does a great thing to make a collection of such songs, buy it, i have it, i recommend it"
1762,5,"Judy at Carnegie Hall is a gift of unharnessed, sheer, joyful electricity to and beyond the nth degree - magnificent!  The black-box issue was, forty years ago, and remains the finest recording ever made by the best show business entertainer ever, in her pinnacle comeback.  Cash Box 7/22/61 called it &quot;Two Hours of Just Pow!&quot; and it is that and more:  splendiferous.  It was a privilege to have seen and heard the precious, rare gem that is this truly one-of-a-kind:  Judy Garland.  Five Stars?   Six!"
1763,4,"I must say I agree with Gregory M. Zinkl, who already has reviewed this 2-CD set.  I bought the set for the Concerto in D for Lute (of course also for Guitar), my favorite Vivaldi concerto by far.  As a result I listen to the 2nd CD a lot and the 1st CD with The Four Seasons and others I rarely listen to at all.  If you are looking for a definitive Four Seasons I defer to Gregory's suggestion that you should look elsewhere.  If that is not the case, then just regard having a servicable, if not exceptional, performance of The Four Seasons as a bonus to getting the real &quot;meat&quot; of this CD, the 2nd CD.  For the price you can't go wrong."
1764,5,"I thought Ferry couldn't top 'Boys and Girls' but he has done so with Mamouna.  '39 Steps', with it's relentless, mesmerizing beat is the high point of the work.  If there is a 'perfect' cd recording, this would be a candidate."
1765,3,"THE NEW RECORDING WAS MADE IN KOLN AFTER A SUCESSFULL CONCERT PERFORMANCE OF THIS RARE OPERA. THE ONLY RECORDING AVAILIBLE BEFORE WAS ON SUPRAPHON LABEL (A CZECH RADIO PRODUKTION FROM THE 1950TH) WHICH WAS HEAVILY CUT FROM ITS CURRENT 164 MINUTES TO 92) SO OBVIOUSLY THIS NEW RECORDING MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR THE FIRST TIME TO HEAR MORE THAN ONE ADDITIONAL HOUR OF MUSIC. THIS IS THE ONLY BIG ADVANTAGE OF THIS SET. SOPRANO OLGA ROMANKO SINGS WITH A DARK TONE, BUT HER INTONATION, AS WELL AS DICTION IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. I DID SEE HER ON FEW OCCASIONS (AS LEONORA IN TROVATORE &amp; DESDEMONA IN OTELLO), BUT BOTH SUFFERED FROM THE SAME PROBLEM. IRINA TSCHISTJAKOVAS DARK MEZZO IS ALSO UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE, RESEMBELING A LOT THE CZECH MEZZOSOPRANO VERA SOUKUPOVA (EX. ERDA IN BOHMS RING). THE ONLY CZECH SINGERS ARE TENOR PETR STRAKA &amp; IVAN KUSNJER, BOTH NOT VERY ATTRACTIVE IN COLOR, BUT VOCALY SECURE. GERD ALBRECHT CONDUCTS THIS GRAND CZECH OPERA ALLA MEYERBEER WITH SENSE FOR DETAIL, BUT IT IS PITY THAT HE WAS NOT ABLE TO COLLABORATE WITH A BETTER QUARTET OF PRINCIPALS (TODAYS EVA URBANOVA OR GABRIELA BENACKOVA, EVA RANDOVA &amp; PETER DVORSKY IN THEIR PRIME WOULD BEEN MORE SUITABLE FOR THE DEMANDING PARTS). IF YOU LOVE DVORAK'S RUSALKA, BUY IT; IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE PIECE COMPLETE DO THE SAME; BUT IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE STYLE OF THE PIECE PLESE TURN TO THE SUPRAPHON RECORDING."
1766,5,"Eric Comstock's second album is even more accomplished than his first.  On this disc Comstock, one of the rising stars of New York cabaret, deftly performs the great songs of lyricist Lorenz Hart and composer Richard Rodgers.  Many of the most familiar songs are included (Blue Room, Mountain Greenery, My Heart Stood Still), as well as some almost never performed.  Of the rarer numbers, &quot;How Can You Forget&quot; with its obsessive lyric and pounding tempo, and the lilting &quot;What's the Use?&quot; are most memorable.  Very few of today's traditional singers risk unfamiliar material, which makes Comstock as near a goldmine as a music buffs are likely to find. Comstock sings these songs with confidence and precision, conveying all of the nuances of Hart's unsurpassed lyrics. The arrangements are more Jazz-influenced than those on his earlier album, but Comstock proves to be equally adept, as both pianist and singer, at performing them.  May Comstock reign for many years to come!"
1767,5,"Naked Baby Photos is the finest of all the Ben Folds Five albums. The rest of the albums are brilliant, but Naked Baby Photos has a little more spark and personality. This is Ben Folds Five before they `matured', but still, the band's catchy lyrics, their obvious musical virtuosity and Ben Folds' natural falsetto voice - it's still there and more outrageous than ever. From the groove of the opening track, Eddie Walker, to the mellow waltz of Boxing, Naked Baby Photos is an all round triumph. <br />Ben Folds plays the piano like a man possessed. One can never tell if what he is playing has been composed previously or improvised on the spot. Either way, whatever he plays is in key and spot on. He has a tremendous sense of rhythm and it seems as though his fingers know where to go before he does. That's probably the ingredient that makes Ben Folds Five such a unique and entertaining band. Their music sounds spontaneous and natural, and the fun the band has in making it carries through to the listener. Their music is lightweight but nevertheless, quite complex.<br />These are the hidden treasures of Ben Folds Five. The trio are masters of their field - they have the bizarre, enviable ability to improvise in time and in key, and make it sound good. Their rhythm, lyrics, musical ability, their joviality, the fun they have making music - all of it carries through to the listener, and what makes Naked Baby Photos the best of their albums is that it's got all of what I mentioned before in spades. This is an album that is not only a musical triumph, but it's also a hell of a lot of fun to listen to."
1768,5,"Words cannot convey the divinity of this music... It is clean like child's soul, charming like the sky. It is the most \\""truthful\\"" music one could ever had contemplated. These majestic melodies will bring you closer to your essence, your true \\""Self\\"". It will forever change your perception of music and Beauty in general."
1769,5,"Most people compare Bloem De Ligny to Bjork.  While their sound is similar I must say that Bloem (prounounced 'Bloom') is going in a somewhat different direction.  The music is very addictive and easy to listen to.  There is also a guest appearance by Les Claypool on the song &quot;Capsule&quot; but while he doesn't play bass, he lends his vocals.  This album is perfect for anyone who loves Bjork's early solo career (Debut &amp; Post) because, like Bjork used to do, Bloem is using more musicians than machines. It is captivating from the opening clavinet intro of &quot;Blue Nix&quot; to the bare guitar and vocals of &quot;Pink Serenity&quot;.  Definitely worth listening to over and over again."
1770,5,"yes, i gave this lots of stars only because i love tori.  mostly, i REALLY want bands to keep covering her because more and more Cheesy female singers without cool voices and lyrics are popping up.  i want to prevent that from happening!  bless anyone for contributing to tori amos in any way!"
1771,5,"David Allen is a refreshing new star in the music galaxy. His multitalents put him a step ahead of many in the business. David's music is fresh rock and very appealing. Heartfelt lyrics and superb hooks. I hope to see him excell to the top soon, because it's only a matter of time."
1772,5,Artbox is probably the best new band I have heard in 10 years. &quot;Oblivion&quot; is definately one of the finest moments in pop history Although the lyrics may scare the hell out of some people  I think this shows a great side of of artbox bands personality.
1773,5,"and what you get is music contained on this 2 CD set. To try and cover everything on this would require a book, so I`ll just say that this entire set has numerous highlights, like all of the great talent that Warren Haynes seems to always assemble. The players on each song rotate so much you need a program, but unlike most All- star jams, this one has each player pushing the other one,creating some incredible improvisational jamming.<br />There is the Derek Trucks Band, with Derek`s incredible Duane Allmanesque slide on Rastaman Chant, Edwin McCain, Col.Bruce Hampton with Jimmy Herring, two fifths of the Aquarium Rescue Unit, there`s Cry of Love playing together for the first time in five years. You have Larry McCray, brillant blues guitarist, Susan Tedeschi with her warm Bonnie Raitt like voice. Then the Mule`s set with it`s burning version of Bad Little Doggie, and then there`s blues legend Little Milton, doing a smoking When the Blues Come Knocking, and most of the gang performing 15 minutes of Merry Christmas Baby. <br /> This is a great CD of an incredible night. There were other great players there also, I`ll end it by saying if you like the Mule and great jamming, along with some musical surprises, this is it. Rest in Peace Allen Woody."
1774,5,"Chris De Burgh is as much a story teller as he is a singer. It's amazing how a song can tell such a powerful story, and this cd is full of such songs, whether they be love songs or dark, creepy songs like &quot;Spanish Train&quot; and &quot;Don't pay the ferryman&quot;. Then there's the fun &quot;Patricia the Stripper&quot; and the unique concept on the birth of Jesus on &quot;A Spaceman came calling&quot;. Chris De Burgh really does have an amazing knack with lyrics, and he has one of the best voices in pop. This is a fantastic album and highly recommended. 16 page booklet contains all lyrics and a couple of photos of Chris."
1775,5,"Sunnytime Soup delights my child everytime!  I liked the music, too.  In my book, that's a winning combination.  I found myself singing along with the provided lyric sheet.  Compared to other children's music this C.D. seemed to be fun for the whole family.  I highly recommend this C.D. for your family or for a gift your friends will enjoy.  The style of music ranges from rock 'n roll to lullaby.  A must have for any child- young or old!  (My daughter is 20 months old and loves it!)"
1776,2,"Sometimes you wonder why some people are pop S.T.A.R.S.. Geri Halliwell is surely one of them. When I saw her in her interviews I felt she is a very sympathetic and down-to-earth lady and she might be a good actress for some soap opera, but that's it. Her singing voice is utterly awful and unpleasant (even on CD). She has to sing every song in a low tone so that people think she has a strong voice. I mean a voice does not need to be strong but Halliwell's voice has an awful sound besides. Every single song on &quot;Schizophonic&quot; becomes annoying and a pain in the neck due to Halliwell's weird tones. Hope sympathetic Ms. Halliwell changes her career to TV presenter or TV actress cuz she is not a bad entertainer and that's why I have to give her 2 stars, really only for being sympathetic surely not for her music."
1777,4,"After two Pink Floyd live albums and two live versions of The Wall, did we really need a Roger Waters live album full of Pink Floyd material.  After one listen to this, the answer is yes.  Roger not only offers versions of Floyd standards such as &quot;Money&quot;, &quot;Another Brick In The Wall Pt II&quot;, and &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;, but he gives us more obscure Floyd tracks such as &quot;In The Flesh&quot;, &quot;Mother&quot;, and &quot;Set Your Controls For The Heart Of The Sun&quot;.  Also, &quot;Welcome To The Machine&quot; has never sounded better.  Roger's solo material fits in nicely among the Floyd songs.  If you were lucky enough to catch the &quot;In The Flesh&quot; 1999-2000 tour, this serves as a nice souvenier.  If not, this is a chance  to hear what you missed.   Having also attended the 1987 Radio K.A.O.S. tour, I was hoping he would perform such tracks as &quot;If&quot;, &quot;Nobody's Home&quot;, and &quot;Not Now John&quot; instead of the above mentioned Floyd standards.  Oh well, you can't have everything."
1778,4,"I like dancing to trance music and listening to classical Indian music and was not prepared to hear Drum and Bass with superb classical Indian musicians playing real instruments instead of typical D and B made by one guy with a synth and a sequencer or computer. I thought D and B was over with and didn't expect a new, quality performance. Hey, I love dub, but its not exactly thriving either. Fans of Acid Jazz / jungle / D&amp;B should love this. I'm not, but its great for what it is."
1779,3,"I added this CD to my Christmas list based on the 5 starreviews here at Amazon. ....  Now that I've heard it, I am a little disappointed. <br />Had I heard this CD in 1987, I would have given it 5+ stars. Compared to similar current music and older works by other artists however, this one does not stand out. <br />I have Citizen of the World and Quest of the Dream Warrior. Both are among my all time favorites. I wish I had requested another title for now. I would only recommend this one if you have all of David Arkenstone's CDs and want to complete your collection."
1780,5,This is a fantastic album - pure luiz bonfa.  But all tracks can be found on the compilation &quot;Genios Do Violao - Garoto &amp; Luiz Bonfa&quot;; so that album would receive a higher recommendation from me...
1781,5,"My favorite CD in my collection, but I lost the disc so I have to order a new copy!"
1782,5,"I received this disc as a gift last year and debated whether or not to use it as a coaster. That was until I listened to it. The songs all have one common theme among them, the lonesome cowboy and his trials and tribulations. The groups and singers, like Gene Autry perfectly capture an era that is sadly not even a distant memory to most. I recommend this to anyone that likes to take a divergence once in a while to a musical genre that is so ancient you couldn't even find on Hee Haw anymore."
1783,5,"This recording by Boulez is in my estimation one of the great moments in classical music recorded history. It is one of those performances that I feel has achieved a place with such legendary moments as Karajan's &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; and Walter's Beethoven 6th. Yes, the typical Boulez dissection is there, but what style! The tender moments as well as the terrifying are superbly conveyed by the Viennese and Deutsche Grammaphone's engineering is absolutely flawless. This album is a triumph of this century as far as classical recordings go. Anyone who buys it will not be disappointed."
1784,5,"This is an excellent album.  I was lucky enough to see Coldplay live while living in Oxford about six months before their album was released in Britain, sending them to the top of the UK charts.  If they make it over to the US don't pass up a chance to see them live.  It was a nice surprise to see that their album has been released in the states now too.  If you're a music fan, especially of Radiohead, Jeff Buckley, etc, you'll love Coldplay."
1785,3,"I cannot deny that Apartment 26 has delivered a very interesting debut album. This mix of techno and hard rock is something that is still a very fresh and original sound. However, I don't feel that the songs on this album are up to par w/ the music's unique sound. With the exception of &quot;Backwards,&quot; which is an exceptional song, the songwriting is average. If your interested in taking a listen to some fairly unchartered musical territory, this might be for you. However, I really wouldn't recommend it on any other level."
1786,5,"This album is getting a five from everyone for a reason. This is a beutiful album. It might be one of his best albums. I listened to this album on Nov. 7 over and over again without fast forwarding. Track 18 is the panties dropping song. Anyway, check this album out. I mean it."
1787,5,"This is a wonderful recording that may be enjoyed by all members of the family.  It is one of the few children's recordings that can sustain frequent listenings by adults as well!  The songs, almost all original compositions by Grunsky, are sophisticated and melodic.  Jack does not play down to children.  He gives them what they deserve:  poetic lyrics, music styles from around the world, beautiful arrangements.  &quot;With My Own Two Hands&quot;, is one of the loveliest children's songs I have ever heard.  &quot;Live in Your Imagination&quot;, can also compete with any adult release in terms of listenability and beauty of recording.  A Toronto, Canada publication entitled &quot;City Parent&quot; called &quot;Jumpin Jack&quot;, &quot;one of the best recrdings for children ever made in this country&quot;.  They called Grunsky's new independent release (Fall 2000), &quot;Sing &amp; Dance&quot;, &quot;similarly stellar&quot;.  The person who reviewed this recording previously, could not have listened to &quot;Jumpin' Jack&quot;, as &quot;The Name Game&quot; song to which he refers, is a new composition by Grunsky, and not one of a similar name that this reviewer may have listened to as a child.  My daughter and I love that particular song and sing it repeatedly in the car.  It is lovely!  If you like Indian (sitar) music, you will also love &quot;Water From The Well&quot;."
1788,4,"in my opinion the best of the bosstown sound albums was earth opera's debut which for some reason elektra refuses to put out on cd it seems. the 1st beacon street union album and the first 2 ultimate spinach records are not far behind. its pretentious but intriguing. john lincoln wright is still active in the boston area fronting country bands. the 1st album is as an earlier reviewer said pretty straight ahead rock with touches of blues and r &amp;b here and there. there are some psychedelic flashes and tones however. those expecting some kind of major musical freakout will probably be disappointed, but paul tartachny was a quite talented guitarist, and you'll find some impressive runs on the 1st album. just about every track on the eyes of the beacon street union is solid. the 2nd album is more hit or miss, but the title track and angus of aberdeen are first rate. the former is a somewhat jazzy piece with oblique dylanesque lyrics and the latter features some of tartachny's best guitar work. another excellent song is now i taste the tears which is kind of reminiscent of the rolling stones to some degree, its an r &amp;b type of tune with some fine vocalizing by wright. this is worth picking up if you are a fan of the era or interested in the bosstown sound."
1789,5,This cd is as good as it gets!  Then again Rosemary Clooney always is worth the money!  Keep up the good work!
1790,5,"this album has become one of my favorite joe henry albums, not only for the elegance of the lyrics but also for the brooding darkness lurking in every song. trampoline exudes pain and despair in nearly every track, but escapes oppression with brilliant sounds and instrumentals (who else could use a pump organ, tape loops, electric guitar, operatic soprano AND a barbershop choir and not only escape disaster but end with such intoxicating results?). as others before me have mentioned, &quot;flower girl&quot; is a song of unrivalled beauty and mystery and probably joe henry's  most hypnotic (and confounding) song ever. &quot;parade&quot; and &quot;trampoline&quot; both hint at memories that haunt long after the events that inspired them and even the happier sentiments on the album belie an inevitable isolation. though other reviewers mention a disconnected feel to the album, i think the flow of the songs is wonderful and dreamlike with the perfect balance between despair and reprieve."
1791,5,THE BEST ALBUM I EVER HEARD
1792,2,"Bob Merrill wrote music and/or lyrics for seven musicals.  Four were both artistic and commercial successes (NEW GIRL IN TOWN, TAKE ME ALONG, FUNNY GIRL and his masterpiece, CARNIVAL); one was an artistic flop but a commercial success, SUGAR; and one was an artistic success but only played a limited run, HANNAH 1939 (his last).  Only one was a down and out commercial and artistic disaster and that was HENRY SWEET HENRY.   The time was 1967 and the formula musical comedy was dying a death.  This was typical of the fare  (HAIR was just around the corner).  Why audiences of the 60s loved THE WORLD OF HENRY ORIENT as both book and film, staggers the mind.  They did NOT like it as a musical.  The romantic fantasies of two teenage school girls and their disastrous effects on the attempts of a lecher to score were pretty desperate and dreary story lines to attempt to make sing.  The score is vastly mediocre, far below Merrill's usual output.  Only the title tune, HENRY SWEET HENRY and the rousing POOR LITTLE PERSON have merit in the music and lyrics department.  There is one other, the witty, TO BE ARTISTIC, which scores in the Noel Coward-like dryness of the lyrics.   Fourteen numbers and only three make it to the front.   This does not even have the curio aspect that makes a flop camp.  Odd little piece and not really recommended."
1793,5,"You can tell from my handle that I'm one of those old dudes who are always bragging about buying the first Grateful Dead album in college when it came out, and blathering on about Jimmy and Janis and how true rock and roll died on the back of a Harley Davidson outside Macon, GA in 1972.  At least until the latest generation of rockers came along and firmly established themselves as The Real Deal. During the 80's rock had plumbed the depths until the likes of Blues Traveler, Dave Matthews, Gin Blossoms, the Cranberries, etc., etc., etc. put the punch back in without bangin' the head out, as it were.    Sheryl Crow is very definitely among that number.  And SC and Friends is the best collection of live R&amp;R since the Allman Brothers recorded &quot;Live At the Fillmore East&quot;.  To begin with, the production is impeccable and the band hot-hot-hot.  Did you notice how well they covered and fleshed out the original arrangements of Gold Dust Woman, Happy and White Room?  And surprise:  all of Crow's songs rock like they never did on the airplay versions.  Strong Enough would be a C&amp;W crossover hit in a heartbeat, The Difficult Kind a Top 40 biggie as well, were they released as singles.  This album has great sound, superior arrangements, a new Crow tune, lots of (mostly) exceptional stars, an R&amp;R curiosity (Keith Richard singing! Don't quit your day job, Keith.), and even an archaic Dylan track, sounding just like Al Kooper and Mike Bloomfield were up on the stage with them.  What is it you one-stars don't like?"
1794,5,"Quite Possibly the best Iron Maiden album ever made, Bruce's debut album is a rip-roaring, rock and roll landmark. This album more or less defined what is though of as the best period in Iron Maiden's history. The abbum itself has so many classics, the Prisinor is a full on rock anthem complete with sing along chorus ans is my personal favourite Run to the Hills. The title track and Hallowed Be Thy Name are also outstanding slabs of metallic genius, showing how powerful classic Maiden were. To any fans of Maiden or Rock music generally who don't own this album, buy it, its a classic."
1795,4,"This is quite an unusual album for Western listeners - American pop/jazz/soul singer Roberta Flack does an album of covers of a well known Japanese artist. Flack sings the lyrics in English but the songs, both lyrically and musically, sound very &quot;Japanese pop&quot;. The chord progressions are typically western-influenced Japanese pop and the songs are occasionally unintentionally amusing unless you listen with an awareness that it's translated material. Nevertheless there are some very appealing cuts here - &quot;Flower&quot; and &quot;New York&quot; are standouts. This album will appeal to Flack completists (recorded in 1999 and never released outside of Japan) but the uninitiated listener may find little of interest."
1796,5,"Con Funk Shun is one of my favorite r&amp;b/quiet storm groups of the 1970's.  At one time I had ALL of their albums.  I think that the albums &quot;Spirit of Love&quot;, &quot;Touch&quot;, and &quot;7&quot; were their very best &quot;total package&quot; efforts.  I would like to obtain a copy of &quot;7&quot;, &quot;Candy&quot; and &quot;Loveshine&quot; again (hint for anyone who can help with a cassette tape copy).<br />Anyway, this live recording contains a good sample of Con Funk Shun's best material.  The new members of the group don't miss a beat.  I am curious as to what happened to the other original members: Cedric Martin/bass, Louis McCall/drums and Danny Tho mas/keyboards.  I had the pleasure of meeting Cedric Martin after a concert in Cleveland, Ohio in @1978.  There is nothing so great as live horns and this album has plenty of that in the Ffun intro segueing into Chase Me.  The bass is booming and popping with Michael Cooper and Felton &quot;Clyde&quot; Pilate still doing great justice on vocals.<br />There are many, many jams that they could have done on this cd but the representation is good.  Personaly, I like Candy, Got to Be Enough, Touch, Body Lovers, Ms. Got-the-body and Do Ya.  But these guys do a super job of mixing it up between fast jams and ballads.<br />The slow jams are awesome!!!  Let Me Put Love on Your Mind and Love's Train are mega-BEGGING songs and I was very pleased to see Straight From the Heart on this list... it is a very beatiful song and reminds me of my youngest daughter who died tragically 10 years ago at the age of 8.5 months. I use this song to express the love of a father to his young daughter... with all the hopes and dreams we all have for our children... only to see them sadly dashed away.   Probably not the original intent of the song, but it works for me.  I'm Leaving Baby and Baby, I'm Hooked are good choices too, but I would like to have heard Honey Wild, Make It Last, Can't Say Goodbye, Give You love To Me or theirfirst slow jam Another World.<br />The inclusion of By Your Side with the instrumental solos and introductions of the band members is a brief taste of the true musicianship these guys had during the 70's.  Remember Indian Summer Love, California 1, Foley Park, If You're In Need, and Play Widit?<br />Of course, they HAD to end the live segment of the cd with Ffun appropriately.  Throw It Up is a nice take on George &quot;Dukey Stick&quot; Duke's popular Reach for It.  The mega-mix could have been left off the cd as far as I'm concerned because when you start to listen to it, it sounds so good you want to skip back  and hear the entire song again not just small clips!!!<br />I'd love to see this band live again, but since I live in New England now and these guys are California bred, that seems like a very remote possibility.  In the meantime, I'm glad to hear that they have gotten back together and are doing some shows.<br />Wow... the 1970's sure produced a lot of enjoyable, clean r&amp;b to listen and dance to.   This is a refreshing taste worthy to be added to any collection."
1797,5,"Didier Malherbe, the outstanding sax player in Gong, presents us with a collection of wind instrument tunes, but these melodies are coloured with ethnic variegations.  Someimes even like circs or street market music from the mystickal East.  An instrumental album that will appeal to PHP's, it would als appeal to visiting parents and relatives...simply put, an album of marvellous simplicity coloured with infinitea.  Not something to rock out to, but something to enjoy a nice fireside and some realitea with, on a cold dark night.  Very nice indeed."
1798,5,"Though The Cult have reformed with a spectacular lineup and have Bob Rock on the dials again, there is no way that they could ever live up to what they gave us here.  This cd has never left my side.  It's as powerful as any of their previous releases and more emotional than anything in years.  It rock's, grooves and soothes.  Unfortunately they no longer play any of it live.<br />This cd is to metal what U2's Achtung Baby was to rock.  This cd was overlooked and will never make the impact that it could have with a proper label promotion.<br />Ian has never sounded better and Billy's riffs were cut short but very sweet.  This cd has made Cult fans out the biggest skeptics.  Do yourself a favor, forget what is new and hyped and buy this gem.  You will not be sorry."
1799,5,"\\""Pictures At An Exhibition\\"" was played on ELP's official debut on August 29, 1970, at the Isle of Wight Festival. From that time to this Newcastle City Hall live recording of March 26, 1971, the growth was just amazing. This Mussorgsky piece is one of the most played on ELP's career, and an indicative of the artistic moment of the group. Hence, at Isle of Wight or the December 9 1970 performance at the Lyceum Theatre, you feel through it that ELP members are still getting along, sometimes overly fascinated with some effects (synths, improvisation or jokes). On the other hand, in 1977, during the Works tour, you have a tremendous richness of sound in a (unfortunately) reduced version, perhaps too much richness for the bizarre (in the best sense of the word) Mussorgsky world. Their 90's versions of it are somehow boring, slow, and tone lowered because of Lake's deeping voice (the key transposition after Palmer' amazing solo was painful), exciting only for the historical partnership between group and the piece.<br />All this to say that, thinking about the registrations of performances of \\""Pictures\\"" by ELP, this one is certainly the best. I think \\""Pictures\\"" is the most dangerous risk of excess for the group, sometimes too much Hammond destruction, sometimes too much Moog or ribbon controller, and during the 90's too much midi doubling. But here, ELP was able not to fall in temptation to make moments last more than they should, or to overweight them, making unrepeatable music. Because of that, you have the perfect timing for Moog solos, wild Hammonds, crazy drums and Lake's vocal, softer than in any other record, but aggreessive sometimes. It's unforgettable the synth lines and sounds during \\""The Gnome\\"", or during the second \\""Promenade\\"". \\""The Sage\\"" shows Lake's poetry of the early 70's, not easily achieved later, just a guitar with metal strings and voice - a minstrel among two medieval dragons. It's wonderful to see the peaceful features of the audience during this song on the video of the Lyceum performance. The first \\""Promenade\\"", more than ever, is really affecting - solemnly rock and roll. \\""The Hut of Baba Yaga\\""is one of most tense moments in rock history, and about it, I should say that the \\""Manticore\\"" video version (1973) is still more dramatic because of monstrous Carl Palmer's sonority. The third \\""Promenade\\"" makes a furious return that the original piano version didn't show - again ELP's arrangement powers. The first CD release (Atlantic/Cotillion) had fade out and fade in at the time of turning sides of original vinyl, but later CD releases fixed it. The art cover is wonderful, and conceptual (note that the ground of \\""The Hut Of Baba Yaga\\"" inner picture has the same style of the \\""Tarkus\\"" art cover). The last track, independent from \\""Pictures\\"", is \\""Nutrocker\\"", ELP's cheerful music with wonderful clavinet parts.<br />\\""Pictures At An Exhibition\\"" is the wildest ELP record."
1800,5,"Radiohead is without a doubt the most incredible rock band on the planet right now.  Already having laid claim to that title with the incredible OK Computer, the band has cemented their status by making Kid A, which is not a rock album at all.  At least, not a rock album like any you've ever heard.  It may be foolish to try and review an album like this after only having owned it for seven hours, but I'll give it a try.      For starters, if you want to hear another album that sounds like OK Computer or The Bends, you're going to be very disappointed with this one.  The only track that comes close to the band's previous sound is the epic ballad How to Disappear Completely, and even that is only due to the strumming accoustic guitar.  The biggest change in the band's sound is that they no longer sound like a guitar band using keyboards as occasional guests; here the guitars sound like guests.  In their place are an army of keyboards, electronic beats, and weird mutations of Thom Yorke's vocals.  The first two tracks, Everything in its Right Place and the title track, are almost completely built upon the above three elements.  The National Anthem is the album's first track that shows much rock influence at all, built upon Colin Greenwood's relentless fuzz bass groove before collapsing under the weight of a discordant jazz horn section.  Following the hypnotic How to Disappear... is Treefingers, a four minute long collage of keyboard sounds that is actually really beautiful in a strange way.  Optimistic, the most &quot;rock&quot; song on the album, follows, based on almost tribal drum rhythms and the closest thing here to a catchy chorus, with Thom singing &quot;The best you can/ the best you can is good enough&quot; in his trademark falsetto.  That song flows seamlessly into In Limbo, a very dense creation with some rare, tricky-timed guitar. Idioteque is almost straight techno, and it is the least &quot;Radiohead-sounding&quot; track on the album, other than the lyrics, which I think are about the pre-Y2K fuss the media cooked up: &quot;Who's in a bunker?...Ice age coming...We're not scaremongering/ This is really happening.&quot;  Morning Bell is based on Phil Selway's most complex drumming on the album, and is more oppressive strangeness.  Motion Picture Soundtrack is next, and it continues the Radiohead tradition of closing their albums with a sense of grandeur approaching awe (eg. Blow Out, Street Spirit, The Tourist).  I can't think of another musical artist that would be able to pull this off without sounding ridiculous.  It's nothing less than an aural representation of what it must sound like to drift up into heaven.  Seriously.  Other than Yorke's vocals, the only instrumentation is organ and cascading harps.  It just kind of leaves you stunned at the album's conclusion.       I've listened to the album twice all the way through already, and so far the only songs I haven't really warmed up to are Everything..., Kid A, and Idioteque (the more or less straight electronica songs).  But you can't judge Radiohead's music that quickly; it took me five months to truly appreciate how great Exit Music was on OKC.  I'm sure those three songs will grow on me.  The only main complaint about the album is that there is not a single Jonny Greenwood guitar solo, which means that Kid A kind of lacks the comparitive earthiness present on the first three albums.  But that is a small price to pay, and I can already tell that this album, like OK Computer, will prove to be endlessly rewarding in the long run.  It is simply the most stunningly inventive album I've ever heard from a major rock band.<br />P.S. Sorry if I got a little verbose, but hey, it's Radiohead!"
1801,4,"The 1960s was when the self-contained rock band first became the norm. Bands that wrote their own songs and played their own instruments were still uncommon, but it was quite clear that there was more talent coming from the musicians themselves than the producers creating a &quot;sound&quot; for them. The Who wasn't exactly a group of this kind, relying mostly on Pete Townshend's prodigious talent for songwriting. But with a lucrative royalty deal put under their noses, the other members of the Who couldn't resist grabbing on to it, and tried their best to become songwriters on their second album A QUICK ONE. As expected, Pete's songs were the best, with bassist John Entwhistle's a close second. As for Roger Daltrey and Keith Moon, they were nice tries, but nothing special. At the time, The Who were still one of the loudest, rawest rock groups around and songs like &quot;Run Run Run&quot;, &quot;So Sad About Us&quot;, and their first &quot;rock opera&quot; &quot;A Quick One While He's Away&quot; are some of Pete's best songs when long-form works had not yet entered his conscience. The perfect songs for playing guitars as well as smashing them. A QUICK ONE was the first time John Entwhistle got to really demonstrate his songwriting muscle. While he wasn't as accomplished as Pete, he certainly wasn't any worse. &quot;Whiskey Man&quot; and &quot;Boris The Spider&quot; are all typical of Entwhistle's, and The Who's, demented sense of humor. John may not have smashed his guitar, but he could be wild when it came to humor. In the end, the democracy of songwriting on A QUICK ONE only may have resulted in some fat royalty checks, but it was a gallant effort at trying to show that Pete may have been the main songwriting voice of the Who, but he wasn't the only one. In the end, each member of the Who would get their day in the solo sun. A QUICK ONE showed the potential each member had at acheiving this."
1802,2,"I think folks need to finally realize that the continuing sales performance of this record is largely due to peer pressure.  At some point it just became &quot;hip&quot; to own it, like a lava lamp, or rubik's cube.  Unfortunately, for the world, this isn't a fad like the two aforementioned items."
1803,5,"The Soul Brothers had been producing hits in South Africa for twenty years  before they brought out this album, and this shows in the measured  composure of their sound. Their compositions are based on an infectious  formula which they tend to stick to, but that doesn't take anything away  from the appeal of the album. What stands out is the original use of the  Hammond organ by Moses Ngwenya, and perhaps one of the mellowist horn  sections on the continent (Thomas Phale &amp; Javas Magubane). Mix these  with a driving bass and rippling guitar lines to underpin the harmonious  vocals and its easy to see why they're such an enduring favourite in the  townships. Check out AMAPHUTHA (track 5), to sample the exquisite poise of  this soulful group.

1805,4,"This little collection has a few real gems on it, however, there's also  quite a bit of stuff that could have been left off.  There is some demo  material and some live tracks that lack luster, although they do provide a  little insight into the band and give a slight glimpse of their live sound.   There are a few tracks which really stand out well - it validates the  purchase of the CD - especially if you're already a fan of I.G. or S.T.  If  this is your first experience with I.G., I would strongly recommend their  first &quot;The Plague That Makes Your Booty Move&quot; CD - this will have  a greater impact than this CD or the one that followed this one. Sarsippius  III returns to narrate this CD, instead of simply annoying security in  their first release.  This band rocks - the guitarist is phenomenal - bass  is unbelievable - drummer is very enthusiastic.  Awesome!"
1806,4,"I like the sound of this cd, as far as I've heard. I easily prefer  Varttina and Garmarna, but this looks like a good group to add to the  colection. Besides, anything with Tuvan throat singing is OK by me..."
1807,1,"I had to listen to this cd 3 times over,and i don't wish that upon anybody  ever.But the worst songs on here are KC and the sunshine band's  &quot;Getdown Tonight&quot;and &quot;Disco Inferno&quot;.All of the Legion  people liked it,but i didn't."
1808,5,Robert Lee Castleman is truly a great find for anyone wanting to hear a  different sound.  He is backed by some of the best musicians alive.  Great  songs and great production.  I hope we can hear more from this talented  artist.
1809,5,"Without a doubt, these guys are masters of some of the best death metal  ever played on the planet.  Devious Instinct and Fatal Millennium being two  of my favs.  Others have tried to imitate the Monstrosity music, but have  failed....they'll never measure up to the killer sound of Monstrosity. The  only album better than this one is Monstrosity's new album &quot;In Dark  Purity&quot;."
1810,4,"Animals is a very well done record from the best rock band ever. A few  loose ends hurt it, but all of the songs are excellent. I'm getting very  used to the five-song CDs that Pink Floyd have made, with their overlong  tracks and very provocative meanings. Animals is similar. The first and  last songs on the album (Pigs on the Wing 1 &amp; 2) are good ways to begin  and end it. Then we have Dogs, arguably the best song on the album. This  song is one of my favorites because it combines David Gilmour's great  guitar playing with Roger Waters' poetic lyrics. Pigs and Sheep are also  well done, but nowhere near as good as Dogs. Pigs and Sheep all suffer from  the same problems. They both lack the musical influence of David Gilmour,  who wrote some of the best Floyd music ever. Animals is not by any means a  bad album but it's not an excellent one. It is a must-buy for a Floyd fan."
1811,4,"AC/DC certainly started the 1990s with a bang. Too bad it took them a  decade to pick up where this one left off (with &quot;Stiff Upper  Lip&quot;). You have to admire a band which for the most part has kept it  no frills all these years. You can carp if you want about how little if any  they've changed, but there is something to be said for that kind of thing  in more ways than one. Some dare call it consistency. Especially when they  take it to a live performance arena."
1812,5,"If only as a point of reference about post-Hendrix guitar, you should get  &quot;Trippin'&quot;. &quot;Love Crime&quot; &quot;Garden of Love&quot;  &quot;Stranger&quot; and the title cut sear with great writing, inspired  singing and killer, I repeat KILLER GUITAR work. I went to see Jean-Paul  everywhere he played in NYC in 91 &amp; 92 just for &quot;LoveCrime&quot;  alone. If you love Vernon, swear by BB, Albert &amp; Freddy  and realise  that this is another of the great Miles Davis sidemen. Get a copy of this  CD."
1813,5,"I have to agree with one of the other reviewers..this is not Ella's best album.  But compared to all the tired Ella wannabes out there singing  today, this is pure pleasure.<br />At an age when most divas have to retire  because they have nothing left, Ms. Fitz gives a birthday party that shows  again why she is &quot;the greatest singer in the world&quot;.<br />If there  is such a thing as a weak cut on this album, it would have to be  &quot;Caravan&quot;. Her rendition of &quot;I Can't Give You Anything but  Love&quot; could only be better if she had had &quot;Pops&quot; Armstrong  with her to sing it.<br />If you have no album in your collection from the  divine Ms. F I suggest you start here."
1814,5,"This is one of the most interesting new Jazz albums I have heard. Firmly  grounded in the Steve Coleman style, Vijay Iyer and this group of musicians  has somehow managed to take things even one step further. A must have."
1815,5,I really  like this movie and the music is  so beautiful that  its so much  to the ears then it is to the heart i think  John Williams  did a GREAT job  with this score its  so cool. as a musician  my self its  so much more then   music  its telling a story of a life and a world that was living some time  ago .
1816,5,"This is my ABSOLUTE favorite Gary P. recording &amp; I have been a fan since the Jerry Jeff Walker days.  The music is perfect for 2-step, swing and waltz, and the lyrics evoke sentimental memories of riding in the  pick-up with granddad, and fond memories of cooking chili on the cooker in  the backyard.  My daughter started learning Spanish from &quot;Gracias Por  Esse&quot;.  If you have ever set foot in Texas, you can't help but love  this.  The boy from Brownfield is the insufficiently appreciated &quot;poet  lariet&quot; of the honky tonks."
1817,4,"I just purchased Azusa 3 a couple weeks ago. I listen to it everyday and I really enjoy it. My favorites are Peace in the Valley with Sis. Mangun (What an awesome lady! I've heard her speak and sing on a number of  occasions. She is truly anointed.), Just a Closer Walk With Thee (I can't  seem to get that one out of my head), and Jesus be a Fence (Fred Hammond is  always awesome.) My only complaint is I wish there were more of the song on  the first track. (Come on Children, Let's Sing/He's All Right.) I love it!  Perhaps Carlton Pearson has it on a previous Azusa CD and I'm just not  aware of it yet. Overall, a truly great CD. A must have for your gospel  music collection."
1818,2,"Sorry I bought this CD.  &quot;America&quot; is just another Altissimo compilation of recordings that may be obtained directly from the armed  services for free. Through a quirk in the law the armed services are  prohibited from selling CDs to the public.  But that same law allows  anybody (including Altissimo) to reassemble these otherwise free recordings  and sell them to the public.  The performers are great - but the quality of  the recordings are inconsistent, the number of selections is paltry and the  arrangements do not really work together on the CD.  I have learned from  speaking to some of the performers here in DC, that all of this is due in  part to the fact that the recordings were never intended by the military to  be part of a commercial CD.  Many other recordings are better:  Robert  Shaw's &quot;Battle Cry of Freedom&quot;; the Washington Men's Camerata's  &quot;Spirit of Freedom&quot; and the Morman Tabernacle Choir's &quot;God  Bless America&quot; (although the Morman Tabernacle's recording is a bit  operatic for patriotic music).  In any event, I doubt this CD will satisfy  you - so try some others."
1819,5,"going back to the good old days of oasis, this album is simply amazing, with each song having hit potential."
1820,4,"This is music best listened to in the car, driving down an empty back road with the windows or the top down.  This album is a joy to listen to from start to finish.  The upbeat and slow tracks are well placed in the track  arrangement, allowing both blues musicians to take the listener on a  wonderful ride.  The music has a great soundstage, with Clapton's vocals  and guitars feeding out the left channel, and B.B.'s contributions playing  out the right channel.  The effect is enhanced in a car, with bass guitars  and drums coming from the rear speakers, and the vocals and guitars up  front.  B.B. King steals the show on the album, particularly on &quot;10  years,&quot; a track about the King's former lover, and &quot;3 a.m.,&quot;  which features an extended jam session from both Clapton and King.  Any  music fan will relish the chance to hear these two greats play such  wonderful music together."
1821,5,This CD is so cool. When I first got this CD I couldn't stop listening to it. I never got tired of it and Im not tired of it yet. The lyrics on this album are ok but thats Eminem's life and how he feels. Thats better then  him goin out and actually doin the stuff he says on tha album. He is just  givin his opinion on the world and stuff. This CD has some phat beats. If u  are offended easily by lyrics I suggest u get the edited version of this  CD.
1822,5,"Everyone is complaining about the fact that there were no bonus tracks included on the 1999 EMI re-issues of all of David's old cds. We would all love to have the rare bonus tracks that were included on the Rykodisc  re-issues in 1991, but that's not what I should be talking about.  &quot;Heroes&quot; (the album) is not as good as Low, but it's more  substantial than Lodger. Brian Eno's prescence is very noticeable. The  instrumentals are especially good (with the exception of &quot;Sense of  Doubt&quot;). This cd shows just how much potential two musical geniuses  working on one album really have."
1823,5,"Cool Nutz with the help of producer/lyricist Bosko put together a compilation of the best of the northwest for this album.  If you live in the west, or listen to the west coast, purchase this double disk, it wont  ever leave your rotation.   Wit cuts featuring Lifesavas, G-ism, Jumbo,  Pete Miser, Bosko, Grass Rootz, Maniac, and the portland legend Cool Nutz  himself, the chance of disapointment are Bleek, who is also featured on the  album.  So dont wait, purchase this."
1824,5,"This album is truely astounding, it makes no sense.  The songs are very plain and simple and very repetitive, and it seems that the band have never rehearsed any of the material on the album.  But something drags you in and  makes you keep on listening.<br />The voice and perhaps the way it is  repetitive seems the grab hold of you.  <br />This isnt normally my sort of  music, but i have listened to this so many times, its excellent and i dont  know why.<br />The whole thing is magical, which it has to be.  I think you  will either love the simplicity or loathe it, but well worth a listen to."
1825,5,"Shawn Mullins is one of the most intensely talented artist I have ever heard or seen.  He has amazing talent and an incredible voice.  The First Ten Years truly showcases all of Shawn's finer aspects.  It accurately  portrays the changes he has gone throuh as a recording artist as well as  giving the listener the opportunity to sample some of Shawn's earlier  works.  The songs on this album are suberbly crafted and are, each in their  own way, very touching.  What is Life shows Shawn's upbeat and cheerful  side, while Just Like Me reveals his serious and introspective side.  Shawn  as an artist encompasses many of the emotions that we as listeners feel on  an everyday basis, and this compilation of his works will take the listener  through each and every emotion.  It is uplifting and heart-warming while  still being fun, exciting, and at times sad and questioning.  It is a great  album and the kind that you can sit down and listen to the whole thing.  I  love it, and I'm sure that anyone who hears will as well.  If you are a  Shawn Mullins fan, or even if you are not, you will have such a great  experience with this album, that you will want to go out and buy all the  rest of his.  This album truly showcases all the different talents and  abillities that make up Shawn Mullins as a recording artist."
1826,4,This album magically impressed me by the clarity of the lyrics and the deep sensual drums. A must listen to for those who are not impressed with rock
1827,4,"Zeretzke's music is powerful, and this work pushes the edges of sound.  Beginning with &quot;Ray One&quot;, the instrumentation is tight and well-formed, with varying intensities, depicting the growth of the music in  relation to a specific star.  The final selection &quot;Tenmile!&quot; from  &quot;Utah Compositions&quot;  is richly composed and executed.  The  ominous oboe aids in creating the beautifully cast vision of the slickrock  canyon.  This is a must have for anyone who loves world music, precision  and intensity!"
1828,5,"This Cd is the best i've ever lisented, it has new and old songs, what are you waiting? BUY IT NOW!"
1829,3,"Just bought this CD, and I must say I'm impressed with Mr. Negron's vocal range throughout this CD. Not only does he cover some of the old Three Dog Night stuff, but he includes new originals as well, and he does it with a  flair and style all his own! I also think including his children in some  tracks is a nice, personal touch, which adds a unique, robust flavor here.  The only song I don't care for is the 'discofied' version of &quot;Joy To  The World.&quot; I commend Chuck on getting his message across and for  sharing his personal story with us. This is a must-have CD for all hardcore  TDN fans and for those facing personal issues in their life. I highly  recommend reading the book &quot;Three Dog Nightmare&quot;, which is an  accompaniment to the CD. Good work, Chuck!"
1830,5,"Proof, if it is needed, that the Pet Shop Boys were on the finest and most under-rated pop bands ever, this compiles singles from 'West End Girls' up until and shortly after the 'Behaviour' era (sadly, this collection  includes nothing from 'Very'). Along with New Order and the Smiths, the Pet  Shop Boys were one of a handful of unconventional, quintessentially English  indie pop acts from the '80s, although, uniquely, the Pet Shop Boys were  commercially massive, with four number one hits to date. They always seemed  to be mocking themselves, and mocking the idea of being a pop group, whilst  at the same time Neil Tennant sang lyrics that seemed, under the gloss, to  be totally sincere, emotional tales of love and loss. On 'Being Boring',  'It's Alright' and 'So Hard' they ditched the irony altogether, although by  this time everybody assumed that they did not mean what they were singing.  Still, the though of the Pet Shop Boys covering U2 is very, very  arch.<br />'Discography' is excellent - a collection of virtually all the  a-sides they released until 1992, it's a model of how to do a compilation.  The Tennant-penned sleevenotes are both informative and gently self-mocking  (take that, Paul Morley), and with 18 tracks you get a lot of music for  your money. If you also buy 'Alternative', their almost-equally interesting  b-sides collection, you have the equivalent of New Order's excellent  'Substance 1987'."
1831,4,"This the blues plain and simple. In a day and age of wannabes and phonies, its nice to hear the sound of the real blues still shines forth.The harmonica tone on this album is real serious,Heavy-duty! Bell runs the  whole Gamut of blues from Funk to chicken-picking. Its well-worth your  money and time. Long Live The Delta Blues!"
1832,5,"Excellent cover songs by some of today's best artists. Rumours is one of the greatest albums of all time and it is about time that younger artists paid tribute.  The covers by both Matchbox 20 and the Corrs are  exceptional. If you love Fleetwood Mac and want to hear a different take on  your favorite song, this is the tribute album for you."
1833,5,"This is the best verison of Carnival I have heard.  Classic Wynton also provides a fantastic interpretation on the most difficult trumpet solo of all time.  But Schwarz shows amazing control, fantastic percision, and  baffling dexterity.  The Debutante and the Bride, etc. are also impressive.  Its a shame Schwarz gave up trumpet to conduct.  Having played these songs  myself, I definitely recommend it to any classical trumpet  enthusiast/student"
1834,5,"The Brothers Four were my favorite folk group of the 1960s. I have several records and tapes of their original music but this CD is better, if that's at all possible, than the originals. The sound is so deep it almost shocks  you back into the '60s. The first song on the CD, Greenfields, is the one  most often associated with this  fantastic group, and it's done so well it  stops you in your tracks. Shenandoah,  Green Leaves of Summer, Scotch and  Soda, Where Have All the Flowers Gone, and Lady Greensleeves are so mellow  and smooth - completely familiar in every way. I don't remember them  singing San Francisco Bay Blues (I have that song by Peter, Paul, and Mary  and love it, but back then songs were often recorded by several different  artists). The Brothers Four rendition of San Francisco Bay Blues is now one  of my favorite songs. A wonderful wonderful CD.  I loved their music on my  scratchy little record player of 35 years ago but I love it more on a  high-quality sound system of today. If you were once a Brothers Four fan  and wonder where they are today - they can be found in this CD - and you'll  feel young again, too!"
1835,5,"The Wild Party is a deliciously decadent and tragic depiction of a postmodern Manhattan in the 1920's.  It is, quite frankly, the jazziest, hippest and coolest musical currently on Broadway.  <br />Mandy Patinkin, as  the sometimes over-the-top Burrs, is right back where he belongs - center  stage.  Eartha Kitt is purrr-fectly wonderful as Dolores Montoya and Toni  Collette is simply astonishing as Queenie.  <br />La Chiusa has struck gold  with what to me is the most mature, daring, and bold production of his  career.  The Wild Party CD is a marvelous top-notch cast recording of a  brilliant new musical production by one of Broadway's brightest new  talents.  This is one Broadway show not to be missed!"
1836,4,"The reigning goth-metal kings finally put out a new album! And naturally it is really good, though no where near as engaging as their previous offering OCTOBER RUST, but solid and entertaining nonetheless.<br />This one  is more of a throw back to the near concept style of BLOODY KISSES. This  time following the long fall of someone who has chosen to commit suicide by  overdose. In between songs there are short interludes that play out the  action, culminating in the hospital flat line.<br />The songs themselves are  harder in nature than the last album, with more heavy metal riffing, and  aggressive guitar playing. There is still the prerequisite gothic ballad  (PYRETA BLAZE, which incidentally is the album's stand out track), but most  of this is harder edged musings on death and the souring effect it has on  the loved ones. Pretty heavy stuff, but as usual the tongue is firmly in  cheek most of the way through, making the dark subject matter  palatable.<br />The only misstep is the BEATLES medley the closes out the  album. Not that it is bad, just inconsistent with the rest of the material.  Though I suppose it offers a nice respite after all of the gloom that has  come before."
1837,5,"Jim Oliver is unique among &quot;New Age&quot; musicians. His pieces unfold over a half hour or more, an unbroken flow of layered shifting tones that create a joyous, peaceful feeling of flow.  Musicians will find his  themes and chordal changes fascinating as is the way he uses a wide and  creative range of synthesized tones. This is no tired rehash of world music  sounds as is so much other new age schlock. <br />Since buying it first in the  early 1990s on tape I've worn out this recording and came here to buy the  CD."
1838,5,"Working at a radio station and recieving NOK's album a little earlier than others, I felt lucky to here these guys before other people did (as music director of the station, i charted them on CMJ). If you are into loud rock and heavy music, please take effort in buying this CD. And do take in mind  that I am a tough critic-paul...."
1839,5,"Prince, perhaps the greatest synthesizer of modern rock music styles, shows off his command of jazz, blues, and funk in this ebullient collection of previously unreleased cuts recorded (for WB) between the mid-80's and  90's.<br /> It gets off to a rollicking start in \\""The Rest of My Life,\\"" a  superb song with funk galore and horns so tight you'll be thinking James  Brown's Flames!  While I wish the lyric weren't so trite, the production is  superb.  When Prince commands \\""let's go!\\"" the band swings into full gear,  with funky sax and a driving rhythm section. The second song, It's About  That Walk, is in the same mode (except for Prince's trademark falsetto,  very effective here) punctuated by organ, and, again, those fabulous horns!   He builds up the drums/guitars into a soul-shaking crescendo (\\""...have  mercy\\"")- pays tribute to his predecessors (\\""remember that ending?\\"" he asks)  and gets away with a showmanship worthy of you-know-who. How many others  can do James Brown this good?<br />Prince's melodic talent is evident on both  \\""She Spoke 2 Me\\"" and \\""Extraordinary,\\"" a vintage Prince ballad-smooth and  falsettoed-complemented by tasty guitar and piano accents.  But the former  song (\\""She Spoke...\\"") is the revelation here...  as jazz-influenced as anything  I've heard from him, brimming with excellent guitar work and good comping  by the rhythm section.  Listen closely and you'll hear shades of John  Coltrane, Ornette Coleman and Miles Davis on the breaks.  Brilliant! Give  credit to the horn players: Michael Nelson, Brian Gallagher, Steve Strand,  and Kathy and Jensen, with arrangements by Michael Nelson and Prince.<br />\\""5  Women+\\"" is Robert Cray-style blues, with Cray's strong narratives and B.B.  King riffs laid down just right, enhanced by muted trumpet for added  poignancy.   \\""When the Lights Go Down\\"" masterfully uses percussion and  piano for a soft, relaxing groove.   The only failure on the CD is \\""My  Little Pill,\\"" which is mercifully short. <br />The restof the songs are  outstanding, with special attention due \\""Sarah\\"" - a total rocker that  recalls Little Richard, 70's funk, and (yes) James Brown.  Exuberant, it's  total head-rocking, danceable joy (and Prince is one of the few who can  manage a convincing \\""watch out!\\"").   I strongly recommend this album to  Prince fans, which must now expand to include jazz, funk and R&amp;B  followers as well!"
1840,5,"This disk blends traditional Scottish folk sounds with a new element: bursts of energy, sometimes popping up at unexpected times. A mix of slow, emotional ballads and up-tempo tunes for jigs. Original compositions with  strong melodies and great improvisation, played to perfection. Absolutely  wonderful music (even for people who don't usually much like violin); the  recording has a very warm sound."
1841,5,The entire cd just blows me away! Acoustic guitar can't be beat on &quot;The Place Where I Come From.&quot; Love &quot;High Flying Rocket&quot;. This is blues at its best!
1842,5,"The Jayhawks Blue Earth record is a one of a kind! Or maybe two of a kind if you count their very first self titled album which is no longer available (OOP). This one is still available, and I strongly suggest buying it before it's not available anymore! It's on the very small Twin-tone  label. One listen to this gem, and you'll understand where the Jayhawks  came from. The pre-big label Jayhawks doing what they do best, and that's  defining what good down home Americana music is all about. Talk about  musical &quot;hooks&quot;! I dare you to try and count them on Blue Earth.  The songwriting team of Olsen/Louris has never sounded better. These songs  will stick in your head for years to come. Although I'm a fan of all the  Jayhawks material, Blue Earth has always been my sentimental favorite  because the songs are so real and unpolished. By that I mean, this album  doesn't have all the glitter that some studio albums have. This sounds more  like the guys got together in a studio and played the album straight  through live, while having a great time doing it! Do yourself a big favor  and pick this one up, then you'll understand where all the other great  Alt-country bands came from. Remember, before Uncle Tupelo, there was the  Jayhawks!"
1843,4,"This is a good CD. It's good because it's not the simplistic melodramatic pop music that's overplayed on the radio. I think it's appeal is the use of so many different intruments. It's got a Dave Matthews feel to it, yet the  two groups are completely opposite in many respects. I would say that this  music is something to be experienced, rather than just listened to, because  it's more of a musical portrayal of life, rather than just music and words."
1844,5,"I have been listening to this recording since the late 70's. Done in 1975 it is way, way ahead of its time. It is a classic."
1845,5,"Gosh, this CD is great. Annie is a classic even though at the age of 18 I still like the movie and the CD. The broadway version looks kind of dumb, but the original Annie is better because it's the way it meant to be. My  favorite song is &quot;It's a Hard Knock Life&quot;. Ya'll have to buy this  CD and the movie because there both great."
1846,5,"This album is vicious, relentless and incredibly catchy.  It moves away from the artier Zen Arcade (recorded a mere 5 months earlier!) by turning  that album's experiments and sprawling concept into individual super  charged songs.  The production is better than ZA - obviously not all first  take, but the drums get the crash they deserve and the guitar is a  wave-of-noise treble attack.<br />Also, this album's songwriting moves away  from hardcore screamfests into songs more influenced by 60's pop melodicism  delivered with the same rage and power as their hardcore material.  This  only serves to strengthen the  songs Hart and Mould turn in.  The songs are  brutal and fast, the choruses (improved by the gorgeous voices of both  Mould and Hart) are almost always catchy and memorable.<br />The title track  kicks off the record with a moment of drum power and then a wall of sheer  guitar rage backed by 3 Bob Moulds and 2 Grant Harts screaming &quot;New  Day Rising&quot; at each other over and over.  Hart's &quot;The Girl Who  Lives On Heaven Hill&quot; even manages to top that astonishing moment with  a crushing, melodic chorus and quirky, memorable lyrics (&quot;she's got a  big room and it's always a mess / her worn-out shoes and a worn-out  dress&quot;) about a boy obsessed with a lonely sweet-hearted girl.   Following that, Mould turns in the amazing &quot;Celebrated Summer,&quot;  which is the best song on the record, and in many ways its centerpiece.   Structurally complex, with changes indebted to folk (it even has an  acoustic bridge), this song about lost innocence still requires maximum  volume because of the screamed, beautiful vocals and the overwhelming  guitar.  Opening side 2, Hart gives out an incredibly catchy song called  &quot;Terms of Psychic Warfare,&quot; characterized again by excellent  lyrics about a breakup and a poppy chorus (tambourine, falsetto and all).   Later in the side, Hart returns with &quot;Books About UFOs,&quot; another  girl-crazy tune with an Honest-to-God piano part (! ) and a shuffling  tempo, where Hart sings &quot;I'm gonna turn into a lens and focus all my  attention / On finding a new planet and naming it right after her!&quot;  But the album's closer is one of the most overwhelming tracks on the  record: &quot;Plans I Make&quot; begins with a brutal     guitar/drum riff  and takes off from there, reaching the point of sonic meltdown, with Mould  working the band and himself into a frenzy, shrieking and bellowing over  guitar driving nails into the listener, &quot;GO... GO... GO MAKE PLANS...  GO MAKE PLANS.&quot;  The band eventually crashes to a halt and a single  note of agonizing feedback envelops Mould as he groans &quot;make....  plans.... make..... plans....&quot; over and over until he too chokes to a  stop.<br />This record amazes me.  It's the Huskers' most sustained moment of  pure musical power -- it placed #8 in NME's 100 Best Records, '85-'95, and  well deserved it.  While their later material lost some of the sheer  ferocity of this record, and much of their earlier material is  underproduced and unstructred, this record truly is the best of both worls.   It will blow you away -- literally."
1847,5,Nelly is one of the greatest upcoming rappers in this world that already has so many good rappers if i were you get his cd you wont regret it!  Ohh yeah bobby nelly is the best!
1848,5,"Carl Thomas's debut CD &quot;Emotional&quot; is a MUST HAVE!  He has an exceptional voice that sounds like no other artist out today.  He sings with so much soul and emotion that the listener can actually empathize with  him.  Of couse, I am totally loving his debut single &quot;I Wish.&quot;   This single is the classic love song of regret.  Thomas sings as if he  KNOWS what he is singing about--hurt, pain, and the loss of love!  And the  video to &quot;I Wish&quot; is one of the few videos that actually  complements the song!  I love that and would not change the video. It's  perfect!  Other songs that are &quot;must listen to&quot; cuts are  &quot;Lady, Lay Your Body,&quot; &quot;Emotional,&quot; &quot;Cold, Cold  World,&quot; and one of my favorites &quot;Summer Rain.&quot;  If you don't  have this CD, RUN and go get it!  It's a must have for any lover of classic  pure, R&amp;B Soul Music."
1849,5,"I was just a teen when Take On Me hit the airwaves in the US. The song was/is like no other, as was the video. The ONLY bad thing about this album is that it's too short. If it had 30 songs on it, it would still be too  short. It is just like a good book, never long enough.<br />All the songs on  this cd are excellent, and my favorites are Living A Boys Adventure Tale,  The Sun Always Shines On Tv and of course, Take On Me.<br />But if you live in  the U.S., then you must think that Take On Me is the only song ever put out  by this misunderstood and mislead band. Well I have learned that the radio  is NOT the place to go to if you want to listen to good music. <br />a-ha's  second (Scoundrel Days), and third (Stay On These Roads)albums are also  excellent and the band sticks to their previous style and sound as in  Hunting High and Low. They are both worthy additions to your library. But  read on.<br />But if you want to understand what a mistake the U.S. has made  with this band, Warner Bros. especially, then I would recommend you also  pick up East of The Sun, West of the Moon and Memoral Beach. These two  albums show just how mature the band has become. The songwriting is  excellent and the sound is like none other. These albums are TOTALLY  different from Hunting High and Low, but then again, why would you want the  same thing? Early Morning on EOSWOM and Cold as Stone on Memorial Beach are  two examples of this bands greatness. Both could be hits in the U.S. today,  if they could just get a little radio airtime. Yeah, right. Most of what is  on the radio today is TRASH! Record companies today are signing one album  wonders instead of promoting AND supporting good musicians, which in the  long run, is beneficial to both parties involved. Radio broadcasters have  their songs preselected for them and don't dare play anything not on their  list. What a shame and a sham.<br />Pick up Hunting High and Low, then pick up  one of their most recent releases. Go into a quiet room, turn off the  lights and simply listen to the albums 3 or 4 times. You won't be  dissapointed."
1850,2,"A very disappointing record. Running to a little under 30 minutes, this is a *must have* only for the Oldfield, Ayers, or Bedford *completeist*.<br />Not as random or as scattered musically as Bedford's *Nurses songs for  elephants* but do not expect this to throw forward any gems by this usually  impecable threesome.<br />Buy it if you *need* it. Not to listen to."

1852,4,"I bought the cassette not expecting much, not only is it now my favorite this music will make even a cheap stereo sound HUGE!  I am a guitar player with intrests from ozzy to stevie ray vaughan but right now they are all  collecting dust...because Tommy put together some monster sounds on this  release..song after song Methods of Mayhem is witout a doubt the thumpinest  stuff currently available."
1853,5,"&quot;The Fundamental Elements of Southtown&quot; has got to be one of the fattest CD's out there in this genre for a while.  The band P.O.D with members Sony (vocals), Traa (drums), Wuv (bass) and Marcos (guitars) show  their musical diversity with bits of raggae, rock, rap, metal and even some  jazz drum beats to spice it up.  Solid guitar riffs and occasional bass  slaps ala Korn hold most of the songs.<br />In terms of mix, the drums have  been well mixed (something which a lot of other bands this style fail to  do), and the bass well layered over it.  Most guitar bits have been layered  at least twice.  The vocals fit in snuggly, back but not too far into the  mix.  Best heard in &quot;boom-boxes&quot;.  There has been a lot of  effects layering into the final mix with vocals and overall sound.<br />Top  tracks to listen to : Southtown (Single out now), Outkast, Lie Down, Rock  the Party (Off the Hook) and Hollywood."
1854,5,"I lOVE this CD. The lady is a real diva. She has powerful words enlightened by her faith, but don't  listen, if you don't want. Just feel this beautiful, pure voice and that great sense of rythm! If some songs are  not for all ears (I don't like &quot;lost ones&quot; for example, 'cause I  can't stand rap. I find it boring), I must acknowledge the lady successes  is mixing different styles of music such as R&amp;B and hip-hop. maybe one  of the best artists of these present times!"
1855,3,"HEY HEY WHAT ARE YOU DOING WELL AS TO THE CD'S ARE GOING THEY AREN'T DOING SO HOT.THEY MAY BE COOL TODAY BUT THEY WON'T BE TOMORROW.SO MAYBE WE SHOULD'T BE BUYING THEM BECAUSE THEY COST TOO MUCH MONEY AND THE REST OF  THE SONGS ARE REALLY SORRY.WELL I GOT TO RRUN NOW SO WRITE BACK I'M NOT  REALLY IN TO NOTHING RIGHT NOW SO WRITE BACK,.BYE BYE"
1856,5,"I was delighted when I finally got my hands on this one. After the first Pooh album, I was convinced this one would be even better. After listening for the &quot;first run&quot;, I was totally overwhelmed! Just simply  amazing,how such lovely songs kept flowing out of this man! My 15-mth old  daughter would love this - mind you, she's got Collin Raye's Counting Sheep  all over her now! Personally, I truly enjoy this album and in  particular...&quot;Turn Around&quot; makes me feel like a child again  because that was when I first heard and fell for it. Years have gone,but  this song still tugs my heartstrings. If you need some music equivalent to  &quot;chicken soup for the heart and soul&quot;..this is it. It's every  penny's worth!"
1857,1,How can someone review an album when there is no track list? damn!
1858,5,"Black Sabbath's &quot;Heaven &amp; Hell&quot; and Dio's &quot;Holy Diver&quot; are one of best true heavy metal albums ever written, right?  &quot;The Age of Mastery&quot; will be a strong copmetitor to them. I would  not say it is better, even though I almost wanted to. &quot;The age  of..&quot; is a mixture of classic heavy metal and 90's power metal with  some folk influence. They dont make much such a music anymore and it would  be mistake to skip such a great masterpiece. It is a straightforward heavy  metal for its truest sence! Do not be afraid of any cliches, it is fresh  and strong. I love it!"
1859,5,This new record of NSync's is really good. The sound is most excellent and not to mention the vocals. This is not another teenybopper-bubblegum record. It is really fun and sounds superb! Avoid the other reviews of this  record that say it's not worth buying and GO GET IT AND SEE FOR YOURSELF!
1860,5,"At long last, here's a musical that can cope with Les Mis and Sunset Boulevard. You don't necessarily have to know french to begin crying; the music takes you to the edge of the inexpressable. What can I say after all  the other reviews? Just buy this CD now- if not for the others, at least  for that grieving &quot;Les Oiseaux...&quot;"
1861,3,"HUMMM... WELL THANKS FOR REMINDING ME WHY I DON'T AS A RULE BUY SOUNDTRACK ALBUMS NO MATTER HOW MUCH I LIKE THE FEATURE GROUP. THE U2 STUFF HERE IS GREAT. MELODIC, HAUNTING, AND FULL OF THE GUTS AND SOUND THAT YOU EXPECT  FROM THE IRISH GANG. BUT... AND A HUGE BUT...THE BALANCE OF THIS ALBUM IS  MEDIOCRE TO JUST PLAIN BAD. THE ROCK CUTS ARE GENERIC AND BLAND, THE JAZZ  CUTS ARE WEAK, AND MILLA'S  2 FORAYS INTO SONG ARE THE WORST THING I'VE  HEARD SINCE THE FIRST YOKO ONO SOLO ALBUM. KIDDING ASIDE, THE SCREECHING  ACTUALLY STARTLED MY POOR DOG...DIDN'T DO A LOT FOR ME! THIS CD IS DESIGNED  FOR THE DO IT YOURSELFER...TAPE OR BURN THE U2 STUFF TO LISTEN TO, AND CAN  THE CD ONTO THE BACK SHELF..."
1862,5,"If you are the kind of person that has a deep love for music that has spirit, don't miss this CD.  It is majestic, it is deeply moving and it will lift your spirits and energize you.  Enigma has a way of opening up  spiritual rhelms...this is their best so far!  My favorite is &quot;Endless  Quest&quot;, but they are all good.  &quot;Screen Behind the Mirror&quot;  is anything but ordinary.  I think people of all ages would enjoy this  music."
1863,5,"In a year filled with great music releases, I have to look to David Mead as my favorite. His songs have a fabulous pop quality without being trite (think Squeeze, Elvis Costello). His voice has a range reminiscent of Tim  or Jeff Buckley. Caught him perform at a small coffee shop in our  neighborhood--this after having fell in love with the album. Every song was  as masterful in person as it is on the album. Buy this. Play this. Love  this."
1864,5,"Daniela Droz es una nueva interprete la cual tiene mucho talento. Su disco &quot;Cosas De Mujeres&quot; es muy bailable y a su vez romantico. Daniela Droz luego de su carrera de actriz se lanza como cantante con mucho exito.  Los mejores temas del disco son &quot;Sin El&quot;, &quot;Dama De  Hierro&quot;, &quot;Mar Y Cielo&quot;, &quot;Veneno&quot;, y &quot;Hasta  Hoy&quot;. Muy buen disco."
1865,5,"The 4th LP from Britain's Best Band is certainly chock-full of the standard Oasis sound, but this time around Noel and the boys have a darker, brooding sound with (perhaps to please critics) more complicated bass riffs  and drum tracks and overall a more pulsing beat (perhaps influenced by the  70s punk rock Noel is reputed to be into lately). <br />Many of the tunes rely  on minor chords and the lyrics are certainly not of the  &quot;ain't-it-great-to-be-alive&quot; kind found on the first 3 albums.  Sure, there's the optimistic openers 'Go Let It Out' and the sweeping,  love-laden, and sitar-driven 'Who Feels Love?' but there's also the  take-no-prisoners 'F----- In The Bushes,' 'Put Yer Money Where Yer Mouth  Is,' and 'I Can See A Liar.'<br />'Gas Panic!' is perhaps the greatest  surprise here. It opens innocently enough, but by the 2nd verse, Alan  White's drums and Bonehead's bass kick it up a notch (a la Emeril!)  Considering this song documents Noel's battle with cocaine addiction, it's  strikingly powerful and Liam's raspy voice gives it a proper edge. <br />It's  not 'Morning Glory,' but then again it ain't 'Be Here Now' either.  'Standing...' is refreshing for anyone who feels Oasis' music is  repetitive, but all the while it'll surely satisfy ol' die-hards like me."
1866,4,"As a fan of Buck o Nine, i expected this cd to be a great followup to their last one.  boy, was i ever wrong.  most of the songs are extremely boring, and the only cool thing about the disc was the cover.  do yourself  a great big favor and save the money....buy Pass the Dutchie instead."
1867,5,"Excellent compilation of tracks from the post-Westbound, major label era. Great selection, great sound quality, a dollop of humor, and a nice price as well. \\""Who Says a Funk Band Can't Play Rock?\\"" is the ultimate crossover statement for this funk-rock band!"
1868,5,"While Django was receiving well deserved accolades for his mastery of the guitar, a little known contemporary from Argentina, Oscar Aleman, was tearing it up in the Western Hemisphere.  This is a wonderful two disc set  spanning Oscar's premier years from 1938 - 1957.  It is loaded with  virtuoso treatments of both standards and originals.  Oscar's incredibly  fluid style is quite impressive --if not stunning.  Some say he was under  appreciated because his style is so Djangoesque.  Hmmm, somehow I don't see  that as a problem.  There are too many selections to name as highlights,  though I could live with a little less of the strings and clarinet (staples  of the era) on some of the early numbers.  None the less, this is awesome  Jazz guitar with a latin flavor.  An amazing player."
1869,3,for awhile in the mid to late 80's Jay King&amp;crew had a jam out each year it seemed.who knew the impact of Why you treat me so bad? that song has been sampled so many ways&amp;#215;.some of the material has held up  and some hasn't but Club Noveau made a mark.
1870,5,"For those who never heard this album before be for warned. 6 of the 11 tracks are almost entirely instrumental. The CD begins with an instrumental piece called \\""speed of life\\"" which is exellent and sets the tone  for the rest of the CD with it's nice guitar riff and tempo. The following  5 songs are among bowie's finest work ever! A nice mix of searing guitar  and keyboards with lyrics that are terse and thought provoking.  \\""Breaking glass\\"", \\""sound and vision\\"" and \\""always  crashing in the same car\\"" are absolute classics! The seventh cut, an  instrumental called \\""A new career in a new town\\"" crackles with  energy. Within these 7 songs is a unique guitar sound that seems to bind everything together. At this point the work is a rock classic. Then it changes substantially. The final 4 cuts are all synth based instumentals, each a bit different from the other.   As a result this album may take some more time to appreciate. Originally i found the instrumentals to be a bit of a drag on a great album. My idea of great instrumental comes from years of listening to other prog rock bands that deliver virtuoso caliber solos and grand arrangements. Here however i can see the quality in the organization, the themes and the texture of the sound. Bowie and eno deliver something different but terrific..    Bowie's best? Tough call with ziggy, station to station and diamond dogs which i truly love. Certainly on the level of those classic albums. One of the 25 best albums from the 70s.."
1871,5,"This is a great CD for those interested in chanting-type music.  This music features Baka chants of Cameroun, Burundi, Senegal, and of the Pygmies.  The music is peaceful and relaxing to listen to.  Visions of  tribal communities helping one another exist come to mind.  I highly  reccommend this CD for New Age chant searching buyers.  &quot;Sweet  Lullaby&quot; is especially appealing to the ears of Deep Forest's  listeners."
1872,5,"I bought this CD a number of years ago and soon afterward I moved to Paris.  Let me tell you, riding the metro and strolling the streets of the &quot;city of lights&quot; while listening to the euphoric sounds of  Delirium was something that saved me.  And everytime I play it during  dinner parties, people always asked me who it was...  The vocals are so  soothing and my favorite cut &quot;Firefly&quot; helps to put a spring in  your step and a smile on your face.  Truthfully, this is one of the most  soothing and beautiful CDs I've ever had the pleasure of hearing.  And one  that I never get tired of."
1873,1,this is cotton candy material.the vocals are lame.they are the minor league version of TLC.don't waste your time or money.
1874,5,"&quot;Betty&quot; is a pure classic from the band that just never could make a bad album. They added more elements to their sound on &quot;Betty&quot;, without betraying the harsh, brutal sound of  &quot;Meantime&quot; that they crafted their sound from. Adding bits of  jazz and hip-hop into their sound, they came off with an excellent  collection of heavy yet diverse sounding songs that bypassed anything they  had done before. Too bad for everyone that never got the chance to hear  about them, because they broke up about a year or two ago. Fortunately,  we're left with albums like this and &quot;Meantime&quot; to make up for  all of the other bands that just aren't creative enough to make cd's this  good."
1875,3,"This particular band has a very unique, harmonious sound that should appeal to almost any fan of good music. Ha.  The songs are always interesting, and the music flows with a smoothness not found in many other  bands. While this cd is pretty good, Very Secretary's contribution to the  &quot;Postmarked Stamps&quot; complilations from Tree records is excellent.  I really recommend that album(&quot;Postmarked Stamps&quot;)."
1876,5,"It's a shame they're not the same way now, as I wish they would do similar material. The Pearl Jam today is no longer Pearl Jam; it's a wannabe folk band that likes to collaborate with other artists. The Pearl Jam back in  91/92, however, were an excellent hard rock band which essentially opened  the scene for 90s alternative rock (and alternative metal). What was so  great about the album? Well, each track told a story. Not in a spoken-word  way, in a &quot;Van Morrison way&quot; with guitar riffs and deft bass work  in the background.  Their live shows were pretty cool, too.(At this point,  they're all pretty old, but they could always make a comeback!) You won't  think I'm being absurd by saying that THIS album is to rock music what The  Godfather is to motion pictures."
1877,5,"Listening to this recording is to transcend yourself to a place of awe and wonder! Awe, because of the peace and tranquility you receive from just listening to each track - and wonder, because you wonder how John Gary's  voice can be so pure and have the range and clarity of so many octaves.  (There is no falsetto, here!)  The orchestrations, the diction and the  breath control are mind-boggling! To say you feel a chill run up your spine  with each and every high note, would not be an exaggeration.  This  recording is 5 Star from start to finish!  If a man's life is summed up by  his body of work in life - then this recording of John Gary's is definately  the sum total!"
1878,5,"2Pac is by far my favorite rap artist, he has a great voice,beats,and themes. This album was one of his best and the first double disc in rap. I belive that 2pac is still alive and will come back one day. 2PAC 4 LIFE"
1879,5,"The great lady had done it again.  Sitting in the audience at A &amp; T State University in the 70's, I felt her to be one of the most arrogant and rude entertainers I had ever seen on stage.  I did not know or understand  her message.  Yet, in spite of my perception, she was singing something to  me that I felt but did not comprehend.  One cannot live outside of his/her  experience. Now, 30 years later, I finally get it!  This is an album which  I play over and over.  Each time brings new discoveries.  Only a piece like  &quot;Sunday in Savannah&quot; captures the essence of small town America  like no other.  Where are you Nina?  Come home to North Carolina.  I want  to see another live performance!"
1880,5,"Oh, I wonder-wonder hoom-a-doo-doo-who?  Who has bought this album and owes it soley to the fact that Kurt Kobain and company played not 1..not 2...but THREE songs with Kris and Kurt Curkwood on MTV's Unplugged and  muttered &quot;All these songs are from their second album.&quot;  ? <br />Cuz  that's what I did.  Don't expect anything like their (1994?) top-40 hit  Backwater; that song's as different from the material on II as their  full-length debut--an odd synthesis of slop-hardcowpunk songs that I would  NOT recommend to just anyone--is.  Kirkwood's off-key, troubled voice grows  on one in an EXTREMELY appealing fashion, as the boys slap their  instruments through these varied songs that lie somewhere between punk and  country; folk and ballad (Listen at the very LEAST for the Neil Young-esque  &quot;The Whistling Song&quot;). Awesome.<br />Warning:  Takes several listens  to fully appreciate, but once one is hooked, they will no doubt curse the  rather short-length (under a half an hour? ) of this fine, fine rock  masterpiece.  The End."
1881,4,"hardly a debut album from these Kentucky boys, considering they've sporatically toured the midwest for nearly a decade.  this is more, in fact, a return to the bluegrass roots these boys were weened upon.  less a  burning of bridges, as a shedding of hard rock veneer (must we forget their  now out of print 1991 album &quot;Alabama comin' clean&quot; - brilliant  though a bit hard edged for my likes).  though the production of &quot;the  Tennessee Fire&quot; does waver from studio to garage aesthetic, the  haunted memories that linger in your mind are all the proof you need to  realize this is Americana at it's finest."
1882,5,I LOVE PATSY CLINE AN AM A HUGE FAN OF HERS. LEE ANN SOUNDS QUITE LIKE HER AN PUTS THE EFFORT INTO IT AS PATSY DID AN MAKES YOU FEEL IT INSIDE AN SMILE OUTSIDE. A GREAT ALBUM DO SHARE WITH HER FANS. I LOVE IT.
1883,5,"No one has ever matched Roger Wagner in performances of 16th Century polyphony and this performance of Palestrina's finest was probably Roger's best as well. Impeccable pitch and balance, purity of sound and  irresistable phrasing lead to a searing intensity that makes today's  recorded performances seem merely pedantic. Even when initially released on  long playing vinyl discs, the quality of the sound engineering was  disappointing, but as with old Toscanini recordings, once you concentrate  on the performance you are drawn right into it.<br />You might wonder how  Roger Wagner, a boy from Hollywood, found his way to 16th Century choral  art. His Alsatian father was organist at the Catholic Church in Hollywood.   He sent his adolescent son to France to learn Gregorian Chant from the  monks of Solesmes and of course, chant was the basis for all ecclesiastic  polyphony. Wagner returned to Los Angeles and the Music Departments of USC  and UCLA, conducted choirs in several Catholic Churches here, and  established the world-touring Roger Wagner Chorale and the Los Angeles  Music Center's Masterworks Chorale which performs to this day  with the Los  Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra. <br />Marilyn Horne and Marni Nixon were very  young members of the Roger Wagner Chorale at about the time of this  Palestrina recording.  I wonder if they were at these tapings. Does anyone  out there in cyberspace know?"
1884,5,This album is inexhaustible.  The only Amazon reviewer who didn't give this CD 4 or 5 stars also recommended Oasis.  Nuff said.
1885,5,"I've never heard anything like this.  I would describe the tracks as original piano compositions which develop expressive, accessible themes and are infused with the complexity and aesthetic appeal of some modern  concepts in mathematics.  This has a really rich variety of thoughts and a  lively and focused progression that is very engaging as well as simply fun  to listen to.  I recommend this to anyone."
1886,5,I have played this CD every day since I purchased it. The songs keep going through my head. I have never had a CD where every song was a treasure. I keep hoping there will be a sequel. I have recommended this to all my  friends. It is a must for anyone's collelction
1887,5,"this Bertolucci movie was really beautiful and so is the soundtrack. It is simply brilliant &amp; in my opinion Sakamoto´s very best! A mixture of ancient sounds, slow strings, islamic chants and heartbreaking melodies,  just BEAUTIFUL !<br />Buy it, it´s a must! Rik"
1888,5,This young lady has the talent to take her far. I've owned this album since it first came out and I still find it a thrill to listen to.The rhythms sparkle and her voice is captivating. Just the right number of slow  and upbeat songs makes for a well rounded effort.Simply one of the best  albums of the year.
1889,5,"I watched the Sheryl Crow and Friends concert back on Sept. 14th 1999 on FOX. I loved the show. On the mtv.com site it came up that Sheryl planned on releasing it as a  CD..All the artists were great on here and the sound  quality is awesome..Sheryl Crow did a great job choosing her quests and the  songs. Highlight songs of the show for me were &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot;  by Stevie Nicks, &quot;If It Makes You Happy&quot; with Chrissie Hynde,  &quot;Everyday is a Winding Road&quot; By Sheryl Crow and &quot;Tombstone  Blues&quot; with all the &quot;friends&quot;.     I really enjoyed this CD  which I got for Christmas, I listen to it almost everyday. Stevie Nicks is  absolutely the highlight of this concert, with her &quot;raspy&quot;  magnificent voice, singing her Fleetwood Mac classic song &quot;Gold Dust  Woman&quot;, and looking great also might I add. Sheryls' band really adds  to the awesome performances too!"
1890,5,"This is a very great CD!   Once again, Michael has come through with His Christian/pop CD that will touch lives forever!   MWS Rox!   This has songs ranging from how to persevere in your Christian walk to songs to his  daughters to love songs to His wife.  I LOVE the new CD."
1891,5,"I bought this disc on a whim. A fan of 20th-century music, I had heard enough of Korngold's film music to know that I enjoyed his more-romantic-than-mahler-or-strauss style, when I was in the mood for that  kind of thing, and I had heard a fair bit of Weill's &quot;serious&quot;  music in the past. I really wanted to hear what he could do with a violin  concerto.<br />I was not prepared for the Krenek. It blew me away. Here is the  one essential 20th century violin concerto [well, one of them, anyway]. It  is both bitter and swet, strident and romantic. It teeters on the edge of  dissonance without abandoning the late-19-century german style. It is  brilliance.<br />In fact, the whole disc is brilliant. The performances are  flawless, and the recording is superb. I only hope that, performed as they  are here, these works will stimulate a renaissance of 20th century music."
1892,5,"&quot;98 Degrees &amp; Rising&quot; is actually the first album of the guys' that I bought, and it's just unbelievable.  Jeff, Nick, Drew &amp; Justin put so much feeling and emotion into their singing, I know it sounds  corny, but I sometimes feel what the song is saying.  &quot;She's Out of My  Life&quot; isn't an original song, but the guys sang it so beautifully that  I cried.  No joke.  Jeff &amp; Nick did an amazing job a cappella.  I've  heard Michael Jackson's original, and the guys definitely sound better.   They're not crying, but they put so much emotion into their singing that  you can almost feel their &quot;pain.&quot;  The tracks are either fun and  upbeat (Heat It Up, Because of You, Do You Wanna Dance, True to Your Heart)  or heartfelt (I Do, Still, She's Out of My Life, The Hardest Thing).  Jeff  has changed the way he sings a little from the first album-not that he  needed to, but it's definitely noticeable.  And it's cool to hear Justin  &amp; Drew in &quot;Do You Wanna Dance.&quot;  It's one of my favorite  albums-though I admit I am biased because 98 Degrees is my favorite, ever  since I heard &quot;Invisible Man&quot; and &quot;The Hardest Thing&quot;  on the radio.  Anyone who likes R&amp;B/Motown would love this CD because  the guys are definitely rooted in that genre of music, and they do an  excellent job on their sophomore project.  &quot;98 Degrees &amp;  Rising&quot; is an awesome album, and the guys really are extremely  talented."
1893,4,"This is not one of Elfman's best scores but is amazing! The main titles give a sense of a millitary atmosphere and chaos. The ones I found most interesting are The Main Title, The Landing, and the eerie Ungodly  Experiments. The best use of the choir in this cd is Ungodly Experiments.  The rest of the cd is ok. The score for Mars Attacks is remarkable. Even  the song by Tom Jones fits well in this album."
1894,5,"Don't get me wrong, it's not like I think Robby is hot or anything ('cause my friends and I made fun of his looks and compared him to another friend), but he is such an awesome guy. He's such a big teddy bear. He by far makes  the band. And also, if you ever read this John, my good friend Debbie is  DESPERATELY in love with you. Give her a chance. BLINK182 rules!"
1895,5,"This album is propolled by a love of music, soul and musicianship at its best.  The steel guitar and keyboard are crisp and inspiring. It has a country flair with blues intertwined throughout.   Play this album and  people will ask for the name."
1896,4,"Even in 1957, how many more times could you have heard &quot;Jingle Bells,&quot; &quot;I'll Be Home For Christmas,&quot; or any Christmas classic before they seemed repetitive? Especially if you're Frank Sinatra  and Gordon Jenkins (who had earlier worked on the sad, beautiful  &quot;Where Are You?&quot;)  recording in mid-July Los Angeles. But the  beautiful results heard here speak to the staying power of these songs and  to the mastery of their singer. The songs mentioned above, plus &quot;The  Christmas Song,&quot; &quot;Christmas Waltz,&quot; &quot;First Noel,&quot;  and Mendelsson's &quot;Hark The Herald Angels Sing,&quot; receive  beautiful, lush string treatments with the reverence Jenkins always gave to  Sinatra's most serious material. On the remastered version, Nelson Riddle's  &quot;Christmas Waltz&quot; is also uncovered; it's interesting to compare  the two versions. This music is every bit as refreshing as a breath of cool  Christmas air."
1897,5,"I consider this album to be one of the most enjoyable Emmylou Harris albums in my collection.  Emmylou has a wonderful voice, and I think it works so wonderfully in duets that music fans would be short-changing  themselves if they missed out on this masterpiece.<br />Comprised primarily  (perhaps entirely) of previously released material, &quot;Duets&quot; is a  tribute to Harris' vocal beauty and skills at interpretation (and her skill  at picking singing partners).  Each song is strong in its own right,and yet  the album is something more than the sum of its parts.  The brilliance of  Harris' performances and the variety of her partners is truly  impressive.<br />What sets this CD apart from many of Emmylou Harris' solo  efforts is that this is a collection of uniformly well-written songs  performed by Harris in her vocal prime.  With the exception of  &quot;Wrecking Ball,&quot; none of her solo albums resonate with me as  deeply as this one.  From the familiar classic cuts (&quot;Love Hurts&quot;  and &quot;That Lovin' You Feelin' Again&quot;) to the surprises (a  great(? ) rousing John Denver song and a definitive version of Townes Van  Zandt's &quot;If I Needed You&quot; with Don Williams), Emmylou shines  brightly and consistently throughout this album.  And here peformance with  Willie Nelson on &quot;Gulf Coast Highway&quot; is truly fabulous.<br />The  Amazon.com review notwithstanding, I think this is a fine introduction to  Emmylou Harris (it certainly was for me).  If you appreciate brilliant  vocal harmonies, you'll appreciate this one."
1898,5,"If you like harsh vocal german industrial, In Strict Confidence is definetely for you.  I've listened to this disc quite a bit over the two years I've owned it, and it's still good to pop it in and listen to  stripped, which is a masterful remake of a Depeche classic.  five stars for  that version alone, but the rest of the disc is great too.  If you like  this one, make sure to pick up 'Face the Fear', which is even better.  Top  notch!"
1899,5,"This is the best disco compilation I have ever hear. I looked and looked for a long time for a collection of top disco hits on CD. Most of the ones that I found were collections of unknown artist recreating the original  hits. This was the first one I found that had original artist playing the  songs. I tried Pure Disco and liked it so much that I bought Pure Disco 2,  3 and Pure Funk! All of them are great! These have great production value  too. The graphics on the CDs are a hoot!"
1900,3,"This is a so-so album. The problem with R.E.M. is they have one basic pretty good sound, but they repeat that same sound song after song. The joke of it all is that Michael Stipe says the Beatles were worthless...BUT  IF YOU LISTEN TO THE BEATLES' SONG &quot;RAIN,&quot; THAT IS R.E.M.'S BASIC  SOUND, RIGHT THERE! The vocals, the instruments, everything. Maybe Stipe  himself wasn't influenced by the Beatles, but whoever DID influence  Stipe/R.E.M. was influenced by the Beatles. And the Beatles  &quot;Rain&quot; blows away anything R.E.M. did, or ever could do. Listen  to &quot;Rain&quot; before you buy R.E.M. And then if you're in the mood  for second-raters,  R.E.M. will fit the bill."
1901,5,"definitely of interest.  <br />in this instance, i advise you to disregard the endless comparative evaluation and attempts at categorisation present in many of these reviews.  <br />i was stimulated by this recording, that  alone was sufficient.<br />the stimulation was  -at times conscious, ie.  direct enjoyment and intrigue;  -at times provocative, ie. thought  inducing; and  -at times spiritual, eg. beauty of last track of  disk2.<br />just to contextualise my statements, however, i'll illustrate the  difference between my perspective and another reviewer:   they asked  &quot;is this really music?&quot; i answer &quot;everything is  music&quot;<br />[insert musical jargon here]<br />ryan"
1902,5,"I can only echo what others have said -- Heather Nova's ''Oyster'' is one my favorite CDs.  I bought ''Siren'' first, but I think I prefer ''Oyster'' a little more, if that's possible.  Heather's lyrics, music and voice seem  to touch me more than any other female singer-songwriter I've heard, and  that's saying a lot.  I can't wait for her next album!"
1903,5,"This release is a major &quot;find&quot; for those who are fans of the work of John Williams.  It is the third in the series of scores taken from &quot;Lost in Space,&quot; and is, by the far, the best.  The episode  &quot;My Friend, Mr. Nobody&quot; features a poignant score by Williams's  that foreshadows many of the melodies that he would later use in the  blockbuster films of which he is noted.  This is a true treasure because of  Williams place as one of the most prolific and popular of motion picture  composers.  The disc also features incidental music from the LIS episode  &quot;The Derelict,&quot; with music by Hans Salter, Herman Stein, and  Richard LaSalle.  As a further &quot;historical&quot; addition, the  rejected second season theme composed by Warren Barker is included.  After  listening to it, I can understand why!"
1904,4,"I usually listen to electronic/experimental kinds of music because most alternative sounds inert and indifferent to me, and I don't really care for the standard chorus-verse-chorus popsong format. <br />But I bought this album  because of the great layered guitar textures, and the fact that the popsong  format only adds to a warm dreamy hypnotic kind of atmosphere. Though the  vocals do make me think of Enya here and there (which is not pleasant  thing). Seefeel's Starethrough is similar but with less poppyness."
1905,5,"I've only listened to the FIRST FOUR TRACKS (2 of which I had already heard before in concert) and I can already tell this is possibly Reba's best album ever! It's certainly the best of her last three albums, which  didn't live up to the incredible awesome &quot;Read My Mind&quot;.  I've  been waiting on this one for a while.  I'm in Reba bliss."
1906,5,I first heard &quot;Get Ready To Bounce&quot; on the &quot;Hackers&quot; 2nd soundtrack and just had to have they're full cd. This is probably one of the best cd's I've ever bought. High energy music that just screams to  be danced to. If you like Techno and Dance you'll love this cd.
1907,4,"Mariahs new album &quot;rainbow&quot; is a perfect gift for anyone who likes pop/r&amp;b(I got it for a gift and loved it.  Tracks like &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; &quot;Thank God I found you&quot; and  &quot;Pedals&quot; are just some of the best tracks.  However, it was not  needed to include the heartbreaker remix.  &quot;X-girlfirend&quot; is very  reminicent of TLC's &quot;No Scrubs&quot;(The part after the bridge  &quot;nnnnnnnoooooo.....sssscccrrruuubbss&quot;  repeated, well in &quot;X  girlfriend&quot;  it goes right after a similar bridge  &quot;xxxxxx....girlfirend&quot; and the backround dripping noise is quite  similar, which is why i gave it 1 less than 5 stars."
1908,5,"I'm a gigantic music fan and I love to find new music. And in my opinion,you just have to experience the sound of IZZ yourself! There is no other way to put it. Endless Calling, Assurance,I Get Lost and Razor!!!(  you'll feel these in your chest!! ) Take your time with this music. There  are lots of details to analyze. The more I listened to this cd the more I  respect it."
1909,5,"A wonderful record which keeps getting better!  Haven't bought any of his other records because I can't imagine him being better than this.  Correct me, please."
1910,5,I think that Rick Springfield is one of the best singers in the whole world.His records are great to listen to.
1911,1,"What David Crosby has to do with space is anyone's guess.  Take all the stuff that he wrote with CSN that DIDN'T get radio play, and throw all of that style onto a disc, with a couple other guys that can make a clever  acronym.  This album offers nothing memorable, but the Album cover sure is  pretty."
1912,4,"This is a great CD.  One thing I love about the Girls is that they are constantly trying new things without abondoning their sound.  Both Amy and Emily have matured as songwriters, yet again. &quot;Gone Again&quot; and  &quot;Cold Beer and Remote Control&quot; are already taking their places as  2 of my favorite Girls songs.  Great follow up!"
1913,5,"Barton has an amazing way with words, with interesting juxtapositions. Close your eyes while listening to any of the songs and you will be carried away to a fantasy/reality probably unlike any previous emotion you've had.  He's truly a major composer!"
1914,5,"Of all the Doris day music I own, this is the best. You get a real feel for this woman and her music.A must have for any Doris Day fan."
1915,5,I think this is slayers best album since RIB.  no other album of theres since RIB can top this.. the first time i heard it i didnt really care for it then i really started listening and I LOVED IT !!
1916,5,it's great they released this since the songs are really hard to get.... Niap is my favourite
1917,4,"One reason I usually avoid live albums is one good songs, they don't leave well enough alone. They feel a need to make changes to the original rendition that usually leave me disappointed.  Not so on this CD. Its  GREAT!! Keiko spices up her original compositions while keeping with her  signature sound.  You'll especially love Bridge over the Stars, Forever  Forever and Bonfire in the Piano. This will satisfy the true Keiko fan and  serve as a &quot;fix&quot; until the next studio album. Enjoy."
1918,5,"One of my parents' favorite recordings, I listened to this as a child until the grooves were worn off the record.  Mainly a capella, the arrangements are lush, the performance right on, the voices clear.  The  selections range from melancholy in &quot;Shenandoh&quot; to comedy in  &quot;What Shall we do with a drunken sailor.&quot;   I have been looking  for a copy of this recording for years, and am thrilled to see it  re-released."
1919,5,"Travel back to your childhood days when mom busied herself in the kitchen after church, while dad picked out his favorite LP to put on the High-Fi.  It was the only day we listened to Mitch Miller and the Gang, and the  wonderful blend of strong voices still sounds like home.  There is no  replacement."
1920,5,"One problem I've always had with Ella's songbooks, although considered her greatest musical achievement, is that she sang the songs, with the exception of the Duke Ellington songbook, too straight, too serious.  It  was in her later Pablo work, as in her earlier work on Decca, that she  spent a good many recordings bebopping, jamming, and scatting, the kind of  stuff Ella laid claim to.  This album with Count Basie and his orchestra is  exemplary of her propensity to lighten up her performances and have a good  time delivering her lines.  Her voice, thicker with more vibratto, is  actually more interesting than the clear, girlish voice she sang with  throughout her earlier life.  She scats through &quot;Honeysuckle  Rose&quot; and &quot;Ain't Misbehavin&quot;, and swings the usually slow  &quot;I'm Getting Sentimental Over You&quot;.  Her voice is still clear,  her style and rhythm is still unparalleled, and she swings and swings and  swings.  If &quot;Fine and Mellow&quot; is her best work of the 70's, this  one is right behind it.  A great CD for fans of swing and scat and of  course, Ella."
1921,5,"I bought this CD when it first came out cause I got a free sticker in the mail to advertise it.  I figured it sounds like a cool album, then when I bought it home I listened to it and I was blown away.  I litterally fell  off my seat, the singer has a voice like that combines Louie Armstrong with  the lead sing of the Mighty Mighty Bosstones.  He just sounds so cool,  especially on songs like &quot;Lover Lies&quot;  and it also has the  ability to rip it up in songs like &quot;Calypso King&quot;, and  &quot;Flower in Sand&quot; and with those groovin' horn licks This is CD is  Golden."
1922,5,This is the soundtrack from one of her award winning t.v. specials. Fabulous songs from a true legend.
1923,5,"This CD is so soulful, spiritual, truthful, and all i can say is Deep.  I had never heard of her until I saw her video and from there I was hooked. I bought the CD and listen to it everday.  It is just that good. If you like  soulful R &amp; B music, with flava like Ms. Badu herself, then this is the  CD for you."
1924,5,It's a delight to finally hear Joe Traina utilize his these fabulous vocalist many of whom I have had the pleasure of hearing live in New York.  I am extremely delighted with Ms. English's rendition of &quot;I Loves You  Porgy&quot; which I have had the honor of hearing her perform live.  Check  it out! You will not be disappointed.
1925,4,This is a great cd of Sarah's old amd recent songs.  She is one of the few artists that sound just as good live as recorded.
1926,4,"Asia's debut LP is an excellent album that will be appreciated by prog-rock fans and people who like the Backstreet Boys.  The nine cuts are all positive and uptempo, with superb singing and playing from Wetton,  Downes, Howe, and Palmer.  Despite some weak moments that keep it from  getting 5 stars, Asia is a diamond in the 80s rough.  Best cuts are Heat of  the Moment, Only Time will Tell, One Step Closer, and Here Comes the  Feeling.-AJR"
1927,5,"While not as dynamic as say Love, or Electric, it is as good as Sonic Temple if not better. Wild Hearted Son is probably among the best songs  they have ever recorded. It seems much more introspective than much of  their earlier work, which is a nice change of pace."
1928,5,"I agree with everyting in the review by the fan from Oakland. This is one jumpin' CD! Just wanted to correct one small error. The Billtown Blues Association is located in Williamsport, PA, not Baltimore, MD. One  sideline, the BBA just had their 10th annual Blues Fest this weekend which  incuded Mr. Delay in the lineup. He was just fantastic! Pick up this CD and  anything else by Paul Delay for some of the funkiest (and most prodigious)  harp playing you will ever hear."
1929,5,"I will never understand why Randy Newman is not a superstar. His music and lyrics have given us a view of America unlike anyone else has be able to give over the years. He is funny, sad, perverted all at once. Randy Newman  can take a complex melody and make it sound so simple and direct.  BAD LOVE  is another insightful, wonderful example of his vision. The song MY COUNTRY  could be the best song he has written this decade. MY COUNTRY captures the  essence of what America's T.V. culture is really all about in a funny  ironic way. The ending lyric &quot;I'm always sorta happy when they go  away&quot; is pure genuis. Add to this the hilarious BIG HAT, NO CATTLE,  with is mockish country music flavor, and the sad, moving MISS YOU. Randy  Newman even makes fun of himself in I'M DEAD. If you already are a Randy  Newman fan you will love this C.D. If you are not yet a fan and are  considering this C.D. I highly reccomend you give it a try. Randy's style  may not be for everyone, but if you like subtle (and not so subtle) humor  to your music, this is one you should check out. My only concern with the  C.D. is if you read between the lines of some of the lyrics you could get  the feeling this might be his last one. I hope not, we need more writers  like Randy Newman to keep us from getting to sure of ourselfs."
1930,5,"William Topley captures the essence of many forms of music, terrific writing and great musical interludes. It has been a long time since I have enjoyed lyrics so refreshing and thought provoking. His style and voice are  very interesting, he deserves radio play. I feel if one listens to his  music once, it will drive you to listen again and again."
1931,5,"You want music to raise your consiouness to a knew level? Well, Procyon Project have acomplished such a mystical task! I really love track 6 and 7 on cd1. Also, I listen to this &quot;excellent&quot; cd, while I workout  for my full-cont fights. Enjoy it's great!  Peace through Wing Chun."
1932,5,I ORIGINALLY BOUGHT THE ALBUM &amp; WORE IT OUT &amp; BOUGHT IT AGAIN. I NOW HAVE THE CD &amp; LISTEN TO IT OFTEN. IT COVERS ALL HIS DIFFERENT STYLES OF MUSIC. IF YOU LIKE JOHN DENVER YOU WILL LIKE THIS CD.
1933,4,"Forget the TV biopic. Motown does not get any better than this.  All three of this super-group's lead singers (David Ruffin, Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams) alternate between tales of happiness, sorrow, heartache and loss.   The group at its most soulful before it became overly Vegasesque.  Give it  a try."
1934,5,I love Gil and his work!!! I herd of him for @ days and I'm alresdy &quot;IN LOVE&quot;.
1935,3,"While a couple of tracks shine (Demolition Man, Rehumanize Yourself) others never get going. Classics like Bring on the Night just plod along.<br />Unfortunately this album sounds like it was rushed out to take advantage  of the success of the first (better produced) one."
1936,5,"This recording brought back memories of distant daze at university - smoke filled rooms, large speakers and strange coloured lighting.  despite the gap - some 15 years, I re-aquired this album again on cd.  Often cited for  being an imitation of Genesis (Gabriel era) Marillion exceed their loftier  counterparts in several areas.  Firstly the album is a moody one - by which  I mean it has highs and lows.   The orchestration is superb, and the lyrics  spell-bindingly constructed and executed by the lead singer.  The album is  a non-stop rollercoaster ride from start to finish which will have you  singing loudly after a few plays.  Similar in concept to the lamb lies down  on broadway, the album has an over-riding theme (childhood and its  consequences).  Listen out for great lyrics such as &quot; ....black  plastic body bags under nations flags....&quot;   and &quot;....I see a war  widow in a laundrette washing the memories from her husbands clothes...  with cemetary eyes....&quot;  oooh!  I loved the album and still do now,  and play it on occassions when I want to get rid of excess energy.   Have  your tennis racket handy for those guitar solos.!   A definite classic from  an era when most music was synth based.  Buy it! The band have since gone  their separate ways - the lead singer (Fish) had a short solo career.  On  the album as well are some B side recordings and other vinteresting bits  that didn't make it onto the album.   The 'a' cd is the origional album  re-mastered , the 'b' cd other stuff."
1937,4,Queen is a terrific band - no one had  vocal range and showmanship like Freddie Mercury!
1938,5,"They should play it all , all day and night all night, Music from the heart , Nicely Done.......<br />Thanks again Joe E.<br />Brad Martin Graphic Design BMGD"
1939,5,"Yo La Tengo has evolved into the most interesting band in America today.  This is an incredible album from start to finish, displaying a band with endless creativity and talent. Buy it, buy it, buy it.  You won't be sorry."
1940,5,"I had the pleasure of seeing The Phantom of the Opera in San Francisco last September.  Thanks to this CD set, I am able to relive a breathtaking theatre experience over and over again.  Michael Crawford's voice is so  powerful and filled with emotion, I feel my heart break for Phantom with  every listen.  Anyone who loves (or think they might love) this amazing  production MUST have this CD set!"
1941,5,"This album is simply AWESOME. Their live show is even better.  I consider this CD a must have for any collection.  Go see them live....Call your radio station, this music deserves to be heard."
1942,5,"I have, like, a bilion cds, but this is by far my favorite one. Anyone that craves a kick a** guitar, and powerful learics should by this. I did after after only hearing Freak On A Leash, and the whole thing rocks. By  this cd, you won't be disapointed."
1943,4,"Offspring has made some good C.D.s and this is one of them!!Not as good as &quot;SMASH&quot; but, okay. I hope the next C.D. is better. <br />The Offspring is my #2 favorite band, KORN is #1."
1944,4,"Suprised this old album has not been reviewed before, as it is the most accessible piece of work ever put out by Lydon. If it lacks the raw anger of the Pistols era or the drug-induced dysfunction of earlier PiL  offerings, it surely makes up for it in the sheer quality of the  musicianship and the clarity and force of Lydon's vocal delivery. In some  senses this is a top quality melodic rock-pop album; the searing guitar  solo at the end of &quot;Ease&quot; is simply outstanding, as are the  keyboard textures around the single &quot;Rise&quot;. Lydon's voice is at  it's most ruthless; the shouting and atonal straining of the Pistols era  replaced by a focused, bitter, sneering but composed narrative. Lydon has  always been about truth - he has a coruscating intolerance of hypocrisy and  a surprisingly puritan moralistic streak. His cynical humour here is at  it's sharpest &quot;...logic is lost in your  ....cranial abbatoir&quot; he  mocks in &quot;FFF&quot;<br />This is the defining album where Johnny Rotten  ends the process of growing up to become John Lydon. Musical maturity  allied to the unique vocal core of Lydon himself. It can never surpass  &quot;Never Mind The Bollocks&quot; as an album, and there is probably no  single song that rises head and shoulders above the rest in the way that  say &quot;This is Not a Love Song&quot; does. But it remains my favourite  core Lydon offering."
1945,3,"One has to admire the artistic freedom inherent here. As this reissue's good liner notes explain, the Monkees were by now working separately from one another with producers and session men, putting together basically  whatever they wanted to. Needless to say, we get an eclectic result. There  are legitimate big hits by great songwriters, &quot;Daydream Believer&quot;  and &quot;Valleri.&quot; Then there are times you wonder with a laugh,   &quot;what in the *hell* am I listening to?&quot; All in all it's fun, and  the outtakes are of interest."
1946,4,"This album, which looks at many of the daker stories from the bible, is some of the best music the Residents have recorded in the 90's. Despite the fact that their last few releases have been groundbreaking in the world of  interactive media (see also the Freak Show and Bad Day on the Midway  CD-ROMS) the music took a back seat to the larger project.With Wormwood,  The Residents have returned to using music as their medium of choice. While  many of the vocals are less treated and more accessible than in their  earlier works, the music on this album is quite refreshing and undoubtedly  Residential. With song titles like 'God's Magic Finger' and 'He Spills the  Seed' you can't go wrong. A live tour based on this album is planned for  Spring '99 and is eagerly anticipated."
1947,5,"to all the kolks who are moaning about waters absence, i say get a life.while he did lend some creativity to the band, the remaining three are the engine that powers it. i love the album, and am trying to wear it out.  the sound of pink floyd continues to evolve and i look forward to their  next effort. simply put, this is my favorite album preiod"
1948,5,"forget all the hype (for the good and for bad) that has drowned gbv in their own ocean - this album stands above all the droning sounds of &quot;i knew them when...&quot; and shines as brightly as albums like 'devil  between my toes', and 'self inflicted aerial nostalgia' - if you like(d)  gbv for what made them different, not just because they were different -  you will like (love) this album. that's it."
1949,5,You know when you hear a song for the first time and it is so good it gives you chills? This whole album is like that. And it's not just the first time you get this reaction. I have listened to it over a million  times (give or take a few hundred) and it still has the same effect.<br />This  album is pure heaven . . .
1950,5,"THE BEST SONG I LOVE ON THIS CD IS &quot;SOLDIER KING&quot;. THE FIRST TIME I HEARD IT REMINDED ME OF WHY WE REALLY CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS. &quot;O HOLY NIGHT&quot; IS SO BEAUTIFUL. THE ARRANGEMENT ON THIS SONG IS  OVERWHELMING.  THE BEST PART OF THE SONG IS WHEN DONNY COMES IN AND SINGS  {HE TAUGHT US TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER},I'VE NEVER HEARD IT ARRANGED LIKE THAT  BEFORE. I REALLY LIKED HOW HE GOT HIS FAMILY TO SING PARTS ON ONE OF THE  SONGS. I WAS ALSO FAVOURED BY &quot;BABY&quot; WITH DONNY SINGING ALL THE  PARTS.  ALL IN ALL THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE HEARD!"
1951,4,"If you died today, and only one picture were left to memorialize you, would you want it to be a picture from 1977?<br />I would not, and I know of at least one person who wouldn't. Back then, this hairy rock troubador  looked like Grizzly Adams meets John the Baptist: a mad  prophet-in-the-wilderness from Middle Earth. His big, bushy beard and  unkempt long hair had you thinking he usually wore a sign that said,  &quot;REPENT - THE END IS NEAR&quot;.<br />Phil Collins has tried to live down  this image for 20 years. This paid off as he became accepted by EVERYONE,  including that much maligned-by-the-leftist-media demographic, white  middle-class conservative Soccer Moms.<br />Ironically, if fans of today's  retrogressive jam bands like Phish and Widespread Panic saw a picture of  Phil in 1977, and saw Genesis performing &quot;Wind and Wuthering&quot; in  concert, they'd relate to it.<br />And the soccer Moms would probably toss  change in his direction, and hold their noses.<br />&quot;Wind and  Wuthering&quot; is like the gateway drug to other Genesis albums, for that  tiny demographic of music fans who like extended musical epics, complex  time signatures, and fantasy-drenched lyrics like:<br />See the Stewart are  dressed up  He's got eyes in the back of his head.  Who came in a  cockleshell boat  That could only just float,  Couldn't even lift a  sword...<br />If those lyrics made you cringe, or conjured up images of smelly  potential stalkers with backpacks full of Dungeons and Dragons modules,  chances are you won't like this album. If you're intruiged, then keep  reading.<br />&quot;Eleventh Earl of Mar&quot;, an uptempo escapist fantasy  based on the Jacobite Rebellion (with bumbling heros launching a suprise  attack on London) clocks in at 8 minutes. &quot;One for the Vine&quot;, a  psuedo-parable about a would-be messiah, features impressive piano playing  by lead songwriter Tony Banks. &quot;Your Own Special Way&quot; and  &quot;Wot Gorilla&quot; round out the side with shorter, but no less  pastoral, conceptual pieces. Side two begins with a quirky theatrical  piece, &quot;All in a Mouse's Night&quot;, then gets into a total immersion  into all things British, &quot;Blood on the Rooftops&quot;, and wraps up  with a trilogy of songs based on Emily Bronte's &quot;Wuthering  Heights&quot;. <br />If you've ever wondered about early Genesis, but are  skeptical that anything Phil Collins did could be cool, this is the one to  buy. <br />Play it to your friends and tell them it's a new supergroup with  members of Tool, Phish, and Widespread Panic. <br />They'll love it."
1952,5,"This Ep shows one of musics most prolific bands at thier very best and for Belle and Sebastian thats saying alot. The brilient opener for which the Ep is named , must be one of the 90's best songs. And the superb closing track  SLow Graffiti will convince you that Belle and Sebastian are the best of  the best even if you didn't believe it before. What lies between these two  songs are classic  Belle an Sebastian tracks. A great follow up to The Boy  with Arap Strap, but could also fit in nicely with If Your Feeling Sinister  or any of the 97 Eps. Goes great with a cup of tea."
1953,5,"You don't just listen to this stuff... it insinuates itself into the grey area between your ears,  and then refuses to leave...  Haunting.  Think of it as the musical equivilent to &quot;The Raven&quot;.<br />There is a scene  in &quot;I.F. Stone's Weekly&quot; which captures an intensely beautiful  version of &quot;Kyrie&quot;,  sung by a military choir.  As their voices  swell,  the film cuts to stock footage of a  Vietnamese hamlet in the  process of being napalmed.  As the somber and extraordinary music crests  one sees the explosions from the vantage point of the helicopters.  It is  simultaneously a stunning and horrific vision - the horror of which is  underlined by the sombre liturgical score.<br />This CD is a lot like that.  &quot;Summoning of the Muse&quot; and &quot;Persephone&quot; in particular  give rise to a sense of foreboding which stays with you,  (and probably  makes you insufferable to everyone else),  for the rest of the day.  If you  suffer from chronic depression,  then you probably should give this CD a  pass,  and try out some Delta Blues.<br />Otherwise,  find a dark and drafty  room, light the candles and incense,  throw on the CD,  pick up Poe or  Kafka,  and let 'er rip."
1954,5,I absolutely ADORE the 'Ladies and this has to be their greatest album. Grade 9 cracks me up every time I hear it! Their music can be touching and sweet or fun and playful...100% pure musical genius at work here!! :D
1955,5,"Performed in concert with avant-guarde ballet artist Michael Clarke, this CD was very ahead of it's time. Mark E. Smith gives one of his best performances of his life giving the audience great music, lyrics that make  you think and some great political and historic references. Listen to it a  few times, and you can't stop..."
1956,4,"I heard &quot;Nothingman&quot; this a.m. on my way to work. Brought back memories of their concert @ The Forum in L.A. They are the ultimate band to see live! The clearity of the music and Eddie's voice are captured nicely  on this recording. It's refreshing to hear the crowd. Opposed to being  drownd out like a lot of live c.d.'s I've heard.

1957,5,"This album was cut before ICP became completely insane and hard-core.  Nevertheless, it offers a different, darker, and more thoughtful perspective of their music.  Every bit as good as the following two joker's  cards, it has that rare musical quality only the clowns possess.  Bring it  on!!!!!"
1958,5,"Karen's wonderful voice can't be denied &amp; her early death must have contributed mightily to all the warm &amp; fuzzy feelings people feel about her life's contribution to our everyday, humdrum lives.  It seems society  demands that its heroes (heroines) suffer as a prerequisite for greatness.  Maybe it's a blessing that she died early -- &quot;no way&quot; she, or any  human, could have &quot;topped&quot; what she gave us in her short  life.<br />Most good things in life seem to be a COMBINATION of things.  For  the Carpenters, Karen's brother Richard contributed immensely to the sheer  &quot;prettiness&quot; of their music &amp; sound.  Christmas is a comin'  &amp; every Christmas I listened to their Christmas Portrait album over  &amp; over.  Their Christmas music is just absolutely top-notch.  A human  being can't expect more than what the Carpenters gave us. <br />Enjoy.  Life  is short.  Enjoy.<br />Alan T. Matsuda in Honolulu, Hawaii USA"
1959,5,"I bought this CD while vacationing in Barcelona at the recommendation of a  salesclerk.  She was right on - the CD is fabulous. In her words, its  sencillo y suave, simple and smooth.It's a perfect Sunday morning CD. I am  a Spanish teacher and found it easy to understand - I would highly  recommend it to others!!"
1960,5,"Caf Noir's music is eclecticism at its best. The band's music is esoteric and eccentric--and at the same time, it's exciting and inviting. With roots in Django Reinhardt's swing, the Austin, Texas, group has pushed the limits of Gypsy jazz. The Waltz King features moody soundscapes, galloping waltzes, and romantic ballads, some of which are played in a humorous vein. Several songs feature vocals that are over the top, but all in all, this CD is an innovative opera, the pieces flowing--and at times, crashing--into each other."
1961,5,"there is no way to describe the music on this record! you will never get tired of it! the paulse pounding rhythm attacks the very seams of belief. the song, &quot;a people's history of the unithed states&quot; is their best yet. i encourage all to buy this political master piece!"
1962,3,"Snow's new CD is entertaining, but lacking in any musical perspective.  What she tends to do is to take a song and to slow it down so that the listener loses the melody.  Also, she has developed a habit of inserting high notes or squealing yelps into a song, apparently to show her emotion.  The 2 big remakes, Rocking Pneumonia and Joplin's Take a Piece of My Heart, are perhaps the most engaging songs on the CD.  Unfortunately, Snow sounds as if she is merely walking through the tracks, and these fun songs just don't sound like much fun."
1963,5,"For any fan of gothic/ambient music, this cd is a must-have. This collection of the best of Sisters of Mercy is over all too soon, and is a wonderful introduction to the Sisters, or to Gothic music in general."
