3,4,good
4,5,"Just as I expected, love the cd"
5,5,thanks
6,5,"This CD is all the evidence you need to claim Alison Moyet deserved to have more recognition in the United States. While undoubtedly influenced by classic soul singers, she is never imitative.  Moyet has a style and voice all her own.  The songs allow her to show her range and the depth of her unique talent."
7,5,These are just great to listen too!
8,4,nice
9,5,"Hilarious, hilarious, hilarious."
10,4,no burton but the guess who flavor.anything with kurt winter in it is priceless.fans don't fear this.great songs.
11,5,"Felt the need to feel a tangible cd, not another download"
12,5,love train
13,5,"Oh yes, this was worth the wait.  Just what a fan expects from Alan Jackson.  Great variety of different types of songs."
14,5,"Wow, I got this CD a week ago and haven't taken it out of my stereo yet.  What a powerful disc and David Coverdale and new crew just ROCKS.  From the drumming, bass and guitars, you need to crank it above 10.  The DVD is mind blowing as the videos are as powerful to watch and hear......."
15,5,"love Jill Scott could not wait for this. Love this CD and Wild Cookie Yes!!, Back Together, Can't wait great"
16,5,"Great Music. The more you listen, the more you get out of it. This album would be career defining for some acts. The Foo Fighters make it look too easy. They just keep getting better. From beginning to end you can't go wrong, this is why albums remain the way to experience music."
17,5,"Argentinian tenor Ra&uacute;l Gim&eacute;nez is now in his early sixties and presumably somewhat less active than when he recorded three operatic recitals for Nimbus between 1987 and 1991. Although he has made some excellent Rossini recordings and sung in the principal operatic venues, he has perhaps never achieved the fame he deserved of the kind enjoyed by his successor Juan Diego Fl&oacute;rez. Their voices are certainly comparable but Gim&eacute;nez has a slightly weightier, duskier quality. It is nonetheless essentially of the light, flexible, high-flying lirico-spinto variety, ideally suited to Mozart, Rossini and bel canto roles. His tone is slightly tight but very even in emission, invariably maintaining smooth legato; he displays an extraordinary subtle command over colour, dynamics and the messa di voce. He has a trill and great florid capability in executing coloratura divisions; apart from the occasional squeezed top note is singing evinces virtually no technical flaws and he is mercifully free of the dreaded aspirates with too many would-be Rossini tenors mar the line. I much prefer him to his almost exact contemporary, the Mexican tenor Francisco Araiza, who also specialised in Mozart and Rossini but to my ears had a much more constricted sound; amongst the modern tenors who rivals him for ease and beauty in this repertoire are Fl&oacute;rez, Lawrence Brownlee, Colin Lee and Barry Banks; he is that good.<br /><br />This Mozart album presents arias spanning the composer’s life from eighteen years old to the year of his premature death and brings to mind recordings by the greatest exponents of this music; comparisons with tenors such as Dermota, Simoneau, Wunderlich and Burrows, are by no means inappropriate. My only reservation is that both “Il mio tesoro” and “Un aura amoroso” are taken rather too briskly to permit them to breathe and they are to some extent robbed of the languorous sensuality inherent in the music. Otherwise, this is Mozart singing of the utmost refinement and sensibility. It is good to have the three rarer items of two arias from earlier operas and the concert piece and I once again note Gim&eacute;nez’ ability to encompass the impassioned, declamatory mode of  “Se all’impero” and the rapt poise of “Dies Bildnis”,  both of which are demanded of the complete Mozart singer. For this final album he has the expert support of the Covent Garden orchestra in first rate sound.<br /><br />[This review also posted on the MusicWeb International website]sibility.

19,5,Great example to show why Pink Floyd are masters in what they do!
20,5,Two of my favorite entertainers!  It's a Long Story: My Life explained a lot about this album and its title.  Great job Merle and Willie.  Thank you joining forces on this album.  Couldn't get any better than this!

25,5,Out freakin standing love this app
26,4,"In early 2004, I remember first hearing &#34;Somebody Told Me&#34; followed quickly by &#34;Mr. Brightside&#34;. I bought &#34;Hot Fuss&#34; and thought at that time how well the band reminded me of the best of the 1980's New Wave movement that I grew up on as an impressionable kid. I always felt that &#34;Hot Fuss&#34; didn't get enough airplay. There were so many good songs, memorable songs, that didn't get their fair shot at top 40 radio back then. I was hooked, and I've bought every Killers release as well as both of Brandon Flowers' albums.<br /><br />Personally, I feel that, unlike, say, Phil Collins, or Peter Cetera, Brandon Flowers is better suited to The Killers than he is as a solo artist. With one caveat: Phil Collins' first two solo projects, 1981's &#34;Face Value&#34; and 1982's &#34;Hello, I Must Be Going&#34; are not his best works. They have some really great songs, but they are not, as a whole experience, his best albums. Brandon Flowers, thus far, is more like David Lee Roth, or Mark Knopfler--solid, but just missing what they had in their own respective bands. So, here is Brandon Flowers' second solo album &#34;The Desired Effect&#34; which, right out of the gate, received critical accolades. I'm not so sure about that, as there are some songs here that begin to annoy after repeated listens. My biggest annoyance/beef is with &#34;I Can Change&#34;. There was absolutely no reason to use Bronski Beat's 1984 gay independence anthem &#34;Smalltown Boy&#34; on a song like &#34;I Can Change&#34; which is the exact opposite of being who you are, and instead trying to be what you think someone else wants you to be. Irritating, especially upon repeated listens. Next up on the annoyance scale is &#34;Diggin' Up The Heart&#34;. At first, I thought why does this song sound so familiar, and then it came to me--it is a dead ringer for the Electric Light Orchestra's 1983 hit &#34;Rock And Roll Is King&#34;. Irritating upon repeated listens, too. The other two tracks that are bothersome after awhile are &#34;Untangled Love&#34; and &#34;Still Want You&#34;.<br /><br />The best tracks here are &#34;Dreams Come True&#34;, &#34;Between Me And You&#34;, &#34;Never Get You Right&#34; and &#34;The Way It's Always Been&#34;. These four tracks strike the range of emotions, are well written, and have the best melodies here. Special mention goes to &#34;Can't Deny My Love&#34; and &#34;Lonely Town&#34;.<br /><br />So, slightly more than half the songs here are strong, with about four that aren't. But, overall, I liked the album. It grew on me. At first I wasn't sure, especially since I had just listened to all of The Killers and Brandon's solo debut. There is an element to Flowers that screams I want to be king of the world. I feel he tries to swing for home runs every time he makes music, and I still don't feel he's an entirely original artist. He is still heavily copying what has come before without doing something new with it. I can't recommend producers because he's already worked with quite a few I would suggest. Time will tell if solo Flowers' material will hit the big time or not, but I guarantee that &#34;The Desired Effect&#34; isn't it.<br /><br />Here's how &#34;The Desired Effect&#34; compares to Flowers' previous work:<br /><br />The Killers:<br />2004 Hot Fuss: Four Stars<br />2006 Sam's Town: Three and a Half Stars<br />2008 Day & Age: Three and a Half Stars<br />2012 Battle Born: Four Stars<br /><br />Brandon Flowers:<br />2010 Flamingo: Three Stars<br />2015 The Desired Effect: Three and a Half Starsracks that are bothersome after awhile are &#34;Untangled Love&#34; and &#34;Still Want You&#34;.<br /><br />The best tracks here are &#34;Dreams Come True&#34;, &#34;Between Me And You&#34;, &#34;Never Get You Right&#34; and &#34;The Way It's Always Been&#34;.

27,4,"In 1976, John \\""Juney\\"" Garrett and Richard Parker launched Ju-Par Records in Detroit and immediately arranged for distribution to be handled by the giant Motown empire, an association that lasted through 3 albums and a couple of singles before ceasing the arrangement.<br /><br />The single covered here was by the studio group The Ju-Par Universal Orchestra, assembled by Garrett and Parker, and consisting of: guitarist Phil Upchurch (who had a 1961 # 29 Billboard Pop Hot 100 hit with You Can't Sit Down, Part 2 as The Philip Upchurch Combo for the small Boyd label), trumpeters Art Hayle and Murray Watson, tenor/baritone saxophonist Ken Soderdlom, flutist Rich Rudoll, trombonist Ralph Craig, bassist Lou Satterfield, keyboardist (and producer-arranger) Dick Boyell, percussionist Derf Walker, drummer Quinton Joseph, and vocalists Kitty and Vivian Haywood and Bonnie Herman.<br /><br />In June-July 1977, the A-side, Funky Music, topped out at # 32 R&B and # 101 Billboard Pop Hot 100 as Ju-Par 8002 b/w Time. Short on lyrics, it most definitely is funky, but personally, I think if the Djs had flipped it over now and then, the B-side, Time, would have become a much bigger hit for the group.<br /><br />Both sides were also part of their only album, Moove & Grooves which, in 2005, was reformatted for CD by Traffic Entertainment Group so completists hits collectors looking for those sides in CD format will find them there."
28,5,very satisfied with service and product!
29,4,"This is a great CD (especially to listen to while walking). I also bought the DVD which is amazing; however, not all of the songs performed on the DVD are on the CD. I had never heard of David Garrett until I saw The Devil's Violinist and was immediately hooked. He is fantastic and so gorgeous!  Get the DVD also......you will love it, but be sure to turn on the English subtitles as he speaks only German while talking to the audience. I also purchased Legacy and Garrett vs Paganini - both great."
30,3,Bought for daughter.  She likes it.
31,4,"The sound recording is not the greatest. But I'm a Brainin- fan, Levi-Minzi has moved forward since the seventies-period of taking all works extremely slow vs a top-down, thoughtful approach."
32,5,great
33,5,Meets all expectations...
34,5,gift
35,2,"If it a rating just for the songs, I'd say 3, 3.5 stars.  However, for the whole CD package, it's a 2 star.  The songs are more accessible than typical Minus 5, which is sometimes pleasing, but sometimes you're hoping for the oddness of &#34;gun&#34; or &#34;down with wilco&#34;.<br /><br />A big, big factor that pulls the rating down is the recording quality....or lack thereof.  I'm cool with burying the vocal down in the mix.  Fine by me.  The poor recording issue the ever-present tinny sound, especially on drums & at times vocals & guitar.  Much of the treble here is an annoying, muddles buzz (not distortion, just lack of definition).  This is poorly produced audio.  For this alone, I'll probably donate it to Goodwill.  I simply don't go back to such poor recordings.<br /><br />The other factor pulling the rating down is not lyrics.  I typically like how Scott writes & would like them handy here.  Plus, for 15 bucks, it wouldn't kill them to put in a 4 or 8 page booklet."
36,4,"Doesn't feel like you're listening to Mumford & Sons, very different from their last album."
37,5,great
38,5,"This guy is new for me, and he sends out a very positive message. The tune, &#34;Sweetest Life&#34; is my favorite, but more than half of the songs are real good. He also talks out his philosophy of reggae music between a few of the tracks. My niece who also likes reggae music enjoys listening to BUSY SIGNAL, also."
39,5,Great CD. Love the rendition of &#34;Christ the Lord is risen today&#34; on the last track.
40,5,Excellent!
41,5,Great  cd.
42,5,"This is an excellent CD/DVD Combo! Alejandro performs one of his best nights in this concert, and the musicians are just great!"
43,5,This is a wonderful album I had a previous copy but it was damaged. If your a parent of an infant or toddler you'll find this album is magical. I've played it with all three of my kids when they are crying and cranky and it soothes them almost instantly.
44,5,Excellent product and service if you like metal with a punk rock attitude this album is for you. I love it. Glenn Danzig has an awesome and beautiful voice. This was a really great lineup in the early days of the misfits. I highly recommend this to all metal fans.

46,5,En Vogue is a very good 90's R&B group & this album sounds awesome i would buy from this seller again :}
47,3,"I have been looking for newer period instrument/performance practices recordings of Gabrieli's music from San Marco.  So far, this disc - though very well recorded and with ample skill shown by period instrumentalists and singers - just fails to satisfy.  I have McCreesh, and several others.  The practice of one singer per part and the inclusion of super long solo pieces just does not do it for me.  I was hoping for some choral singing that would be really full - not for hordes of singers - but somewhere between this and the old E Power Biggs, Greg Smith recording.  I guess I am out of touch with the current trends in scholarship, but this recording just bores me. I am not saying &#34;dont buy this&#34; - others here obviously love this recording.  It is just not what I was hoping for."
48,5,thanks
49,5,great cd
50,5,Very worshipful music!  I love this CD!
51,5,"Knappertsbusch, Klemperer, Celibidache and now - Cobra! I have recently discovered this great musician - A masterly performer!  Music style, levels of profundity and a unique orchestral balance/sonority...<br /><br />Nasty comments are comic, like the punch-line of a joke, right? As Cobra says in his interviews: “Any record sound is a sample… If the recording source is real, it becomes a sample, if it is a sampled real source, it remains a sample… Only the experience of a live performance is “real”.<br /><br />Listen by yourself on free streaming as I did and then decide…"
52,5,"Truly  an gospel marvel, to listen to and enjoy!!"
53,5,My favorite Hillsong album without question.
54,5,"Love these songs,  my comfort food of music"
55,5,really good job
56,5,Another example of not knowing this was ever released. Found videos on Youtube whcih led me to this purchase. A must have for Rodgers fans.
57,5,"I have seen these movies dozens of times, they are some of my favorites, but, I never realized there was a soundtrack available....very happy to have stumbled upon it....listen to it in my car, and can't help but love it! Especially the Antonio Banderas/Los Lobos tune.....orale!!"
58,5,enjoying this CD
59,3,"OK, not their best, but I still wanted it just because it's Cameo... A gr8 remake of Slave's &#34;Slide&#34; though.......<br />This one from 1994, but it's predecessor, 1992's &#34;Emotional Violence&#34; is a must-have for any fan of funk music....... Though it has a lot of hip-hop influenced songs and might not be what you're used 2 from Cameo, the funk element is still there, but &#34;Emotional Violence&#34; is not EZ 2 find..........."
60,5,"Oh my gosh.....one of his best.  I've listened to this CD many, many times - I never tire of listening to his masterful voice.<br />leighanne"
61,5,"I have been a fan of Boys Noize for awhile and this is a great album.  My only disappointment is not as many lyrics as I'd prefer, because I really like it when there are vocal samples on Boys Noize tracks.  Nonetheless, it's great from beginning to end and even the Snoop track works.  Somehow!"
62,5,hail to saxon! great cd/dvd combo from one of england's best metal bands! a must have for all metalheads! fast shipping!
63,5,Great composer and great performances!
64,3,"This is the 2nd time I have purchased a NOW CD which does not have the name of the album or song tracks names imbedded in the CD, the other one was the NOW 52 album, previous versions always had it. Tried inserting the CD into multiple players just to make sure it was not my machine.  Has NOW decided to cut corners on its duplication? If it has, this is just plain annoying."
65,2,wish I'd heard it before I purchased
66,4,"The music was fine, however it did not arrive as promised and in fact didn't arrive until after Christmas"
67,4,I've heard better
68,5,Perfect condition and I love it!
69,2,"Did not hit the mark. Daft Punk and Paul Williams are not even in the same music format. The only saving grace for this album is Pharrell's  Get Lucky and Niles Rodger's Give Life back to music. I actually have some of Daft Punks albums, Some of these sounds need to be reworked and more melodious."
70,5,EXCELLENT!
71,5,she delivered.
72,5,i love the cd
73,5,"item better than described, thanks it made my nephew very happy."
74,5,awesome
75,1,bad bad malo
76,5,"The Band Apollo's new EP takes the listener on a journey through nostalgic pop songs like 'Summer Song' and 'Eyes Wide', to hard rock anthems 'Blood Sweat Fame and 'She Knows', delivering an eclectic, catchy, hi-fidelity record. All 6 tracks on this outstanding CD are hit singles...only a matter of time until you hear these guys on radio stations all across the world."
77,5,great..had one before but it got stolen
78,5,In my opinion this album out of all the pit bull albums was the best
79,5,This is a wonderful CD. This group is unbelievable and I can't get enough of their music.
80,5,"Great show!  Saw it in NYC last summer.<br />Great cast recording!<br />Granted it wasn't an &#34;original score,&#34; but who cares.  It didn't get nominated for hardly any Tonys anyway, so time to move on.<br />Anyone who knows Woody knows that this is what he does in his movies anyway.<br />He uses standards to accentuate the time period and the stories involved in his movies.<br />And it worked for this show, making it a thoroughly entertaining evening in the theater.<br />For those who have issues with the music being unoriginal, fuggedaboutit……it didn't get nominated for best musical so move on.  Don't worry about it.<br />Accept it for what it is, a great show with some great music and awesome performances."
81,5,My 5-year-old loves the songs on the second CD at least as well as the songs from the actual movie. We love it!
82,5,awesome
83,3,"I love and know just about every song that Andrae Crouch puts out--but he got me on this one.  There are very few songs that I remember and like on this &#34;best of Andrae&#34; CD.  I was very disappointed, and rarely play it."

87,5,"If there was one band I could have been in in the Seventies, this is it. Eagles was the best Country Rock Band in the USA. It's hard to believe that they actually were backup singer for Linda Ronstadt. If anyone is thinking about buying the Greatest Hits 2 They need to buy the Eagles, their Greatest Hits Volume 1. This cd was digitally remastered  for better sound quality. It's a 5 star buy."
88,4,Sean did it again...amazing!
89,5,"This artist doesn't just HAVE a fascinating life experience, background and environment to draw from - he actually takes full advantage in subtle and not-so-subtle ways to craft an amazingly dynamic work."
90,4,Zappa- from all i discern about him from all sources exluding his music he was passionatly concerned about many issues but he/that doesnt come across clear or serious or even understandable in his music. It seems like a genius full of contempt for evil & wrong doing but he knew it would be dangerous to be too precise about it on record. Well- they didnt even tolerate his effort in a veiled fashion did they. Hes been long ago taken out of the way.
91,5,Raised on Star Wars :)

99,5,"She was undoubtedly &#34;The VOICE&#34;. This compilation and DVD proves it. Although she has had better live performances, this portrays popular live shows she has sung over the years. There will never be a singer that sings with so much emotion, emotes complete class, and lives up to her caliber. She is someone who has had a long career, but few recorded songs, albums and performances. You see that every time she performs she gives it her all. There are some performances on this CD/DVD I would have changed because they really don't show the range of how talented she really is. I don't know how the Whitney Houston estate didn't provide better quality video in the DVD and why they didn't have a live version of &#34;I look to you&#34; on as well. Even her performance on Oprah wasn't as good as the AMA performance. Yes this is Whitney Houston Live, but definitely not her greatest performance, but rather her most popular ones.<br /><br />I any case this is an amazing addition to any music condensers collection, and I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates the core of what music can do."

103,5,OK if you know the difference between Marshall mother's and slim shady OK in the Marshall mother's lp 2 he saying he don't want just be king he wants more then being king he wants to be rap god he want to be the best then all these rappers and he wants to destroy all these rappers now shady xv is slim shady and shady is back in the shady xv slim shady is almost the something but he still wants to be god and the older he gets the better rapper he becomes and the legend of angry blonde is back and we miss that blonde because slim shady don't want to destroy like Marshall slim shady wants to kill rappers mostly everybody and slim shady got out from the cage from the video monster
104,5,"I recently purchased this CD and it is Awesome, I love it ! I love every song on this CD and that rarely happens for me. I'm glad to see that he's doing pretty good for himself in spite of the fact that he was cheated out of part of his brother's inheritance by someone who's not even blood related. Keep up the good work Leon, I look forward to buying your next album !"
105,3,"Seeing all of the complaints about quality control made me open up all of the singles and albums from the first two batches of releases. Sure enough, out of 12 singles, 11 had multiple dimples and ripples, and two had scratches to boot. Only Purgatory was flawless. The 6 albums are flawless - but there is no way the last two albums are going to fit. I'm in the US but had to order the European version of the box as Amazon US screwed me over. I ordered the day the release was announced and waited patiently and the day of release Amazon suddenly didn't have a release date. So, I panicked and ordered form Amazon UK. I watched DHL's tracking as they tried to deliver my order several times in Germany.. lol. Finally after 21 days it showed up in a completely smashed and destroyed shipping box. I was devastated. But upon opening the box set was amazingly unscathed - even though it only had a measly strip of packing paper thrown in with it. So I load the first six releases up and they barely fit... Now I see the US version will actually house all 8. So, do I send this set back to Amazon UK and take a chance with the US version? Or will Maiden step up and make this right?"
106,5,admire Jimmy's music nice collection

122,5,"Energetic, imaginative and melodic. The tuness are captivating"
123,5,"One of her best works , up there with &#34; Dakshina &#34; , &#34; Love is space &#34; , &#34; The Essence &#34; and her other simply wonderful cd's , great seller , fast service ."
124,5,"As a lifelong Weird Al fan, I was disappointed when I recently realized I owned most of his older albums on cassette only. I've recently taken to rectifying this, one CD at a time. &#34;Alapalooza&#34; was just as enjoyable now as it was back in the days of listening to it on my Walkman. &#34;Jurassic Park,&#34; &#34;Traffic Jam,&#34; &#34;Frank's 2000-inch TV,&#34; and of course &#34;Bohemian Polka&#34; are still some of my favorite songs by him. I like that Amazon includes the digital album for free with most of these purchases as well- that's a nice touch.  If you haven't checked out Al's stuff, or if you're only familiar with his newest one, &#34;Mandatory Fun,&#34; do yourself a favor and pick up one of these albums pronto!"
125,5,"Amabis<br />\\""Trabalhos Carnivoros\\""<br />(Mais Um Discos, 2014)<br />. . . . .<br /><br />Subtle, textured, sometimes brooding, downtempo indie-pop from Brazilian rocker Gui Amabis, known to a few non-Brazilians as the brother of [[ASIN:B000QZSYSE Rica Amabis]], who put out an album several years ago that got wide, global distribution.  Like his sister, Gui is a little hard to pinpoint stylistically, though I suppose this album falls roughly in the same intellectual, artsy style as post- lo-fi \\""math rockers\\"" such as Giant Sand, et. al. -- or if we wanted to use a Brazilian frame of reference, there's also similarity to some of Caetano Veloso's more cerebral, poetic work. It's a highly listenable album with several beautiful passages and though it gets kind of dour and downcast towards the end, Amabis never lapses into the showy, theatrical avant posturing of artists such as Arnaldo Antunes or Arto Lindsay -- this is a more earnest, organic album, with a rich palatte both musically and emotionally.  Definitely worth a spin! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide To Brazilian Music)"
126,5,Not their best but still has some good songs
127,5,A Wonderful gift to myself.  This is not only a CD it is audio DVD.  It plays beautiful Christmas music and displays Thomas Kinkade's wonderful paintings.
128,5,She's great!
129,5,ottimo!
130,5,good
131,3,"This is a continuation of John McEuen's two string wizard albums.  This cd puts the guitar out front more.  John can play just about any string instrument I think.  But he is probably best know as a banjo player,  Or at lest when he plays lead.  All these songs are good.  with my favorites being Gypsy Knights which he opens the cd with then closes it with a reprise of it also.  This cd is pretty good."
132,5,Enjoying the CD
133,3,I got the four songs I wanted.
134,5,"I love this cd, glad I bought it"
135,5,It's KEM People! 'nuff said
136,5,Maravillos viaje al pasado.Varias de esas canciones me obligaron a recordar mis dias en Guatemala. Una joya musical.
137,3,"This is not actually a review of this product, but is a report of incorrect metadata... And there doesn't appear to be anywhere else to report this.<br /><br />This album is mislabeled as &#34;Simple Minds&#34; -- It should be &#34;Mathew Sweet&#34;.<br /><br />Furthermore, it's not &#34;Hypnotised C.D. Box&#34;, it's the &#34;Superdeformed EP of Girlfriend&#34;."
138,5,Great Cd
139,5,It is so great to hear the big band tradition alive and well in America ! Bill Warfield's Big Band is swinging on all cylinders and the great Randy Brecker is sounding better than ever ! If you love Big Band Jazz you will definitely love this one !
140,5,Loved it! favorite Album
141,1,"The theme song is great, but the rest is just ok."
142,5,"SACD layer is outstanding. Great disk, classic sounds."
143,5,JUST WHAT I WANTED<br />THIS CD IS SO SO<br />NICE CAN REALLY<br />CHILL ON THESES GROOVES.
144,5,"Love this show, I think it is David Yasbek's best of his stuff so far. The cast was awesome and I was bummed that more people didn't get a chance to find out how appealing it was. Laura Binanti was AMAZING. I saw it 3 times on Broadway. I wish someone would do it in Los Angeles."
145,3,Fun.
146,4,It arrived very quickly and it was just what I expected.
147,5,Had all these albums years ago and not listened to them as I have not had a turntable for decades!!  For some reason I had a hankering to listen to them and fount this set.  I love it and have been listening to the set non stop. I would recommend this....and a great price too.
148,1,OMG THIS ISNT WHAT I WANTED IT ONLY HAS TO SONGS WHETE CAN I BIY THE RIGHT ONE?????
149,4,This is a very special musician from Poland.<br />I like his romantic ballads from the way back.<br />It is a pretty good music but not for everyone.
150,4,Good songs.
151,5,This is my favorite. Every single song!!
152,5,I personally love this album. Dio shouldve really gotten more credit than he recieved. 'Shivers' is a personal favorite. I really recommend this album!!!!
153,5,"Soothing, comforting, and just plain inspirational!"
154,5,Great CD!
155,4,"They did a good job of selecting the best of, happy I purchased it."
156,5,As described!
157,5,very beautiful CD
158,3,This ex NBA star can really sing.
159,5,Love this group.  We heard them when we were on vacation in Florida several years ago and I list to this CD in my car all the time.
160,5,The Ashford & Simpson collection songs are excellent
161,5,Item was as advertised
162,5,"The album is truly a snapshot of the turbulence of the times, as was the movie."
163,5,"This was a long time coming and it was worth the wait!This album shows the myriad of Dennys'  gifts.From the slow beautifulNorthstar and the Ravens to the mind blowing John the Gun,this is the best stuff Sandy did on her own.(Don't forget Faiport).saltydog."
164,5,my hubby loves miranda
165,3,"Let me qualify myself before going on record to say Clockwork Angels is the weakest RUSH album ever:  i am a huge fan of the majority of Rush's original material... I love them all from Working Man to Workin Them Angels.<br /><br />Rush almost always put out some pretty cheeky material - Caress Of Steel's Lord Of the Rings lyrics are almost embarrasing, especially since it became such a huge franchise.  Notice that in contrast, led zep songs like \\""ramble on\\"" which quotes LORD OF THE RINGS word for word are still cool today.<br /><br />I love early Rush (first 4 albums), overly prog rush (next 4 albums), keyboard rush - which oddly enough is my favorite era - i'm talking Signals, Power Windows, and Grace Under Pressure... The only completely unredeemable Rush albums are Presto and Roll The Bones (anybody interested should know that i'm ready for a fight if anybody disagrees with me).  Even 90's Rush was great.. I still think TEST FOR ECHO is the last great Rush album.  (vapor trails was the beginning of the end for Geddy's voice, snakes and arrows is mostly brilliant but has a bit of poor vocals from Geddy)<br /><br />Geddy Lee can still hit most of the high notes with his voice.. But he shouldn't even try because his voice sounds reeally strange and besides the weird tones, he makes the weirdest note choices and uses a weird cadence that just doesn't satisfy me.  SNAKES AND ARROWS LIVE is all tuned down at least a half-step if not more, yet he still sounhds like he's straining.<br /><br />My genius idea for Rush is to get a bad ass female singer and continue as a 4-piece.<br /><br />Geddy Lee's bass playing throughout Clockwork Angels, on the other hand, is spry and energetic as ever before.  The entire band (geddy, alex, and neil) plays with an intensity and originality that has been missing from Rush for a long time.  People are trying to learn the bass line from Headlong Flight and there's no denying that most of this long album's riffing would exhaust anyone trying to master a particular part of a song.  I mean, it's been a long time since people are talking about riffs from a new rush album, and believe me people are talking about these riffs.<br /><br />Alex just rips it up all throughout the album.. Some of his best solos since the 80's, honestly.  He's still getting better and that's just scary.<br /><br />When i first heard Caravan and realized Rush was going back to riff rock, i was super pumped.<br />.. But honestly Geddy's voice ruins it.  You know that part in Carnies where he goes \\""flint and stee-ee-eel\\"" and goes up to that uncomfortable note.  He's guilty of making poor choices throughout a very long album that sadly adds to the painful truth.. Geddy Lee is \\""losing it\\"".  Sadly ironic.  STILL a huge Rush fan!  Peace.ing to master a particular part of a song.

166,4,"I own everything Boston has ever released.  I played the first Boston album on my record player until the grooves got so deep I could hear the the songs on the other side leak through.  Let's just say I am a fan but it doesn't mean I can't give a honest assessment of what Tom Scholz has created.  In my humble opinion this is a fantastic collection songs.  Does it sound exactly like the first album?  Hell no, that was 40 years ago, Tom has changed and so have the rest of us.  Does is sound like Boston?  Hell yes!  The album rocks my world on the way to and from work everyday and I can't get the songs out of my head ( a good thing).  I could go on and on about what I like about each song, but music is so personal we all have to make up our own minds.  All I can say is give it a chance, don't be the A.D.D. monkeys the internet has made us all, listen to it for a week.  I remember when Grand Illusion( Styx)came out, I hated it.  Then I gave it some time and realized it was incredible, good things sometimes take time to soak in.  That's all I can say.  FYI, Best Buy's version has a bonus track!  I just ordered it too!"
167,5,What else can you say about the ole' Mis Sig.  Probably one of the best bands of all time. Period.
168,5,"Best CD ever bought ! Music my sis T is a must listen for everyone, pure, clean music with a great message."
169,5,I cannot get over how great this album is!  His voice is just so soulful!  I could listen to him all day long!
170,5,"I bought this for my stepmother who is a huge Engelbert fan. She loves it. The album contains some of the best songs ever performed by Engelbert and many, many top name performers. The album was a long time coming, but the product was well worth the wait. Engelbert out did himself on this one, a true masterpiece."
171,4,"This group live up to it name the cd is not bad at all this good music I m buying from Amazon is a blessing and,The reason why I m buy all this music because I m professional a dj."
172,5,"I got this one as a freebie for buying three other used Cd's locally.  I just saw it there and saw Carter and plucked it right up. Read all the other reviews because they are (mostly...)right on! Why I missed Carlene all these years is beyond me. First of all there are like 20 tracks on this issue and not one bad one. Carlene - I don't get it why she has not gotten the attention because she deserves it. There is a definite \\""voice shadow\\"" of her mother and the Carter family female singers. She takes us on a wonderful effort that at times is a country, a little country rockin, a little country bluesy (kinda.) I fell In Love, Every Little Thing, Me and The Wildwood Rose, Sometimes, Love Like This and other fantastic tracks await you here - come one and all. My first Carlene CD but certainly not the last. This is not one of your country glitter queens like Shania, Taylor or others (no offense - I  love them, too) but this a country singer that sings like Loretta and all those good ole girls from back yonder days. Nuff said."
173,4,I read this is great for meditation. I have not had a chance to try it more than once due to drama  in the household. May this CD bring you peace.
174,5,I love the talent of Elvis Presley and especially like his gospel and romantic music. I feel blessed to listen to this great talent. Actually I have not purchased any CD of his that I did not like.
175,5,I love Donizetti and it doesn't get better than Sutherland and Pavarotti.  Too bad they are gone but at least their music lives on.
176,5,Great cd I love Eminem's music if you are a Eminem fan this is a must have or even if you just like rap
177,5,This is a lovely meditation. Humbling and energetic. Just makes you feel good about the world and about the people around you. Highly recommend it for busy lifestyles who need a morale/energetic boost now and then.
178,5,"Ray,you will be missed. I absolutely love Time! The song selections for this album are truly masterpieces! He does a remake of Take Back Your Old Love Letters which he originally recorded in the 60's and then again for Hall Of Fame Series. I am 29 years of age and own every single of Ray's vinyl albums on CD! I have been blind since birth and use a computer with speech. I love the real country music and this CD has a lot of that! I would love to hear from Ray Price fans, so you may email me anytime! I am really excited for his new album Beauty Is next month! Yea! I truly wish he was still with us. What a voice. I am so, so delighted I own all his vinyl albums. Anyone who would like any of them for free,let me know and I will be more than happy to help with CD's!<br /><br />countrydjmaheen@gmail.com"
179,5,This is an awkward and unusual work.  There is no better recording of the Rachmaninoff.  Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli's finest performance ever.
180,3,"This is a Great collection of Sinatra songs, has all the classics!  Just to bad the case was cracked in 3 areas, and a bit of a eye sore... But be bad shipping/handling....  Other then that, great music!"
181,4,"3rd album from Lansing, Michigan band—gutsy, garage/psych guitar rock<br /> with an authentic, raw & rootsy 60s feel that packs in plenty of energetic fun with melodic fuzz<br /> hooks and some strange diversions.  Similarities to the Urges, Thee Vicars, the Strange Boys,<br /> Muck and the Mires, the Seeds, “Pebbles” series bands."
182,5,We have a collection of Driving music for the freeways!  lol  Yep!  This one has the energy to keep on going!  :)
183,5,"This is another great TUM Records disc, my points:<br /><br />1) The instrument sounds are vivid - vibrant and full of life -, especially the bass is both \\""fluttering\\"" and woody (which both are, to me, signs of quality in that instrument). The drums sound sharp and have a highly defined contour, besides being no-nonsense and \\""earthy\\"". The saxophone and the flutes sound great, with the whole prism of tonal variety and levels of intensity covered.<br /><br />2) Juhani Aaltonen sounds so great, actually, in the very best parts more intense than anywhere I've ever heard of him. There is so much the spirit of \\""Coltrane in '65\\"" in the most aggressive gushes and flurries of notes that in those places it almost sounds like the Master of Tenor himself was playing with Aaltonen's sound!<br /><br />3) There is a variety between songs, but also an exceptional unity - mostly due to the bass and the drums - of the tracks. One Andrew Cyrille's composition breaks the mood a bit, but all other pieces are of the same style, with different moods but same \\""colours\\"". In some instances the bass plays too much of a pedal point/riff-oriented style, but still with enough chromatism and invention to not be too simple. The rhythm parts, in general, are skillful and highly cohesive, as you'd expect from musicians of this calibre.<br /><br />4) Despite the general unified spiritual state of the music, the intensity level of Juhani Aaltonen's playing varies, dividing the musical moments within and between the pieces into simpler and softer, and wilder and - I would say - more melodic[!] parts. Juhani seems to avoid more complex scales and chomaticism when he's playing slow, but comes into full storm of harmonic and melodic fury when gaining speed. That's his common trait, and part of the charm to those who know more of his work.<br /><br />SUMMARY: If you liked Coltrane in his late classic quartet period [=1965] you will definitely find _something_ to listen to in this record - if the lacking piano does not bother you. Also, if you could see yourself liking both the very skillfully played flute (with naturally good vibrato) and at times aggressive but always warm, consistently strong and intelligent yet melodic tone and style on the tenor saxophone with alternating moments of simpler, gentler melody and wild cascades of invention, as well as a great rhythm pair, you should consider bying this one!<br /><br />The package is good, but the the music even better. 4½ stars."
184,4,"I know i've gone on record here on amazon and busted the Police's and Sting's balls sometimes. But let me set the record straight- i don't hate them. In fact i like them. I just think that they're a bit overrated in proportion with their actual musical legacy. This collection is a good &#34;one-stop shop&#34; for obtaining all the hits. My favorites are : Spirits In A Material World, Can't Stand Losing You, Every Breathe You Take. There were a few tunes left off that I would've included although there more album cuts than hits (ie Canary In A Coalmine, Synchronicity 1 &2)"
185,4,"A. Krause described the flaws perfectly in his review. The studio crew must have felt they needed to tweak things but their knob-twiddling had the effect of spoiling the fine balance of the band.<br />The bass part for LSD carries much of the song structure and adds musical originality within the songs but it is lowered in the mix as if it was just playing root notes for the chords. The bass is one of the things that makes me smile (and sometimes laugh with pleasure) on their other recordings. I'm sad to say that's not the case here only because it is buried in the mix and largely lost.<br />Modern recording and mixing should be conveying the sparkle and thrill of LSD rather than throwing a towel over it.<br />I'm looking forward to seeing them live in March so I'll get my dose of their real music then.<br />In spite of my feelings about the recording, I still recommend it. This is an exciting band that deserves a wide audience and I will continue to listen to this CD though with a little regret."
186,5,"I already had a copy of this cd, however, from listening to it so many times it's scratched. Needed and new one and could only find on Amazon."
187,5,"What a great way to close a fantastic career....INNUENDO is the last album from QUEEN with their 4 original members, and it´s one of their BEST!!!!! I really like ALL the songs like the beautiful title track, HEADLONG, SHOW MUST GO ON and SLIGHTLY MAD.....QUEEN is without any doubt one of the best bands EVER, and what they create is pure music magic......WELL DONE, QUEEN!!!! This music will live forever!!!!!!"
188,5,We had the good fortune of being able to see a live performance of Wicked and really loved it.  This CD was very good in that it included some of the dialogue as well as the songs from the musical so you could actually get an overview of the whole musical just by listening to the CD.
189,5,This is a great album by two of the members of The Moody Blues.  Two incredible composers and musicians!  I will enjoy this for a long time to come.  The re-mastered CD sound is excellent!
190,5,"very fast delivery and cd's are awesome.<br />love the live dvd too, Garth and Trisha are very funny together too"
191,5,Arrived within an appropriate amount of time. It was carefully packed and arrived in perfect conditions. I absolutely love this vinyl and still cannot believe it is finally in my possession.
192,3,"It was okay - very easy listening, only play it in the car, and ok for background music<br />Would recommend"
193,5,It was a gift for my granddaughter (she asked for it) and she was delighted with it.  I would recommend this company.
194,5,"This is an all time great Christmas album, would recommend it to anyone who likes great music for the holidays."
195,5,I have always loved the Judds and this Christmas cd is the best. I play it every year and cant get enough.
196,5,My sister used to sing Tammy to me when I was little. so this is a birthday gift for her after 30 years.
197,4,Our daughter-in-law wanted this for her second son. She said it was less something different and she really liked the folksy music. I listened before I bought it just to get an idea. While it is different I found a couple others I liked better. But since she loved this we got it of course!!!!! And our little grandson will love it too!
198,5,"Daniel Barenboim is an amazing man and a wonderful pianist.  This CD is absolutely beautiful, and I would recommend it anyone who enjoys classical music."
199,5,This album is a pleasure to hear; the duets with more contemporary artists give reenergize the featured classic songs.<br />Love the spin given.
200,5,Bill Cosby is one of the greatest comedians of all time. Love it. His new cd/dvd is even more hilarious. Highly recommended.
201,1,there is one good song on the whole cd. the rest of the songs on the cd remind me of 80's hair metal. meh
202,4,i loved the movie and had to get the songs on it even though i already have them on various artists albums
203,4,"This 3-CD 64-track box set (CD 1 - tracks 1 to 22, CD 2 - tracks 23 to 43, CD 3 - tracks 44 to 64) will certainly please those seeking his U.K. hits with its excellent digitally-remastered sound and extensive liner notes sprinkled with vintage photos. But if you are a North American completist hits collector even this ambitious release will not fill the bill as it omits one Hot 100 entry here as well as one B-side.<br /><br />Born on November 30, 1936 in Coventry, but raised in Australia before returning to the U.K. at age 23, Ifield's most memorable hit by far was a cover of the Jimmy Dorsey 1942 entry I Remember You, which rose to # 1 in the U.K. in 1962 and, in North America, peaked at # 1 Adult Contemporary (AC) and # 5 Billboard Pop Hot 100 in October b/w I Listen To My Heart on Vee-Jay 457. What probably sold it more than anything else was the falsetto, which he used on all of his subsequent discs, even to the point of emulating the old Country star Elton Britt by breaking into a yodel here and there.<br /><br />He followed that with the immortal Hank Williams' Lovesick Blues, another # 1 in the U.K. but just missing the Top 40 in the U.S., topping off at # 44 Hot 100 in January 1963 b/w a cover of the Eddy Arnold hit, Anytime - the missing B-side - on Vee-Jay 477. That October he was back, this time with Capitol handling the releases, to take another oldie, I'm Confessin' (That I Love You) - a 1930 smash for both Guy Lombardo & His Royal Canadians and Rudy Vallee. to # 1 U.K. and # 16 AC/# 58 Hot 100 in North America b/w Waltzing Matilda (Capitol 5032) . His last North American charting single was, Please, a hit for Bing Crosby in 1932, which stalled at # 71 Hot 100 in January 1964 b/w Mule Train on Capitol 5089. They do not include the charted side in this 64-track set.<br /><br />Another U.K. # 1 for Ifield was his cover of the Gogi Grant 1956 hit The Wayward Wind, but in the U.S. the best it could do was a # 104 Hot 100 Bubble Under in January 1963 b/w I'm Smiling Now on Vee-Jay 499. His cover of the 1933 Ethel Waters hit Don't Blame Me made it to # 8 in the U.K. but in the U.S. its best was a January 1964 # 128 Hot 100 Bubble Under b/w a cover of George Olsen & His Orchestra's 1932 # 1 Say It Isn't So on Capitol 5134. His final flirtation with a Hot 100 hit in the U.S. came in May 1967 when his cover of the 1945 Tommy Dorsey hit You Came Along (From Out Of Nowhere) also Bubbled Under at # 132 on Hickory 1454 b/w Kaw-Liga (which isn't included here).<br /><br />While the man could certainly carry a nice tune, it seems his stage presence was wooden, as was his acting career which began -and ended - in 1965 with the Australian film Up Jumped A Swagman.<br /><br />A 5-star effort for U.K. fans, but for many North American-based collectors, not only do those missing sides knock it down to 4 stars, but 64 tracks is likely a bit more than most would want.Smiling Now on Vee-Jay 499.

204,5,"This album is definitely food for my soul, I can't seem to get it out of my car player, I enjoy the live instrumentation, neo soul sounds and she has meaning in her songs things that make a difference in your life."
205,5,CeCe is amazing. She knows how to deliver with such a beautiful voice. Heaven sent. Very inspirational. Thank you for this one CeCe. I've listened to this CD many times and am inspired anew each time I hear it.
206,5,"I grew up listening to Moms' while my grandparents play her records and we were sent bed, although we would hide and would listen to her. Moms' was truly the first &#34;Queen&#34; of comedy. Share Moms with the younger generation."
207,3,Don't care for Christian music but like some of this.  The lead singer has a nice voice.  Surprises even me.
208,5,"Absolutely fantastic album! Baptized in Filth was amazing... this may well trump that album. Catchy hooks, great balance of brutal but understandable lyrics. Don't let the cover or title fool you. This is a Christian band and kudus to these guys for having serious guts. This album gives a definitive answer to the naysayers that mock christian rock saying &#34;what does a christian sing rock/metal about - Jesus loving you? That's lame.&#34;<br /><br />The answer to that is: sometimes, and no it's not always lame.. but in general Christian rock/metal fills that gap in christian music between the worship songs the world thinks of when they think 'christian music' and that point where real life, real problems and real danger need to be conveyed. To those who mock christian metal saying &#34;you live in a fantasy world&#34; this album screams back the challenge 'You are the one not aware of the real world...open your eyes'... As Impending Doom puts it: &#34;If your soul was mine I would be terrified / I'd tear off the lids of your eyes / to make you watch and learn / the sins of your past have left you to burn in the hellhole / burn for what you've done&#34;  To everything there is a season and this is a great season of brutal, honest music but ultimately music filled with hope of salvation. It's hard to pick highlights when the whole album is amazing... I will say though that 'Hellhole' was stuck in my head for weeks. Try it, you won't be disappointed!!!"
209,5,It was a gift for my nephew.....he cried when he opened it.  He absolutely adored Donny Hathaway & had met his wife & daughter.
210,5,incredible new McCartney cd.  Definitely one of his best.  I've listened to it about 20 times so far and love it.  Not one bad song
211,5,"I live for this sort of blessed discovery. Jhene is fascinating and enthralling. With remnants of Frank Ocean, I hear this as one of the finest of the year. From the first single, \\""3:16 a.m.\\"" to \\""The Worst\\"" featuring a thought provoking flow by Kendrick Lamar. Jhene is said to be influenced by John & Yoko Lennon's \\""Bed Protest\\"", thus we have \\""Bed Peace\\"". The song that has me captivated me most is \\""Stay Ready\\"". I welcome challenging music of this nature. By the break, I am floating on the chord changes. There are sprinkles of what The Robert Glasper Experience offers. It is great to see \\""Sail Out\\"" topping iTunes R&B Album chart and I now understand why. It has stayed in the Top 5 since its release this summer........it is really a great blend of hip hop and R&B despite of it being on Def Jam. Of course, Def Jam today has only tangible relations to its origins as street hip hop from Hollis, Queens. It belongs on the overall chart, but, it seems unrealistic to place it in any confining genre. Regardless this is a celebratory experience that I welcome with glee for its innovation and thinking of it beyond boundaries. I have since invested in another \\""Unreleased\\"" CD by Jhene and there is a beautiful song \\""For My Brother\\"" dedicated to her brother who transitioned from cancer a couple of years ago.<br />Apparently Jhene is considered in some circles as part of \\""hipster R&B\\"" which sounds like a modern day version of neo-soul. With so many states finally passing medicinal mari laws. Right at the onset, she celebrates the wonders of a a vapor smoking machine. \\""Can I hit again, can I hit again\\""......, \\""Sail Out\\"" could be the campaign or theme songs capturing all the positives that altering your perception/environment can be an enthralling experience. Breaking up the mood is an uptempo, Motown/Pop Soul of \\""Let it Go\\"" for you to feel another side of her creativity.<br />The production is absolutely captivating and I found myself floating into another dimension of emotions and emotive expression.<br />There is nothing negative I could say about this album except it should be a full length album. Yet it will undoubtedly inspire the smart ones to seek out her other releases via Mixtapes and unreleased compilations."
212,5,More great work by a great band. Several favorite tracks but all are really good. I'm ready for the next CD.
213,5,"Although LaRue was not well known, this song is the textbook picture of what R&B/Soul was all about in the early 90s. Sophisticated, sleek production gives the simple melody an air of royalty and places Donnie's and Bobbi's vocals outside the margin of simple pop. Keyboard programming is done by the famous Jeff Lorber who helped skyrocket Karyn White to stardom. Overall, it's a song that could otherwise be considered cute, if it weren't for the stellar musicianship and production of everyone involved. While fans of their other work might miss the other two members, this song shows that LaRue could do just fine as a duo. Smooth, soulful, playful and had a catchy video as well. Anyone who is obsessed with mid-tempo R&B from the late 80s/early 90s will enjoy this."
214,1,Horrible!!!  Waste of money!!!  How can I get my money back???<br />I ordered three comedy CD's.  This was the worst by far.  It's a shame that this great comedian's name was affixed to this junk.
215,1,Loved Cornerstone but this ones long and boring<br />Go to Hooser Girl e.p. or Hey Man....Great Albums thanks but no thanks
216,4,"No question about it....Sheryl Crow is at her best when she's just trying to be....well, Sheryl Crow. Her style and sound has always benefited from a blending and melding of genres...a little pop here, a little rock there. Toss in some country for flavor, some R&B for spice. That's just who she is, and it's usually worked out well for her.<br />  However, starting with 2010's 100 MILES TO MEMPHIS, Crow seems set on concentrating on specific genres. The hollow soul of MEMPHIS fit her like her daddy's overcoat, coming across as forced and ill-advised.<br />  With FEELS LIKE HOME, her eighth studio album, she's now shifting to Country. (If one's to believe the press release, it was the only way she could get a new record deal after parting ways with A&M after almost 20 years. Really? REALLY???).<br />  Country has always played a big part in Crow's overall sound, so this should have been a natural segue. Sadly, that's just not the case. At it's worse, HOME sounds transparent and contrived, like it's pandering to the lowest common denominator (Sort of like a Carl's Jr. commercial!).<br />  At it's best, though, the album proves that this just isn't needed...tuneful, honest and organic, Crow's roots spring forth throughout all of those stronger moments. Sometimes subtlety and simplicity really are the best route to take!<br />  Case in point....the disc's opening cut, \\""Shotgun.\\"" Rather than being honest and real with us, Crow seems to be dishing out something she thinks others might expect from her, something that's \\""now\\"" and \\""hip\\"" on the Country charts. Wrong move. Cotton candy is light and fluffy and fun, but you can't make a steady diet out of it. The same can be said about \\""Shotgun.\\""<br />  Far better is \\""Easy\\"", the album's first single. With it's relaxed arrangement, lazy, loose vocal and sweet lyrics (I LOVE \\""Forget the beach, I'd rather be here with you/Playin' croquet/Okay/Maybe that's not true!\\""), the song just kind of tumbles out of the speakers, warming you like the sun on a late Summer day. Very nice!<br />  \\""Give It To Me\\"" starts off O.K., but by the time Crow gets to the chorus her vocal comes across as strained and over the top. By the bridge? Just waaaay too much. Nice backing vocal from Ashley Monroe, though. Gotta call this one a miss.<br />  Even worse is \\""We Oughta Be Drinkin'\\"". I know what Crow is trying to do here, but it just doesn't work....dull arrangements, mannered vocals and moronic lyrics don't become anyone. Crow is better ~ and smarter! ~ than this drivel. DEFINITELY a career low.<br />  On the flipside, we have the album's best cut up next. \\""Callin' Me When I'm Lonely\\"" is sheer pop perfection...you have an insanely tuneful arrangement, crisp instrumentation, a lovely lead vocal and thoughtful lyrics (\\""And that's just enough time for me/To figure out if I should stay or leave/But if I think it through/I ain't got nothing better to do\\""). Classic Crow!<br />  I love the \\""single mother\\"" story behind \\""Waterproof Mascara\\"", but I wish Crow had kept it real and true to her own life, vs. dressing it up with the whole \\""abandoned by a no-good cowpoke\\"" theme, something that's totally unnecessary. A good song that could have been even better.<br />  I also wish she'd taken things even further with \\""Crazy Ain't Original\\"" ~ there are some wonderful observations here (my favorite being \\""What everybody used to call a freak show/Well now we call it reality T.V.\\""), but I would have loved to have seen a bit more bite and attitude in both the vocal and arrangement. Still, one of my favorites!<br />  There's nothing deep or profound about \\""Nobody's Business\\"", but who cares? In the old days, this would have been called a great \\""album track\\"", and that's exactly what it is...catchy and fun, with a killer lead vocal, this is just a good time that adds to the overall vibe of the disc. Sweet!<br />  \\""Honesick\\"" is another winner. A delicate arrangement and gorgeous lyrics meld perfectly. But the true star here is Crow's stunninglead vocal, aided and abetted by Zac Brown's pitch-perfect harmony vocal. I swear, this is a master class in harmonizing! Breath-taking...simply breath-taking.<br />  \\""Homecoming Queen\\"" is another example of Crow at her best....you have a thoughtful, bittersweet story/song, understated instrumentation, an introspective lead vocal and killer lyrics (\\""Too bad life ain't a local parade/In your uncle's Corvette on a Saturday/With all the little girls waitin' on you to wave\\""). THIS is what we've come to expect from Sheryl Crow over the last two decades....honesty, with no extra trappings needed. Nuff said.<br />  \\""Best Of Times\\"" is fun enough, but after the one/two powerhouse punch of \\""Homesick\\"" and \\""Homecoming Queen\\"", it seems, well, a tad bit...amateurish. Nice harmonica riffs from Jim Hoke, though.<br />  The standard disc closes with the lovely \\""Stay At Home Mother.\\"" Unlike \\""Waterproof Mascara\\"", there's not a single false note here....your heart just aches by song's end. And Crow's lead vocal?!? WOW!!! Once again, this proves that Sheryl Crow doesn't need to dress things up, that she's at her best when she's just being herself. Stunning.<br />  I don't know why they left \\""This Is You (That Was Then)\\"" and \\""You're Asking The Wrong Person\\"" off the standard disc ~ maybe they thought they were both \\""too Sheryl Crow-ish\\"" ~ but whatever the case, it's a shame....both tracks easily sail into her Top 25 all-time best! \\""This Is You...\\"" has a slinky, sexy, soulful groove to it, with Crow almost purring the lyrics, while \\""You're Asking...\\"" is cute, clever and catchy. (I particularly love the lines \\""But you've got a girlfriend/Who doesn't like you having girls for friends/So you don't always tell her where you've been/Even though you've just been with me again\\""). Die-hard fans should DEFINITELY try to track down the deluxe version of the disc!<br />  So where does Sheryl Crow go from here? Hopefully, her new label will realize she's a POP star, in the best sense of the word, and in all it's co-mingling, genre-bending, cross-over glory. FEELS LIKE HOME's best moments prove this, beyond a shadow of a doubt.

217,5,"This is one CD that is a bargain at any price. I float away in memories of the 70s each & every time I listen to this recording. Once again,always choose Auto Rip & get it loaded to your cloud for no extra charge."
218,5,"Start with &#34;Live Through This,&#34; then continue to &#34;Celebrity Skin.&#34; If you haven't heard Hole before, you're really missing out!"
219,5,There is great music on this CD.  You won't be able to stop yourself from tapping your toes and putting a smile on your face.
220,5,"I was thrilled to discover that one of my all-time favorite bands was back -- not only with a new album (\\""Back Thar N' Over Yonder\\"") but with a new tour as well.<br /><br />I am old enough to remember watching Black Oak Arkansas tear up the stage at the legendary California Jam concern in '74. I wasn't there in person (I'm not quite that old, and California was on the other side of the continent from me back then). But I watched the TV broadcast.<br /><br />There's something endearing about Jim Dandy's gravely voice. It fits with the rough-edged, raw sound of the music.<br /><br />This release is a kind of two-pher. It's newly recorded music combined with lost gems from the '70s.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the music from 2013 is every bit as good as that from 1974. Jim's voice is still darn good. And, if anything, the level of musicianship is even better.<br /><br />Any release from BoA is worth owning. This one is no exception.<br /><br />I've been a fan for nearly 40 years. So I know of what I speak. This is butt-kicking, played-with-passion Southern Rock 'n' Roll (or Raunch 'n' Roll, to be more in keeping with BoA), the likes of which we'll never see again, and certainly don't see enough of now.<br /><br />Buy this. Dig it. And go see BoA on tour.<br /><br />They're the real deal."
221,5,"While I've never been the biggest Beatles fan, this is my favorite album from this group.  And it is one of the rare albums that actually has many great songs on it, not just 1 or 2."
222,5,This was an old CD which I had for years and a friend liked it.  I was happy to be able to obtain it for her.
223,5,Great clean CD to give a woman a taste of me. Now you will know I love music that rules!
224,5,"'nuff said, seriously.  These guys don't release anything that isn't some of the best Christian music you can get.  Add it to your collection if you haven't already."
225,5,"Highly recommend! Heard Pata Negra recently during my travels in Spain and searched for the album on my return. Amazing guitar and fun to listen. Vintage, &#34;en mi opinión.&#34;"
226,5,I loved this album and would encourage any customer and long time fan to buy this product. You will not be disappointed once the album starts you will be able to play it straight through without jumping from track to track. It was worth every penny I currently have four of their albums and will order more as time progresses.
227,5,really fast service. we love this artist and enjoy all of you music. This is really good music and would recommend
228,5,"This came out when I was still a teenager, and I still enjoy the music. My children grew up with it and still enjoy it. I am waiting to see if my grandchildren love BOC."
229,5,"This musical contains some of the best pieces ......... ever.  It is really unfortunate that Dean Jones was not able to stay with the production.  He is excellent, but life has a habit of altering our plans.  As good as Elaine Strich is, she naturally over does it - I like Carol Burnett better, but for the very best, there is a woman in a London production, whose name escapes me, and who is sadly dead now, who REALLY owns the song."
230,5,"I found them looking at Craigs Brother on Wikipedia and i fell in love with the whole album! Especially &#34;Carry love&#34;, that song is badass!"
231,5,"I love this album - the second volume in a \\""series\\""? - of \\""Music from\\"" the HBO series (now starting its fourth season). But you need to know up front that this is not a \\""soundtrack\\"" of the original recvordings played during the show.  These songs,appeared on the soundtrack of the show but in their original form, from 78s and cylinder record by the original artists like Billy Murray and Sophie Tucker. They were also recreated by the modern artists and those are the ones on this CD. The same thing occurred with volume 1.<br /><br />Here we are presented with 20 marvelous tracks by mostly well-known artists like Liza Minnelli, Elvis Costello, Leon Redbone, both Rufus Wainwright (and his dad Loudon III, on separate songs) and Patti Smith. Stephen DeRosa takes most of the Eddie Cantor and Al Jolson songs. And all are backed by the amazing Vince Giordano and the Nighthawks (the last surviving big band in New York). Giordano and his band get two instrumentals as well.<br /><br />One of my favs (among many) is Americana/Folk/Retro singer Pokey LaFarge singing Emmett Miller's hit \\""Lovesick Blues\\"" (a song revived in the 1950s by Hank Williams).<br /><br />Even if you've never seen the show but are a big fan of the 1920s personalities, you'll love this set. The sound is great. The only wish I would have - and other reviewers have commented on as well, is that there could have been some background on the songs (there is none) and at least an acknowledgement to the pioneer recording artists who made each of these tunes a hit.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\""Anything Phonographic\\"""
232,5,it is good to hear real music crafted with hands and minds with skill to write just plain good songs
233,5,"sounds just like I remember it  on vinyl as it should. rock&roll baby! what more can i say, they tell me i need 7 more words."
234,5,"JoAnn's husband here (the orderer) Excellent (swing) music, excellent cover art!<br />Just heard of kay Starr a few weeks ago (Pandora) . Can't wait to listen to more of her music."
235,5,"Jay Black has a wonderful voice ,and this album showcases it nicely. A wonderful trip back to the 60's. Give it a try."
236,5,"I had this album long ago, it's now out of print (I assume since I can not find it new) I have been searching for it for sometime and now I'm glad to have found it.<br /><br />no issues with seller, CD was in the promised condition.  Delivery was prompt."
237,5,"I thoroughly enjoy this album from beginning to end.<br />If you are a Blue October fan this is a must-have. The lyrics are amazing, these guys truly are poets. A lot of the tracks on the album are more upbeat than on past albums, so I feel the band really got to open up and show their talent on the instruments. All in all, Blue October never seems to let me down - and this album just goes to show they not only still got it, but are on top of their game.<br />I highly recommend purchasing this album."
238,5,This new CD is totally awesome. Got it in yesterday & have had it playing ever since! You can't go wrong with this choice. Wonderful to work to...  and sharpens the brain if you follow the notes in your mind! A good neuroscience suggestion. Thile was a mandolin prodigy as a child and he  just gets better and better!
239,5,I play it and other rock lullabyes for my baby every night and it puts her right to sleep. I enjoy it also
240,5,This album is excellent one of the more musical starship albums with the Slick / Balien line up....defiantly an under appreciated gem.
241,5,hello  thanks  because  i find my  old  lp music in cd  i really  like this music and  it comes with very good sound
242,5,If your into big band swing then this is a good band. You will like to listen to this. Hope that you buy and enjoy.
243,5,I am extremely happy with this music and play it often in my car and at work- highly recommend this.
244,5,Had this album back when I was 18 or so and just recently bought this CD of it.  One of my all time favorite live performances captured on disc.  I consider myself to be rather critical when it comes to recording quality and compressed CD mastering drives me up the wall.  I found this disc to have excellent sound overall.  I did not remember quite as much reverb on Burn Down the Mission as this CD delivers but I do rather like the tonal balance of this CD and was glad I chose to go with this version.  Yes the fans may be muted more than the original vinyl but you still get enough fan noise to put you in the spirit of the performance.
245,5,"Because Of You by James Darren was released in 2001. it  is so smooth. All of the CD is fine but particular favorites are, Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You, More Today Than Yesterday, Because Of You, Our Day Will Come, and Dream A Little Dream Of Me. James Darren is a fine singer. Fans of James Darren will like this the most."
246,5,I reviewed this symphony with Previn and it went under the MP3 version.  Please go to that version to see mine and 7 other reviews.
247,5,"i got my album when it said it would come, its only like maybe the first or 2nd time ever"
248,5,"this pianist gives a different, more personal touch to Bach: and it works, it's perfection! really awesome,<br />Go for it! Your ears and brain will thank Piotr!"
249,5,Loved it.  I liked having much of the best music from the series all on one CD.  It was better than I expected.
250,5,"This came quickly, it's the music score from the new movie as stated, be aware this is NOT period music but based on the 2013 movie with hip hop music."
251,5,I can highly recommend this to anyone who loves a great drum and the emotion that it inspires.  A mini Pow-Wow in less than 40 minutes.
252,5,"Recess Monkey has done it again!  Our kids love the new album, Deep Sea Diver.  Their favorite songs are \\""Tambourine Submarine,\\"" \\""Walkie Talkies,\\"" \\""Shrimp\\"" and \\""Fish Sticks,\\"" but all of the songs are super fun.  Its a great album to blast in the car, to let the kids listen to on an ipod while traveling, or to play during a kitchen dance party! (...or any dance party for that matter, we just like ours in the kitchen!) All of the songs are creative, catchy and big fun."
253,5,"I have long been a fan of the Gall Force anime: It is still one of my TOP FIVE favorites even after 20 years!<br />This CD has all of the vocals from the anime. My favorite is \\""Round at the Night\\"". If you loved the songs from the anime, then you should have this CD."
254,4,"The album is a departure from their previous records. This album features the origininal artists along with the guys. In a sense I already have the originals, I really wanted to hear the SNC rendition with their mix of vocal artistry and acrobatics. I started liking it more the second time I listened and again more the third.<br /><br />It's a nice departure, but I hope the next one is a solo album in a sense."
255,5,"I love this album!!!  Growing up my father would find artist like this and listen to them until the whole family couldn't live without them.  This is a long time waiting but has that value.  This album has elements of a wonderful musical childhood<br /><br />Midnight Express (The Chase): by Giorgio Moroder<br />Songs from a distant world, Tubular Bells II: by Mike Oldfield<br />On Air, Eye in the Sky, I Robot, The Time Machine: by Alan Parsons<br />Crockett's Theme: by Jan Hammer<br />Blade Runner: by Vangelis<br />Oxygen: by Jean Michel Jarre<br />Too Hot: by Kool & The Gang<br />C'est Chic, Chic: by Chic/Nile Rodgers<br />Fly Robin Fly: by Silver Convention"
256,3,I didn't even know this album was on cd.  Until I found it on ebay.  The Bellamy Brothers are another one of those artists that I feel need to have all of their back log of albums released on cd.  I dont agree that this is their best album.  I think that would be Rebels Without A Clue.  But this is a pretty good cd.  I bought the song Let Your Love Flow on a '45.  I was 16 when it came out.  And everybody loved that song.  When the record came out and I saw the album cover.  They didn't sound anything like they looked.  Long haired hippie rock stars.  And I didn't get this album until 1981.  Although by then I did have a few other of their records.  Besides Let Your Love Flow.  There weren't any hits on here.  But there are good songs anyway.  With my favorite being Nothing Heavy.  There's a song called Satin Sheets that is not the Jeannie Pruitt song.  Waylon did it on his Ol' Waylon album.  Theres a song called Let Fantasy Live that sounds like it should be back up music for The Cat In The Hat cartoon.  (And I dont mean that in a bad way).  And theres a song called Livin' In The West that shows they can do cowboy stuff.  Overall a good cd.
257,5,I owned a copy of this album before.<br />But I bought the remastered because the sound of my previous CD is not good.<br />The sound of this remastered CD is very good.<br />I like the song &#34;Original Sin&#34; and &#34; I send A Message&#34;.
258,3,"this is a good album, and has a number of very good songs, but also a few not so strong. Coming from \\""codes and keys\\"" this album sounded a bit weak (compared to the very, very good \\""codes and keys\\"" album). I'm still glad I bought it, though."
259,5,"A must have CD. I wish I could be on the beach tanning and chilln by the ocean, well that is what it makes me yearn for....."
260,5,"Dan Kennedy's \\""Intuition\\"" is a delightful instrumental set.  My very favorite track is the opener \\""Easy Living\\"" with its bouncy melody and Jill Haley's English horn.  It keeps me hitting the repeat button.  \\""Redline\\"" is another gem with Premik Russell Tubbs' alto sax churning out a midtempo jazz jewel.  Kennedy's piano on \\""Moving On\\"" sounds like a lament, a looking back or an elegy, with a lovely piano melody.  \\""Jumprope\\"" romps lightheartedly.  This set stands out at first listen and holds interest with repeated play.  A winner! Enjoy!"
261,5,Kids still love it!  I knew all the songs from when I was a kid.  My 3 and 5 year old sing along to each song!
262,5,I prefer to older traditional gospel and this is reall it. I like pretty much every song on this recording
263,2,Three is only one selection that is worth listening to. Paid to much for only 10 songs. Definitely not a good buy.
264,5,"My late dad Joel (R.I.P.) was a good friend of Paul Tobey y he gave mi a copy this CD a while back, just got thru listening to it, now it's a main stay in my CD changer... Bravo Tobey!"
265,5,"For all those wishing for an ultimate version (one of them)of Ravel's piano works, look no further: Monique Haas delivers a beautiful utterly faithful rendition. It really knocked me out! Ravel's heart, humanity, magic & mystery are captured & realized here.I think Monique identified so completely with Maurice's work, that she became him in this performance. Listen to this at night and maybe you'll think Ravel's spirit got channeled through Monique's playing. Want a personal recital within the confines of your home, put this in your player. Just wish there were 6 disks of Haas doing Ravel. Two disks however are wonderful! Can't fathom why Monique Haas never seems to be mentioned in the comparative discussions of best pianists! I think she's extraordinary: the complete package in my estimation seemingly lacking nothing. My hunch about this purchase proved to be right on target. Next I'm going to buy her complete recordings for DG. After listening to Haas play Ravel, you may conclude that both artists are still with us. Debussy in this same set is also quite brilliant and a terrific complement to Ravel.......<br /><br />P.S: This collection is so good I'm tempted to purchase an additional spare! Happy listening......"
266,5,"This is an under rated band, They deserve a shot at the big time, but radio ain't playing them, so check them out with the cd's and you tube,"
267,5,I chose this item because I love Josh's voice and all his CDs are excellent.  I would recommend it to everyone who is a Josh Groban fan.
268,5,"Great performance. CD was well produced. I enjoy Emanuel Ax's interpretation of Brahm's music, in general. I would recommend this CD to friends and family."
269,5,"The fact that this is marketed as a Janine Jansen album might seem both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand we have here a performance featuring one of the world's finest violinists, whilst on the other we're conscious that this is a collection of top-flight soloists in the main, rather than a full-time dedicated chamber unit. You might regard the album cover and speculate as to whether the works will cohere convincingly as ensemble pieces.<br /><br />Verkl&auml;rte Nacht was written on the tail-end of the nineteenth century, and was Arnold Schoenberg's first important work. From the beginning it caused controversy. Inspired by Wagner's ventures into the territories of harmonic dissolution, it was rejected by the Vienna Music Society for containing a 'non-existent' chord; an inverted ninth, which up until then was uncategorised (and therefore couldn't exist). In contrast to Schoenberg's later output it's lyrical and tonally stable, though exquisitely chromatic.<br /><br />The colours which the string players find here graphically reflect the moonlit walk of the lovers in the poem; one can almost visualise the silvery lightness of the moon above, while at their feet all is shadowy darkness. Beneath the surface, a febrile energy intensifies the mood in this programmatic music, which speaks of a couple's acceptance of a pregnancy conceived outside of their relationship.<br /><br />Schubert's great String Quintet was finished only two months before the composer's death in 1828, but had to wait until 1853 to find a publisher. Though today it's recognised as one of the great chamber ensemble works, this didn't seem to be the case at Schubert's death, when he was regarded more highly for his songs. The instrumentation was unusual for having doubled cellos, rather than two violas as had more normally been the case in a quintet set-up.<br /><br />In this recording the interplay appears to be almost telepathic, the dynamic shading changing with a quicksilver rapidity. Every note seems charged with a sparking electrical current, and at first hearing the resulting volatility can be quite disconcerting; it's often edge-of-the-seat stuff. The suspense which the players generate in the Adagio is spine-tingling, so finely nuanced is the phrasing in the build to the climaxes. Perhaps surprisingly, it's the viola which really comes to the fore here, evolving and advancing a layer which is all too rarely heard.<br /><br />The synthesis which Jansen and her friends achieve in these performances gradually melt away any possible resistance which one might have had to this as being simply a marketing ploy on the part of the record company, rather than a recording of intrinsic musical value. As it happens, Jansen is very much a committed chamber player, and this disc marks the tenth anniversary of her International Chamber Music Festival in Utrecht.<br /><br />This is an album which rewards repeated listening, but that really shouldn't present a problem. In fact, I defy you not to put the CD right back to the beginning after you've heard it for the first time.ote seems charged with a sparking electrical current, and at first hearing the resulting volatility can be quite disconcerting; it's often edge-of-the-seat stuff.

270,5,All the songs on this CD were the best of the Grammys for the last year. Great to see such a mix of musical genres on one CD. I listen to this CD regularly.
271,5,"Michael Kiwanuka has such a distinctive voice. I love it and I love this album. Mellow tones, beautiful melodies and that fantastic voice. Great lyric writing too. Music that touches the soul."
272,5,This is also a great look back into the origins of the songs and the mystique of Farmerology. Brave woman.
273,5,great
274,5,"A superb album.  Simply irresistible, with melodies full of pleasure and joy emerging from deep abstract sequences.  I keep discovering new hooks in this album.  My favorite album of the last several years."
275,2,It was damaged on the corner and had some weird maybe glue on it i don't have a clue .
276,5,"I can't believe this group doesn't have more reviews/ratings. 2 Brothers is one of the best Eurodance/house groups from the 90s, combining high-energy lyrics, great beats and the occasional piano mixed in. I can honestly say there isn't a song by them I don't like. I encourage you to poke around for their video for \\""Dreams\\"" and check them out, especially if you like 2 Unlimited, Cappella, La Bouche and other popular 90s dance ensembles. By the way, \\""Can't Help Myself\\"" is originally performed by the disco group Dynasty, though 2 Brothers does the song justice!"
277,4,An excellent CD demonstrating the depth of Harry Nilsson's genius and thankfully produced before the gradual demise of such a wonderful talent.
278,5,"If you remember it, and don't already have it, the Imperial March is a great addition to any music collection."
279,5,"Beautifully done and full of wonderful sound current!  A relaxing and meditative journey for your soul.  Thank you, Russill Paul"
280,5,Loved it!  Been a Tribe Called Quest & Q-Tip fan from the beginning!  Good to hear him continue to move forward in his style!
281,5,"I owned the Haydn first on a wretched US Decca pressing, D9959, then a Heliodor lp.  It was issued in proximity to two other classics: the Andor Foldes/BPO Mozart concerti 17 and 21 and the Eugen Jochum Mozart symphonies 39 and 40 (DL 9973 and 9977- The Foldes has still not been issued on CD).  The Rosbaud Haydn are perfect, especially with the added first movement exposition repeats.  He conducted with great clarity, orchestral balance, tempi and feeling.<br />Poetic feeling is most evident in the slow movements of both symphonies, the trio of 104/3 and the introduction to 104/1.  However, Rosbaud never breaks line/momentum to dramatize deep feelings.And the quick music sparkles without rush, e.g. 92/1 and and 104/4.<br /><br />Major competition exists, but noone that I have heard, even Eugen Jochum (and this is difficult to say) has outgunned Rosbaud in #104.  Closest was George Szell in his #92 , but not his #104.<br />The Mozart fourth concerto with Wolfgang Scheiderhan is lovely and effervescent, especially in the Finale.(It remains my favorite Mozart Violin concerto).<br /><br />Peers: #92-Szell/Sony, Leitner/Cologne/Capriccio, Davis/RCOA/Philips<br />  #104-Jochum/LPO/DG, Davis/RCOA/ Philips; Klemperer/PO/EMI; Tate/ECO/EMI<br />  Mozart #4- Grumiaux/Davis/Philips; Szeryng/Gibson/Philips; Oistrakh/BPO/EMI and Ormandy/Sony"
282,5,What's there to say. I grew up with her music being a child of the 60's in Brooklyn. I put many a coin in a jukebox to play any of her songs. Great CD for Mary Well's lovers.
283,5,This is one of the greatest albums ever. I have it on iTunes but it sounds even better on cassette
284,4,"Nice traditional blues, Slower songs ok. However he could pick up guitar work a little bit on some of the faster songs"
285,5,"Love the old standards he sings.  Only Kenny can do what Kenny can do.  There is another guy I miss like crazy.  Rest well, Kenny, rest well."
286,5,"J. Geils Band is, in my opinion, one of the best bads from the 80s!  The music is great and really fun to listen to.  I highly recommend if you're a fan of theirs!"
287,5,i also think that this is also a great cd to listen to.it also a couple of my favorite singers on it. like KELLY CLARKSON and PINK.anyone who collects the now series and does not have it should buy it because it is worth it.
288,5,My husband loves this band and this genre of music and he absolutely loved this cd for his b - day.
289,5,"I was so into the single ROUTE 101 when it came out in 1982 and followed through to FANDANGO, but for some reason, the album did not make it into my collection.  Total shame, since I've been looking for this one for years to hear the entire thing.  I was hoping the Herb Alpert Signature Series would not stop at RISE.  The entire FANDANGO album is superb.  Though listed as a solo Herb Alpert effort, it is definitely a tribute to the days with the Tijuana Brass, and reflects the 20th anniversary of when Herb saw his first bullfight in Mexico, which started things rolling with THE LONELY BULL in 1962.  The signature tunes are ROUTE 101 and FANDANGO, but all tracks are top notch on this album.  The sound is pristine and all Herb fans will enjoy this update very much.  I'm delighted that this album is finally back in print.  An absolute must."
290,4,I LOVE This CD It Inspires Me From 1965 & 66 The Malt Shop Bubblegum Roots Inspire Me Sooo Much Such As 'Tell Him' & 'Baby Love' Are My Favorites. This CD Has ALL The Hits Of 1965 & 66 Girl Groups If You Want The Track Listings Please Comment
291,5,What an amazing album by a talented singer-songwriter with a bright future.  The songs are smart without being clever:  artistically interesting and complex.  The arrangements work really well too--definitely an album to listen to over and over.
292,5,What a great singer that I remembered from the past. I am glad that I bought this because it brings  back good memories.
293,5,"Mudvayne made somewhat of a splash in the already crowded nu-metal scene way back in 2000 with their debut album, L.D.50, and its brief but aggressively catchy single \\""Dig\\"". Many cite that album as Mudvayne's masterpiece. I personally found its unconventional, prog-inflected approach to nu-metal to be very interesting.  That said, L.D.50 suffered a bit from a lack of hooks and melody and perhaps a touch of over-reliance on screamed vocals. There are a number of tracks that I still struggle to recall from memory even after years of listening.<br /><br />In 2002, Mudvayne dropped their sophomore major label release, The End of All Things to Come. This was actually my first exposure to their music (L.D.50 came after for me), via the single \\""Not Falling\\"". I appreciated the latter tracks's unique balance of melody and aggression. While it took me a few years to get around to it, I finally picked up the album in 2007 and was promptly blown away.<br /><br />The unconventional time signatures and chord-voicings are every bit as present as they were on L.D.50, if not more-so. However, they've infused considerably more melody into their sound. Now make no mistake, there is no radio-pandering pop-metal here. Nothing is dumbed-down for mass-consumption. They simply found a way to fuse that missing element (melody) with the aggressive approach they had previously honed.<br /><br />All elements are balanced in such a way as to make for a truly dynamic metal album, something which the genre often struggles to achieve. Tracks such as \\""World So Cold\\"" and the aforementioned \\""Not Falling\\"" are the most melodic, with the former bordering on ballad territory, while tracks such as \\""Silenced\\"" and \\""Solve et Coagula\\"" go for the jugular right from the get-go. The rest of the tracks generally fall somewhere between these four on the aggressiveness scale.<br /><br />Greg Tribbett's guitar work may not make anyone forget John Petrucci from a technical standpoint, but his chunky, percussive riffage and unique accents command attention throughout. The chorus riffs of \\""Mercy, Severity\\"" and \\""The Patient Mental\\"" never fail to floor me with their combination of heaviness, melody, and originality. These are not isolated moments either; the album is chock full of huge and inventive riffs.<br /><br />Ryan Martinie's bass playing is not quite as prominent as it was on L.D.50 but is still very much a huge part of the sound. He and drummer Matt McDonough lock together to form as potent a rhythm section as you will find in metal.<br /><br />Chad Gray trademark screams are all over the album, though they are used in much more precise fashion and are balanced out well with melodic growls and clean crooning. Most importantly, the vocal melodies and cadence are much improved, which helps make each track stand out from one another.<br /><br />The production also deserves kudos. The instruments are well balanced and clear in spite of the gobs of distortion in Chad's voice and on Greg's guitars. The vocals in particular roar in near-epic fashion throughout without sounding like some brute is screaming in your ear, which is often how that style tends to come across on record.<br /><br />TEOATTC was not the sellout dive into radio-rock that some have accused it of being. That said, it did foreshadow a shift in that direction which was realized on their next album, 2005's Lost & Found. In spite of their move toward radio accessibility, I very much enjoyed Lost & Found as well as the two albums that followed it, The New Game & Mudvayne. That said, they have yet to create another album that fully captures the magic of The End of All Things to Come."
294,5,"I will forever listen to this album. This album is just raw talent. I love him and his music!! My favorite song off this album is Yellow Raincoat because its just so sad, it reminds is that he's not perfect he's human and he's not always happy like we think."
295,5,"El Afinque hits a home run with this killer album tracks such as el Callejero,Me vas a echar de Menos,A maina, La  flauta y el violin,ale you wanna dance"
296,5,"This album has at least three or four cuts which could/should be hits (If It Wasn't for You is obvious, but songs such as Magnetic Field and Dry Your Tears are also stand-outs), and the whole album is solid & consistent. Good hooks, nice playing style, power pop at its best. I'm amazed these guys haven't hit it big."
297,5,"Amazingly talented young lady, whose music will be enjoyed by people of all ages I imagine!  Would like to hear more of her voice but absolutely no complaints about this album."
298,3,"I love Sons, but the music on this cd is just mediocre. At best. I wouldn't order it again and that makes me sad because I was really looking forward to listening over and over. I gave it to my son."
299,5,love maroon 5. upbeat and makes me want to dance. Adam Levine has great vocal abilities-nice to the ear and cute also.
300,5,Renee and Jeremy have done it again! They took some great songs and re-did them and they're easy to listen to. Buy this album - you won't be disappointed.
301,5,"Willie can virtually do no wrong,this album is just a great solid piece of music.Even just casual Willie Nelson fans should have this CD."
302,5,I chose 5 cause this is one of my friend's favorite bands and she absolutely loves them. Can't go wrong with that.
303,3,"When I buy a &#34;Best Of&#34; album, I expect it to contain the best songs from a given performer. This album is a collection of some of Emmylou's best songs and a mish-mash of other songs which aren't fit for a normal album, let alone a &#34;Best Of&#34; album.<br /><br />It appears to be an attempt by a record company to increase their revenue by taking advantage of an established artist."
304,5,Gave this as a gift. They were very pleased to receive it so that is about all I can say about this.
305,5,"I am not sure what made me reach back to my youth and purchase this recording on CD. I think I heard a &#34;Steelers Wheel&#34; tune and it got me thinking about Rafferty. No matter, I can now say that I appreciate this recording even more than I did when it was first released.  Of course, &#34;Bakers Street&#34; never gets old. Who knows how many times I have listened to that tune over the years. BUT, there are so many good songs on this CD. All of them really. I now have enough musical experience from a few years to appreciate the incredible song writing. One thing that I just realized however, was just what a great vocalist Gerry Rafferty was. Somewhere between optimistic and haunghting. Quite an interesting quality and range to his lyrical phrasing. Do yourself a favor and pick this one up again. It is an open, honest and inspiring CD. Flows well and gives plently to think about. Not deep thinking, just nice life bits. So, with that, I will ride these tunes for many years to come. Glad I bought it!"
306,5,"As God is my witness, I thought I was going to pass out when I saw this album finally re-released. I guess I, and friends, have sent about 30 letters to Vanguard over the years for Vol. 2 to be re-issued and here it is. Hedy West was in a class by herself. To sit in a small club and listen to her was heaven on earth, and when you hear \\""Brown Girl\\"" or \\""Cotton Mill Girls\\"" you'll never attempt them again if you're an old time picker as I am. We lost Hedy way too early but we finally have most of her music back on cd's. I guess Ace re-released and I thank  you folks, you at least know good folk and appalachian music when you hear it. Can't wait until my CD arrives. As for Hedy, keep teaching that Heavinly Choir how to frail on the long neck banjo. RIP sweetheart, we all miss you so much!!!"
307,4,"Always been a little bit of a fan, but never purchased her CD's until this album.  Good vocals and music...Keep it up!"
308,1,"I hope Mr. Tates' wine business is doing fairly well, because his music career is dead. Very sad, because few bands can put out the quality of THE WARNING, RAGE FOR ORDER, OPERATION MINDCRIME and EMPIRE in their entire career, much less back to back. It all started going downhill VERY quickly upon Chris DeGarmo's departure.I'm aware this is not a Queensryche release, and I enjoy quite a few songs on his last solo effort, but it seems he has completely lost touch with, or turned his back on whatever remaining fans he may have had, including myself...and he won't gain any new ones with this release. It is simply a painful listen."
309,3,bought as a gift for a old friend and the fablous fabian was not much of a singer so how could you expect the cd to make him better however if you like the late 50s music its fine
310,5,"If you are and Jeff Lynne fan you will love this album. Jeff plays all of the instruments, all vocals, and mixes what you hear. Amazing and enjoyable."
311,5,My son is a great fan of Tina's and as we had a tornado here in 2011 we are trying to replace the ones he lost
312,5,Great music and wonderful DVD all in one. Not only can you listen to the music but you can see it performed.
313,5,Somewhat different from his previous effort Julian Plenti. Quite enjoyable if you are into something a little different by Interpol standards.
314,3,"i was a little disappointed with this cd of whitney houston, it sounded to me that this was'nt  remastered at all"
315,5,"great singer, she has a great voice, great album..this is the second  album i 've bought about her..<br />let the music play  is the one of the best records of breakdance"
316,5,My favorite Christmas song is Holly Jolly Christmas and Burl Ives is &#34;Mr. Christmas&#34;. This Cd is a must have for any Christmas music collection.
317,5,"Found this group on the internet, liked what I heard so I got the album.  Interesting music.  Will be looking for more from this group."
318,5,I purchased this for myself he is the only thing I asked Santa for to bad I didn't get him !!  Price was awesome .....
319,4,The Guess Who ase consistant with their music there is overlapping of albums I like albums that have a complete list of songs that are unique to that album.
320,1,"First of all, I want to make it clear that I was supposed to be at the station fire in RI, where Great White played in 2003 and 100 people died. Many of them were my friends.  Jack Russell, who in my opinion is a punk stated that he would never play Desert Moon live again out of respect for all the lives lost.  Apparently, all he cares about is money because as you can see the song is the first song, as it was in Feb of 2003 when 100 people lost their lives selflessly. Jack Russell was never charged, and really took no responsibility for what happened, even though it was his tour and he was the boss. The least he could have done was kept his word about not playing that song again ever. I was a fan of Great White in the 80s and didn't go that night because I had a headache. Many of my friends did go. Some lived, some died, and some were injured. Jack Russell could have at the very least kept his word about not playing that song again."
321,2,"I can't tell if they are appealing to the mainstream now, or if they're just getting soft on us.  This album is just, eww.  I kept skipping tracks and never liked any of them.  \\""Are You Dead Yet?\\"" Was the last good album they ever made.  They have really lost their touch."
322,5,"I really love this Group's offering. My favorite songs are; The Agenda, My Dear, and It's About Time. Ruby Velle sounds a lot like Amy Winehouse. The band is tight and sound is full. I think it sounds best on a good sound system. Headphones are OK but I like to feel the music and you can only do that with a good sound system."
323,4,"Some folks would have you believe that Rick Danko was a complex man, truth be told, it was really youth disguised as complexity that laid out the path Rick he would follow for his far too short life.  Hailing from Canada, by way of his United States southern roots, he grew up in a musical family, cutting his teeth on the pleasantries of family music, and was sustained by the likes of Hank Williams, Fats Domino, Sam Cooke, and any other artist who presented themselves with musical interpretations that were soulful, deeply felt, and personal ... yet contained an element of being delivered off the cuff, and nearly matter of factly.  The man was a multi-instrumentalist, wore his heart on his sleeve, and was recognized as a talent to be reckoned with by such artists as Neil Young, Eric Clapton, Jorma Kaukonen, Paul Butterfield, Doug Sahm, Ronnie Wood, Bob Dylan, George Harrison, and of course Ronnie Hawkins', who's band Rick joined at just seventeen years of age.<br /><br />This album is brilliantly good.  Of course there are bodies of work out there that will lay you flat and take your breath away, but I don't always need to be laid out flat, or left breathless.  Sometimes I just want to feel that I'm in comfortable arms, floating to the skin chilling \\""New Mexico,\\"" \\""Shake It,\\"" or the classic \\""Small Town Talk,\\"" where he pays homage to his early AM radio heros.  It's impossible to listen to this release, an album that was overshadowed by the release of The Band's Last Waltz, causing it to slip almost unnoticed by the public at large, with others feeling that he was merely riding on the coattails, and taking advantage of The Last Waltz, when the reality of the situation is that it's impossible to listen to this outing without feeling that you've come face to face with the heart and soul of The Band.  And with all of this, he could still snap back anyone's head with a surprising song like \\""Brainwash\\"" or \\""Java Blues.\\""<br /><br />Rick's music will always float on the breezes, and perhaps if your window's open when the moon's rising slow, those dancing curtains may just carry a song into your heart.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Keslerand perhaps if your window's open when the moon's rising slow, those dancing curtains may just carry a song into your heart.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Kesler"

325,5,"This disc, recorded in 1983, provided arguably definitive versions of all three pieces. Larrocha may not have made a finer disc and as such, this has dominated the catalogue in terms of this repertoire since it was first issued.<br /><br />The main work known to most collectors is, of course, the Falla Nights in the Gardens of Spain. This is a curious work being more substantial in both length and content than many non-concerto compositions while not being as substantial in the normal concerto manner. Neither is it such a show-piece, being more reflective and descriptive in its nature. It is therefore a difficult piece to program in a concert or on record. Rubinstein was well-known for this piece but his recordings really sound too elderly nowadays particularly when compared with this fine and more modern account. It has successfully triumphed over all other recordings since 1983.<br /><br />Much the same can be said about the two pieces by Albeniz and Turina. Both of these are more outwardly effective and make excellent companions to the Falla and together they make this disc a most attractive and unique combination.<br /><br />Therefore for those who are attracted to this program the choice seems obvious. Buy it! The recording is as excellent as are the contents and performances."
326,5,"Great CD, recieve the cd in just a few days and it was everything I was expecting from Kirk Franklin music."
327,4,"Over a year ago, Chris Mann was featured on one of the other campaigns I participated in (I forget which website it was?) as a new upcoming artist.  A few months later, he actually became the fourth place finalist from the second season of \\""The Voice\\"". He was able to work with Christina Aguilera as his mentor. I was in awe of not only of his talents (he is an awesome singer!) but also of his good looks.  He is a hottie!<br /><br />I was really excited about getting picked to review his new album \\""ROADS\\"" (released Oct. 30, 2012) for One2OneNetwork!  His voice reminds me of a crossover between Josh Groban, Michael Buble and Elliott Yamin.  He just has a really sensual side to him with a little R&B and opera mixed in with his contemporary style of music.  He can reach really high notes (think in the styles of Christina Aguilera & Celine Dion) which is impressive.  He sings with such romanticism and passion, makes you melt like butter.  This album would be perfect to play during a dinner party or a romantic night with your lover...or while you're relaxing in the hot tub with some candles lit up.<br /><br />The first song Roads in the album is probably my favorite. The words have so much meaning for me personally.  His renditions of songs like \\""I Need You Now\\"" (by Lady Antebellum), \\""On A Night Like This\\"" (by Dave Barnes) and \\""Ave Maria\\"" (a classic!) were very well done.  Not to say the other songs weren't well done at all, but those were some of my other favorites.  He sang Coldplay's song \\""Viva La Vida\\"" and I just didn't think it suited him.  Although I like the song itself, I just didn't think it was his kind of style.  But good for him for trying.  Overall, I think he has a heavenly voice and is great eye candy.  His album wasn't mind-blowing by any means but I thought it was a good debut.  ;)<br /><br />I encourage you to purchase his album and check out for yourself how great he really is as an artist.

328,5,"Here is music composed by a 20th century English composer that has a distinctive new sound but is still essentially lyrical and tonal. There is no sign of the `pastoral' string and woodwind sound that is often associated with 20th century English composers, like Vaughan Williams, Butterworth and Finzi. Foulds was born in Manchester in 1880, the son of a bassoonist in the Hall&eacute; orchestra.<br /><br />This CD opens with the mystical Three Mantras for orchestra that are now all that are left of a Sanskrit opera, Avatara, that Foulds worked on in the 1920s. These are followed by another spiritual-sounding work - the Lyra Celtica, a vocalise concerto for voice and orchestra: the singer is the mezzo-soprano Susan Bickley, who has a quite lovely timbre to her voice. Next is the Apotheosis or Elegy `dedicated to the memory of Joseph Joachim'. Unsurprisingly therefore it is a relatively short (12 min) concerto for violin and orchestra, with Daniel Hope as soloist. The final work on this CD is Mirage. The Elegy and Mirage are also respectively known as the Fourth and Fifth Music Poems for orchestra. This is a thoroughly engaging selection of music from Warner Classics, played by the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra with the participation of the City of Birmingham Youth Chorus in the second of the Three Mantras.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000EQHV52 John Foulds: Dynamic Triptych; Music-Pictures III]]"
329,5,"Great compilation! Definitely worth the money. Many songs are new to me, but great to hear. The DVD is good, too."
330,5,"Age of Innocence by OLN is one of my favorite new albums. I bought it for myself but my two sons love it too, and we can't stop listening to it. It's a gripping, driving album with equal parts beautiful harmony and hammering hard rock. OLN has become one of my favorite bands and I'm going back to pick up the rest of their albums, starting with We Will All Evolve."
331,5,"Typical of RCA/CAMDEN's mid-'70s Big Band reissues, FRENESI (ACL1-0590-e) has been reprocessed into fake stereo. The effect works well over speakers; headphones are another matter. Source material for these nine tracks is very clean and the music is as pretty as front album cover art-- prettier, even.<br /><br />SIDE ONE NOTES<br />\\""Frenesi\\"" is by the band Shaw assembled after returning from a Mexican sabbatical. It has added strings. \\""Back Bay Shuffle\\"" is by his original \\""Beguine\\"" unit and is a real swinger. The first minute of \\""Indian Love Call\\"" has a prominent tom-tom beat. Tony Pastor's vocal reminds me of Louis Prima. \\""'S Wonderful\\"" was arranged by Ray Conniff. Later with COLUMBIA, Ray made this the title song of one of his [[ASIN:B000K5OLXC LP]]s. It's by Artie's fourth band in just seven years! Only a troubled eccentric as Shaw would have such a theme song as \\""Nightmare. It's a droning, moody piece with Artie's clarinet racing up and down the scales. One of his very best.<br /><br />SIDE TWO NOTES<br />\\""Begin the Beguine\\"" is a \\""live\\"" version made four years after the original hit single. Constant requests for \\""Beguine\\"" wore upon Shaw's patience. Urgent hi-hat and pounding toms push \\""Softly, As in a Morning Sunrise\\"" along.

333,4,"THE RASCALS-THE ULTIMATE RASCALS: Honing their chops at the legendary Peppermint Lounge as members of JOEY DEE's STARLIGHTERS, THE RASCALS expertly fused the best elements of rock, pop and RNB for a healthy run of scintillating chartstoppers during the second half of the sixties. Helmed by FELIX CAVALIERE's churchy organ fills and passion-filled lead vocals, the summery GROOVIN', YOU BETTER RUN's dirty funk vibe, and joyous anthem PEOPLE GOT TO BE FREE were pure blasts of AM radio righteousness. Canny covers of THE OLYMPICS' obscurity GOOD LOVIN' and the ribald WILSON PICKETT staple MUSTANG SALLY were the exception more than the rule, since most of the band's best material was penned by CAVALIERE and EDDIE BRIGATI. THE RASCALS' final chapter found them embracing gospel and psychedelic overtones for less popular, though still admirable efforts including SEE and CARRY ME BACK. ULTIMATE gathers up twenty sonic slabs of passion-saturated blue eyed soul guaranteed to plaster a warm, nostalgic smile on any listener's mug.<br /><br />RATING: FOUR SOULS"
334,1,"What is deep art to some is tacky pretentiousness to others.  While more \\""subtle\\"" than the earlier incarnation of Current 93, the attempt at vague creepiness is still heavy handed - This is not really a new idea, that's what Alice in Wonderland hits on. Tibet's sad, sensitive guy vocals would be laughable if he didn't sound so much in need of medication (\\""The sad sadness song\\"" appears on another record from the era, thankfully \\""When the May Rain Comes\\"" is a little more memorable).  And while Tibet fancies himself a poet, this is lousy poetry.  Read Elizabeth Bishop or Wallace Stevens and if you want dark, creepy music, there's a motherlode of better stuff than this.  C93 was best to avoid its attempts at \\""death folk\\"" and stick to the sledgehammer menace of the early records. M. Gira and The Swans made the transition much more gracefully.  You can spin through their folk phase without wincing in embarrassment for them!<br /><br />Somebody introduce the fans to the weird British folk of the late 60s/early 70s (The Incredible String Band, Dando Shaft), the DOM record, Amon Duul's Para Dieswarts, or SPK's Byzantine Flowers!  If they're hard to find, go to youtube."
335,4,"How can I review a soundtrack that has been around longer than I have?  Maybe it's best to consider the year and the fact that just about everything was done on acetate recording tape. Restoration Producer, Randy Thornton, had his work cut out for him in 1997.  Adding echo, attempting to clean up and digitally remixing a 1941 Soundtrack wasn't the easiest chore in the world. But give the guy credit, he did the best he could. [Information about the soundtrack and words to the songs are included in a colorful book that comes with the CD].<br /><br />\\""DUMBO\\"" has the distinction of being the 4th of the five original Disney Animated Classics.  [The other 4 being: SNOW WHITE, PINOCCHIO, FANTASIA and BAMBI].  It's also the shortest coming in at around 64 minutes. So practically every music bed has been utilized to keep the CD from ending too soon.<br /><br />The songs by Frank Churchill, Ned Washington and Oliver Wallace pretty much speak for themselves. \\""Look Out For Mr. Stork\\"" anticipates the arrival of the newborns.  \\""Casey Jr.\\"" describes the train trip from one town to another. \\""Song of the Roustabouts\\"" who are responsible for setting up the circus tent for 'The Biggest Little Show On Earth!' \\""Baby Mine\\"" is the love song from Mrs. Jumbo to her abandoned off-spring. \\""Pink Elephants On Parade\\"" demonstrates what happens when a little too much \\""bubbly\\"" gets inside your system! And it's impossible not to love \\""When I See An Elephant Fly\\"" sung by the Crazy Scat Crows when they discover Dumbo and Timothy Mouse mysteriously up in a tree!<br /><br />The only thing missing is watching Dumbo's Ears flap up and down! That's the only portion of the CD that requires your imagination. But don't let that stop you!  Enjoy the music."
336,5,It was exactly what I expected and the quailty of the music on the cd is excellent. I am extremely satisfied with the product.
337,5,"absolutly best originals I have heard in years, I compare him to pink floyd and the best of the beatles all in one - I liked no. 1 and no. 10 personally but all of his music is outstanding I recommend him to all real rock and rollers as an example to follow"
338,4,"I have liked Bea Wain sice seeing video of her performing with Larry Clinton's Orch. This is my first Bea CD and apart from a couple of corny songs it is first rate, great voice, great style. Now I want more. Bless you Bea."
339,5,"Love the album, almost every song is good. Some are very deep and thought provoking and some are just good fun. Highly recommended."
340,2,"With this one, and especially the next one, Blackout, the music & lyrics surely took a turn for the worst, definitely taking aim at the 12-14 yr old market, with any seriousness tossed aside--any album they did after Lovedrive, in fact, just doesn't hold a candle to their earlier stuff, especially when they went for the big bucks & the commercialism of \\""Rock you like a herd-of-cans\\"" (more like a herd of sheep)--sorry, they lost me starting with this one going forward. (forward?)"
341,5,"Now this is really a great CD is you are a jazz enthusist like me. Normann Brown is incredible on the guitar. he features a few other noted artist also one of them being Stevie Wonder, Bobby Lyle just to name a few. This probably one of the best jazz CDs i own."
342,4,"Taken on its own, this is a good album; Ella sings well, Duke's orchestra can't fail to please.  But...  Well, quite simply Ella isn't at her best live.  Unlike some jazz musicians who are spurred on to their best by an audience, Ella is at her best in a studio.  If you read the biographies of her, she actually suffered from strong stage-fright throughout her career, and you can hear it.  Simply put she doesn't have the same control over her voice in this album than you can hear in her studio albums.  This is the only album of Ella's where I have heard her hit a bum note.  Add to this her usual nervous tick of saying thank-you many times between songs to quieten the crowd.  Don't get me wrong, this is still an album worth having and worth listening to, but in my view it's surpassed by the performances and recording quality of the studio-recorded \\""Ella at Duke's Place\\"", where many of the same pieces are brilliantly performed at their finest, even definitive form.  Given the choice, I'd say most listeners should buy that album first."
343,4,"Was looking for my cassette forever, and decided to get the CD. Good thinking, always loved her music and can now enjoy it without worry. Her music is alive today as it was then."
344,5,"If you enjoyed watching the Korean Drama Rooftop Prince series that recently finished airing around 5/12 (on Hulu and other Asian drama sites), you will enjoy this.  Some of the songs in this and part one of the OST is still pretty good music and songs by themselves without even watching the drama.  Since these are imported, the cover and songs are written in Korean.  Can't wait until they have the dvd of the drama released."
345,4,"If you like Italian bell-canto music, you will enjoy this opera of Donizetti. His genius seems to be in the variety of melodies he utilizes from one opera to the next. It is not a studio recording and there is no libretto. But, the plot is considerably good for opera stories and is not difficult to follow. However, I would recommend  that listeners be provided with a libretto."
346,5,"Previous to this release, my top 3 Krokus albums were One Vice At A Time, Headhunter, and The Blitz.  Having said this, it should be clear that I prefer the no-nonsense, Hard Hock sound that Krokus became known for during the early to mid-eighties.  As such, I was typically disenchanted when the band strayed from this formula on subsequent efforts.  In fact, it wasn't until their reunion in 2004 that I actually began to get excited about Krokus again.  Even so, although the Rock The Block album has its moments, it fails to deliver the consistent punch I was hoping for.  Well, this problem was fully resolved with Hellraiser.  In short, it is excellent from start to finish.......one of those rare discs that you can simply load, press play, and ROCK OUT!!!  Furthermore, Hellraiser is a legitimate candidate for 'Best Rock Album of 2006', and is one of Krokus's best efforts to date!"

The paperwork mentions the bonus DVD, they asked me to review it, but it is not what I ordered.<br /><br />So please make sure you know what you are going to get from Amazon before you click the \\""buy\\"" button!<br /><br />The 3 stars is because the audio is great, the album a masterpiece, the extra tracks cool.

348,2,"I've been with these guys since Burn My Eyes and even saw them with Slayer in the mid-90's (Divine Intervention tour) and with the exception of Supercharger have eagerly anticipated and enjoyed every Machine Head release, especially Through the Ashes of Empires and the phenomenal The Blackening. But from first listen last fall to today I simply cannot stand this Machine Head release, Unto the Locust. It's a pretentious mess of guitar-god noodling that goes nowhere fast, melo-dramatic, sappy lyrics and, my god, a children's choir on one of the songs. It sounds they were shooting for The Blackening part two, but could not get lightening to strike the same place twice. On a positive note, I'm really, really glad I did NOT shell out big bucks on the deluxe CD version, instead opting for the much cheaper download and even then, for the first time ever, I want a refund. I do want to say something positive about Machine Head because they are a great band and that is all of these songs will probably sound much better live like the Supercharger stuff on Hellalive. I hope so.<br />I downloaded this Machine Head turd and Opeth-Heritage (deluxe) on the same day- guess which one I listen to much more often?<br />I really hope this is not the new Machine Head sound because I'll probably just sit the next one out."
349,5,"Years ago, I read a brief review of this CD in Uncut magazine and would search for it from time to time. Finally was able to order and receive (as opposed to availability vanish a couple times in the past). Though it came out in 2004, it's my favorite CD of 2012. It's an incredible collection of songs. The first time I played it, the book I was looking through was laid aside and forgotten. I love this album!<br />I must give props to Amazon, in that, several times I have searched for something out of print, out of country, etc. and have learned that you just come back and keep popping that name or title in from time to time and a hit will happen at some point.<br />It paid off this time, big time.<br />And in the words of so many of those commercials: \\""I am a non-Amazon-paid-or-influenced customer.\\"""

351,5,"REDBONE-GOLDEN CLASSICS: Retro record label COLLECTABLES has done a bang-up job encapsulating the bloozey roots rock  of Native American band REDBONE, combining two of their best seventies albums MESSAGE FROM A DRUM & POTLATCH, plus assorted singles on one disc. REDBONE's rich, murky sound was slathered in searing soul power, syncopated tribal rhythms, hook-laden guitar licks and vocal harmonies supplied by blood brothers/former session musicians PAT & LOLLY VEGAS. The swamp-stompin' jam MAGGIE, voo-doo chant WITCH QUEEN OF NEW ORLEANS, and scintillating RNB/pop smash COME & GET YOUR LOVE (even SOUL TRAIN played that one) are merely the best known tracks here; steaming funk chunk JUDGEMENT DAY and the percolating raunch of DRINKIN' AND BLO are not to be missed. The definitive double vinyl collection COME & GET YOUR REDBONE finally made it to CD in 2014, but GOLDEN CLASSICS, a virtual greatest hits platter, also goes a long way towards preserving REDBONE's criminally underrated legacy.<br /><br />RATING: FIVE HEADDRESSES"
352,5,"Whoever that labeled this compilation as \\""THE COMPLETE\\"" Collection is dead wrong. Even if one confines to only tracks recorded for the British \\""DECCA\\"" or the American \\""LONDON\\"" label, there are still many tracks that are missing. For example,the tracks \\""Stardust\\"", \\""Around the World\\"", \\""Try To Remember\\"",\\""Misty\\"", etc., which are included in another compilation album called \\""THE VERY BEST OF MANTOVANI\\"" (DECCA 460-040-2), cannot be found in the present collection.<br /><br />Nevertheless, if you love Mantovani's unique Strings, and his quasi-classical orchestral arrangements to some of the beautiful melodies ever written in pop music, this very inexpensive box set is highly recommended. The mere fact that all the tracks from the album \\""MUSIC FROM THE FILMS\\"" (recorded with the pianist duo Rawicz & Landauer) are included is worth the price of this box set."
353,5,So far this is a great product! I have never been very healthy when it comes to eating. I often eat way to much and wait until I am really overweight until I actually diet. When I actually decide to diet I literally eat nothing but one meal a day which is usually just a can of soup or a salad with no dressing. Dieting like this puts your body into starvation mode which considerable slows down your metabolism resulting in low weight loss. This normally destroys the whole point in eating that little in the first place. Thanks to this I can successfully do my crazy diet and keep my metabolism up as if I was eating normally. I have been losing 2 pounds a day so far compared to what usually is about 1! I also have enough energy to keep me from feeling faint or weak. I don't really recommend my diet for anyone but if this stuff helps me it should definitely help someone on a normal diet as well.
354,5,"There are not many quartets who have chosen to record all the Haydn quartets.  The only famous quartet that I know of who has done a number of them is the Lindsays.  The Aeolian Quartet did a complete set in the 1970's and the Kodaly Quartet did them all in the 1990's. In my opinion, the Buchberger Quartet is the most successful traversal of these masterpieces.  They incorporate some of the H.I.P. scholarship without being slaves to it.  For example, they use modern instruments with steel strings, but they play with a minimum of vibrato.  Much of the phrasing is in line with H.I.P. scholarship, but they are not above caressing a phrase when they need to.  They also bring out the full joy and humor that is the essence of Haydn. When you consider that these recordings were recorded from 2004 to 2008, the asking price for this Brilliant Classics set is an absolute steal.  I should point out that the set does not include a booklet, but instead a CD-Rom that give notes on all the quartets. Highly recommended."
355,5,"Needed music for a safari baby shower; and this cd was one of my choices. It was perfect! But more so, the music is very enjoyable regardless of the occasion!"
356,5,"Katharine McPhee's voice is gorgeous, but I feel like she shouldn't be singing pop, but rather jazz, traditional pop, or big band style like Michael Buble, clearly her recording company does not realize that.  This is an excellent album, awesome début like what most reviewers have wrote. Highly recommended."
357,5,"I Love this guy, he is my uncle, he tough me how to sing.... I remember being a young child and hearing him with his guitar in my front-room, he inspires me as a singer myself. If you want someone who can really make you enjoy music go here. buy this album he is amazing."
358,5,"Love the song Wolves.  My favorite song in the Animal Years, not just to listen to and soak it in, but also wonderful exercise music.  I can feel my spirit soaring even though the lyrics are sad.  Saw Josh Ritter perform live at the Wiltern, and knew I had to listen to more, and more often."
359,5,"Thank You ,Thank You ,Thank You,to all who were involved in the making of this CD.I loved Steven's lp Caravan Tonight in the seventies.It spoke to me and for me,as a gay man of Steven's generation.Periodically I look for a CD release of CT or other works by him.At last that wish has come true.After I moved to San Francisco in 1982,I hoped that one day my path and Steven's would cross. Although I never got to know him personally ,I did get to se him perform his songs at Valencia Rose and the Gay Pride parade.To have his later songs finally to enjoy over and over is like a treasured momento from an old friend .God bless all involved ,I know Steve would be proud. After his show at VR ,I asked him when he would record his new songs.He said if he had the back up of the first LP he would.Now atlast the moonlight shines!"

361,5,"I absolutely love Chiodos, and this is one of their best albums! Awesome artwork, great songs... I give it a ten!"
362,5,WOW! This CD is Amazing!  Who would ever think that there is little to no Instruments used in making these songs sound soooo good.
363,4,"Is it their best album? No. Everything from \\""Black Album\\"" back is way better than this.  Is it better than \\""Load\\""?  Hell, yes. Anything's better than that borefest. Is it better than \\""Re-Load\\""?  Debatable. That one had better songs than its predecessor, and the typical beefy-yet-overdone 90's Metallica sound. I still gotta give the edge to \\""St. Anger\\"" over \\""Re-Load\\"" though. In fact, the sound on this one seems to be a reaction to that, hence muting pads on the drums, the barely-there bass, and the complete lack of solos. If you absolutely can't stand it on the first song, it won't get any better for you as the CD plays on.  I didn't mind it so much myself. Perhaps a whole album of it wasn't real necessary, but I understand the band's need to shake things up a bit.    For me, it's a matter of are the songs good...and the answer is an overwhelming yes. Way better than the crap on \\""Load\\"" anyway. \\""St. Anger\\"", \\""Some Kind Of Monster\\"", \\""Shoot Me Again\\"", \\""Frantic\\"", \\""Invisible Kid\\"", and \\""All Within My Hands\\"" have memorable choruses (not necessarily the sign of a great song, but for me at least, the sign of a GOOD song) and the piercing treble-y production kinda accentuates the melodies, actually.    It's not the greatest Metallica album, no.  But it's still quite good."
364,5,Wonderful sound remastering! This brings a new dynamic to the recordings - cannot beat this production in sound and packaging.
365,5,"When you love Quantum Leap, you love this soundtrack! The songs are amazing. And Scott Bakula's voice: terrific! Big Bonus: The Quantum Leap theme too."
366,5,I ordered this set of CDs for my husband and he loves them. Order arrived quickly and in great conditions. Hubby also liked the bonus DVD included. Thanks!!
367,5,"This is a very good album.  The majority of the songs, like a \\""Simple man\\"" and \\""Sweet home Alabama\\"" are beautifully written.  I highly recommend it."
368,5,"This long awaited album is pure Darren Hayes.  I have been a fan for 13 years and I can say that no other pop artist has what he does.  Pure musical genius.  His crystalline voice is what it's all about.  Every song on the album is a favorite.  Obviously, Bloodstained heart is fantastic as is Black out the Sun, God walking into the Room, Stupid Mistake and Taken by the Sea.  The Siren's Call is breathtaking.  It gets to your very soul. This album is worth every penny. The only thing better than this album is watching Darren perform live.  No other artist,in my opinion, has the ability to connect on a personal level with his fans. Seductive and brilliant."
369,5,"Even if you think you've heard all the Grateful Dead you need to hear, you need to listen to this.  Disc two starting off with Dark Star > Drums > The Other One is well worth the price of these discs alone.  It's crazy it has taken this long for the record label to give the fans what they truly deserve, an unmasked look at the Grateful Dead doing what they do best."
370,5,"I am a big fan of the old classic western music.  I especially like \\""Roll Muddy River\\""  It is one of those songs that gets stuck in your head and you find yourself singing it all day."
371,5,"Plumb is a wonderful artist and singer. This awesome 2CD collection is your ticket If you enjoy haunting, beautiful melodies. Songs such as \\""Cut\\"", \\""Hang On\\"" and \\""In My Arms\\"" are classics and the remixes are equally so."
372,1,"This sacd sounds just dreadful. How can MOFI release such crap? I'm really angry that they boast about fantasic soung, etc, when the sound is just muddy, no high, no low end, no nothing.MOFI really has lost the plot. Nor just this release but all the latest releases. They most use the wrong equipment or something. The records they release sounds dull with no snap and no dynamics. I sugest that we as consumeres tell them and protest by sending them e mails telling them this."
373,5,Excellent product. Summary of the best spanish singer carrer. Lyrics and music are as current as in 1980 with the new musical versions.
374,5,"Brilliant, innovative, satirical, clever.  Dengue Fever has long appealed to loyalists of Khmer language music.  In either Khmer or English, Chhom Nimol's vocal prowess is evident, but musically, much of Dengue Fever's earlier material fell outside of the range of western and international audiences.  By adding more English language songs, Dengue Fever (a Los Angeles based band) has expanded the band's reach and accessibility a thousand fold.  Early fans, particularly those who speak Khmer and appreciate the nuances of Cambodian music may be disappointed, but for most of us it is huge bonus.  This is an innovative effort with half a dozen air-time worthy songs.  The first half of the CD is brilliant, the second half very good.  Lyrics are clever and amusing, laced with satirical social commentary.  Throw in some old school funk and you have one of the most entertaining albums of the decade."
375,5,I was very pleased with This Is War by 30 Seconds To Mars. My 10 year old son played their video on Comcast on Demand and I saw it. I really liked it and the music is terrific! I am so glad I bought this CD. Which says something for an old fogy to like this I guess. I am 48 years old and I think 30 Seconds To Mars is great!!!!!
376,5,"Another nostalgic find from Amazon!!!   I had an 8-track from BMG when it first came out, and assumed it was one of those compilations that I'd never see again.  \\""Aging with time...like yesterday's wine\\""   Love it."
377,5,finally a great tribute to one of the greatest  singer songwriter of rock and roll history. album is teriffic. i am proud to say that i was one of buddys first fans way back to 1957. still rockin'.
378,5,"I am more of a Mark Twain fan than bluegrass/country music fan.  In fact, when I saw a sample of this on a recent trip to Hannibal, I didn't know who half the artists were!  I was, however, able to listen to the entire CD from start to finish and read through the liner notes.  All around, this is a quality project. The music reminds me of \\""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou\\"" and the narration tells a splendid story in just the right amount.  The songs selected to accompany the narration were spot on - some old stuff, some new stuff.<br /><br />This Two-CD set tells the life story of Mark Twain, but not just the nuts-and-bolts of his life, but it tells the emotional story of his life.  His love, and his loss.  Mark Twain is a complicated character but this CD set captures the essence of who he was.<br /><br />The liner notes are well done and include pictures of Twain interspersed with notes about the songs and a transcript of the narration. I don't know how the producers did it, but they got Jimmy Buffet, Garrison Keillor and Clint Eastwood to narrate the parts of Huck Finn, generic narrator, and Mark Twain, respectively.<br /><br />If I have one criticism (and it's a minor one) it's of Clint Eastwood as Mark Twain.  Maybe it's just me and too many \\""Dirty Harry\\"" movies.  He did do a decent job, though, and I could really hear Twain speaking through him.  So again, it's just a minor nit-pick about an overall high-quality production.<br /><br />If you like Twain, any of the artists on this CD, or if you liked \\""Oh Brother\\"" then this CD is for you!"
379,5,"Quite simply, this was an album that changed the landscape of not just Rock and Roll, but Blues as well. Not to mention (OK, I am mentioning it), the first Heavy Metal album as well. I don't have the space for a disertation on these two points, but you don't have to agree with me (you'd be wrong, of course!) Those two points aside, there's not too many rock music fans who wouldn't rank this as one of the top 20 or 25 albums of all time. Certainly it is one of the greatest debut albums of all time as well. Jimmy Page's blistering guitar combined with Robert Plant's incredible vocals and backed by one of the greatest bass/drums pairs of all-time in John Paul Jones and John Bonham, this band and this album in particular changed Rock music in a big way. Put it on, CRANK IT UP (just a decible or two below having the neighbor's calling the cops is proper volume, BTW) and ROCK OUT!! Then repeat as many times as needed until you're ready to move on to some live Zeppelin. Refer as needed to this review for proper listening volume instructions.........   What are you still reading this for? Get this album on the stereo, mp3 player, your car, or whatever and start rattling those windows!!"
380,5,"This CD caught my eye recently.  The Collectors Choice 2007 reissue of this 1957 album is well done with sound fidelity excellent from the original recording and bearing the original artwork.  From Durham, North Carolina, the liner notes tell of Clyde's early days of singing in churches that blossomed into his work with The Dominos and then The Drifters.  The opening track \\""Without Love (There Is Nothing)\\"" has Clyde's booming vocals.  Yes, this music is dated, no question.  However, taken on its own terms, it is compelling.  It's easy to see Clyde's voice bringing audiences to their feet when he sings, \\""I conquered the world, but what did I have?  Without love, I had nothing at all.\\""  \\""Treasure of Love\\"" is another lovely song that lets me peek at Clyde's gospel roots, \\""The treasure of love is found on no chart, to find where it is, just look in your heart.\\""  The Drifters' doo-wop version of \\""White Christmas\\"" set the familiar Bing Crosby recording on its head, launching the recording as one of the most often recorded Christmas songs.  Ivory Joe Hunter penned \\""I Make Believe\\""; Clyde milks the melodramatic breakup track to sublime 50s perfection.  The blues-inflected \\""Warm Your Heart\\"" reads well these 50+ years later with Clyde's vocals urgent and aching, \\""I want to make you so happy, that's all I'm living for.\\""  \\""The landlord rang my front door bell, I let him ring for a long long spell, I went to the window, peeked through the blind and asked him to tell me what was on his mind,\\"" Clyde sings on the delightful 50s rocker \\""Money Honey.\\""  \\""Whatcha Gonna Do\\"" is another classic track with an addictive melody, \\""What you gonna say if I hold your hand; Will you look me in the eyes and say I'm your lover man?\\""  The set ends with the delightfully dated 50s rocker \\""Thirty Days.\\""  With tracks like \\""Such a Night\\"" and \\""Honey Love,\\"" \\""Rock & Roll\\"" is a wonderful blast from the past.  Enjoy!"
381,4,"German psychedelic / folk band's sole lp - initially saw the light of day in 1971. Tracks that I dug the most are \\""Gedanken\\"" (English translation: Mind), the simply beautiful \\""Gitarrenstuck\\"" (trans: Guitar Stuck) and a couple of awesome epics this CD has to offer - the nine-minute \\""Schmetterling\\"" (translation: Butterfly) and the eight-minute \\""Nossa Boba\\"". Yet, another over-looked gem that many fans of the krautrock (and / or) psychedelic genre should enjoy. Line-up: Jenni Schucker - flute & vocals, Willi Kismer - guitar, zither & vocals, Lutz Ringer - bass & metallophon, Mike Hellbach - congas, tablas & mellotron and Peter Bursch - acoustic guitar, sitar, flute & vocals. Recommended for fans of EMTIDI, Annexus, Hoelderlin and possibly (don't hold me to it) Eela Craig. Definitely, an acquired taste."
382,5,"'Jubilees Of Zion' marked a slight change in production for Midnite and in doing so began to demonstrate the power and quality of what Midnite are capable of in the studio.  After recording the staggering CD 'Ras Mek Peace' in the US, Midnite returned to their home of St Croix to record 'Jubilees...' The result is a luscious, expansive recording with basslines that bubble and simmer and coax the listener into an almost trance-like state whilst Vaughn Benjamin delivers some of the heaviest Rasta lyrics you are likely to find anywhere.  The expansive, hypnotic rhythms continue, alongside the messages of peace, universal brotherhood, and cultural resistance to Babylon.<br /><br />'Jubilees of Zion' is not Ras Mek Peace part 2, so those looking for that raw edgy sound will be disappointed but for those prepared to put in the effort, 'Jubilees of Zion' will continue provide you with rewards and still does today some ten years after its initial release."

384,4,"The standard square box contains separate soft plastic sleeves in which the cds are inserted. The advantage is that the cds are well protected (minor risk for scrapes compared to cardboard), but there is no information printed on the sleeve since it is made of plastic. There is some basic information printed on each cd (name, composer, cd #, the act/s and the date of the recording). There is also a small 24pg booklet that introduces the box including some photos as well as content description for each disc (opera, singers, time and location as well as a list of the separate tracks). I have been collecting these boxes for a while and always find it worthwhile as there are gems nicely interspersed in these collections.<br /><br />Borodin:<br />Prince Igor<br />Moscow, 1951<br />Andrei Ivanov (Prince Igor), Mark Reizen (Khan Konchak), Alexander Priogov (Galitsky), Evgenia Smolenskaya (Yaroslavna)<br />Alexander Melik-Pashayev<br /><br />Mussorgsky:<br />Boris Godunov<br />Moscow, 1948<br />Alexander Pirogov (Boris), Bronislava Zlatogorova (Feodor), Elena Kruglikova (Xenia), Evgenia Verbitzkaya (Nurse)<br />Nikolai Golovanov<br /><br />Rimsky Korsakov:<br />Sadko (opera)<br />Moscow, 12th November 1964<br />Vladimir Petrov (Sadko), Vera Firsova (Volkhova), Larissa Andrejeva (Lyubava), Valentina Levko (Nezhata)<br />Evgeny Svetlanov<br /><br />Tchaikovsky:<br />Eugene Onegin<br />Moscow, 1956<br />Eugene Belov (Onegin), Galina Vishnevskaya (Tatyana), Sergei Lemeshev (Lensky), Ivan Petrov (Gremin)<br />Boris Khaikin<br /><br />Tchaikovsky:<br />Pique Dame<br />Moscow, 1940<br />Xenia Derzhinskaya (Lisa), NIkander Khanaev (Hermann), Bronislava Zlatgorova (Countess), Alexander Baturin (Tomsky)<br />Samuel Samosud"
385,5,"I can only second the lead reviewer's enthusiasm. I had known some of Simone Young's Bruckner recordings already and had a good opinion of her.  Not good enough, apparently. This Sym. #3 in the original edition is a one-off.  Everything is so deeply felt that we could be in the presence of Tennstedt or Barbirolli. Her old-fashioned style is as warm-hearted as theirs, her ideas completely personal, her orchestra as involved as any I've ever heard in Bruckner. A word in the ear is offered to anyone who loves this composer and has been waiting for a great performance to redeem the awkward but lovable Third. For once, every note in the score is fully justified.<br /><br />My only reservation is that through two-channel stereo, this SACD recording places the strings too far back -- the violin figure that opens the first movement is much too recessive, a fault that may not appear in surround sound. the opening of the Scherzo is a bit rackety, but the real musical flaw -- the overly long, wandering Adagio -- isn't Young's fault. Fascinating as the 1873 version may be, later revisions definitely helped to improve the Third."
386,5,"this was Roxette's first album together and i love it, there was lots of passion in this CD, how did i miss it years ago when it came out."
387,1,If I could give this a 0 rating I would. I read the reviews and couldn't wait to buy it and listen to it. I listened to every second of the entire cd. Seemed like five hours. I literally was wondering if it would ever be over. This cd is soooo overprocessed that you can't even tell that it's Britany Spears singing. There is not one single song that I have any desire to hear again.
388,5,"Being a keyboardist, I am quite familiar with the physical and emotional faculties required to play Scarlatti both on the harpsichord and piano. Sergei Babayan shows great sensitivity to dynamics, choice of tempo, phrasing, and infuses almost every sonata with wonderful inflections and flair that enhance the dancing feeling of this ethereal music. There is no question that he has a very developed technique and otherworldly trills that he puts to good use, never giving the impression of trying too much, never becoming overbearing.    I strongly recommend this recording to anyone who wants to be transported to the dancing world of Scarlatti. To me, Babayan's reading of Scarlatti is an order of magnitude more charming and tasteful than that of his teacher, the great pianist Mikhail Pletnev."
389,5,"hilarys 2ed cd let me just say its amazing and i loved it so much. but i must say to me this cd seems more teenagersh then the last one but its still good. my fav tracks are Someone's Watching Over Me,wired,the getaway,whos that girl,and i am. this album as so many good songs so heres my track by track.    fly: 9/10    do you want me: 8/10    wired: 10/10    hied away: 9/10    Mr. James Dean: 3/10 sorry but this song dosent work for her :(    Underneath This Smile: 10/10    Dangerous to Know: 8/10    whos that girl: 10/10    shine: 10/10    i am: 10/10    the getaway: 10/10    cry: 9/10    haters: 7/10    rock this world: 7/10    Someone's Watching Over Me: 10/10    Jericho: 10/10    the last song: 10/10    ok so this album is so good i strongly think all pop/rock lovers should try this out i know im glad i did"

391,5,"This is my favorite Pink Floyd album. There, I said it. I went that far. I bought this CD second-hand when I was 15, along with half a dozen other Pink Floyd and Roger Water´s CDs, and I gave them all a fair chance, since I knew nothing of the band (I think they were \\""More\\"", \\""Animals\\"", \\""Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\"", \\""Amused to Death\\"", \\""Atom Heart Mother\\"" and \\""Sourceful of Secrets\\"".  The other CDs were played from time to time, just because I wanted to find something great in them, but it turns out that only Meddle kept going back frequently to my discman. I couldn´t decide what I enjoyed more, the collection of mellow songs from the first side, all very tight, or the long, dreamy suite, tempered with the dazzling melody line.   I later got acquainted with Dark Side and The Wall, and my admiration for the band only grew. I agree that their best individual track is Wish You Were Here. But I never understood why I am maybe the single soul to put like this album above all others. My family keeps on playing Pulse or trying to make me like Roger Water´s solo career. But I am happy listening to San Tropez and Echoes over and over again.    That said, the cover is lousy."
392,5,"QUIET RIOT, Muki's second full-length, shows a remarkable improvement on their first, both in terms of sound and sophistication. Right off the bat, \\""Munk Funk\\"" shoots into a tasty jazz groove, followed the delicate and touching cover of \\""I Don't Want To Know.\\"" There's more of a downtempo focus here, which suits the band well, as do the addition of vocals. The title track swings from low-key to upbeat with organic grace. \\""Funky Sofa\\"" is the epitome of late-night, while \\""Floating\\"" goes for more funk. The Latin flavor of \\""Spin Dry\\"" stays light, rather than falling into clich&eacute;, and \\""Judy\\"" enters out-and-out soul. Finally, \\""Airborne\\"" and \\""Ghost\\"" close the album in a mournful drift, ending a marvelous musical journey."
393,5,"Keith Jarrett's The Melody at Night With You is a magnificent collection of piano music.  My Wild Irish Rose is one I love to listen to; all the music is relaxing, especially in the evening.  I am embarrassed to say I didn't know Keith Jarrett's before now!!"
394,1,Horrible!! Not the original artists and so poorly done by whomever that it is glaringly obvious. Do not waste your money. If you want good sports music stick to ESPN series of CDs. This album is not worth the cost of postage.
395,5,"This is simply a rock classic from a classic band at their peak, I am surprised to see any alice fan give this one less than five stars though. But the lowest here is a three star! and that says it all, this is a true classic rocker that lays down solid shock rock like 'halo of flies' and 'dead babies' and then slams forward with  great songs that were at least big fm radio hits 'under my wheels' and 'be my lover' two 'hits' imo by any standard. That's quite good for a band that was like a horror movie made into music! That's what alice cooper the band was and this wasn't just alice , he had a talented band of stalwarts all the way. One has sadly passed away since then but the great tunes live on and any metal or hard rock fan should add this one to their classic metal mix."
396,5,"Although there are many words that could attempt to describe this album's magnificence, none of them could possibly do the album justice.  As Linkin Park has evolved, so has its music.  Linkin Park has done it, again."
397,5,"As I write this, I'm listening to the first composition on this disc, \\""El Amor Brujo.\\""  I was delighted to find a recording of the Eugence Ormandy and Philadelphia Orchestra recording with Shirley Verret.  It is another in the list of my favorite LPs I am trying to replace.  This wonderful disc also contains Nights in the Gardens of Spain and the Three Cornered Hat, all by Manuel De Falla.  I love them all and this is a great recording."
398,5,"This is the 2nd copy I have ordered.My grandchildren love it so much,I had to get one for each.The seller was accurate with their description and shipped quickly."
399,3,"I've always had an affinity for \\""Flesh & Blood\\"" even though, historically, this is ( I think) considered a weak-for-Roxy-music work.<br /><br />Before \\""Flesh & Flood\\"", Roxy Music was a daring, innovative and very creative band. With top notch musicians like Brian Neo, Andy McCay, and Phil Manzanera these guys put out slightly pretentious but always musically bold tunes.<br /><br />I'm no Roxy Music authority, but it seems as though they were jumping on the new wave, late 70's David Bowie movement. These songs sound sterile, too smooth, too syncopated and with detached-sounding vocals. A lot different from the funk of \\""Love is the Drug\\"" or organized chaos of \\""Virginia Plain\\"". In hindsight, \\""Flesh and Flood\\"" sounds like where Bryan Ferry went with his solo works.<br /><br />However, what differentiates \\""Flesh and Blood\\"" is exactly why I like it. I think this has a certain hip sound that has endured.<br /><br />The opening song has always blown me away becaus eit's so different. I'm a huge soul fan and Wilson Pickett's \\""Midnight Hour\\"" is one of the most soulful songs ever. Roxy Music's cover of this classic renders the tune entirely souless, with such detached vocals, and such processed instrumentation that the song sounds Gary Numan-esque...and I like it. The song has been transformed so much that it does not, in any way, resemble the original and therefore a comparison is wholly inapplicable. It's cool sounding on it's own. The introduction is a spaced out countdown that then breaks into a slow, groove-oriented song. Whereas the song typically is a horn driven one, Roxy's has a huge bottom end.<br /><br />Likewise, the other cover of \\""Eight Miles High\\"" is also so distinguishable from the familiar Byrds' version, that it is interesting on it's own.<br /><br />\\""Over You\\"" is the highlight with it's highly melodic guitar coupled with pulsating drums and bass. It's among the group's best songs. I think the song is very influenced by the new wave sound that dominated pop music at the time this came out. The sax outro is unexpected yet beautiful. \\""Same Old Scene\\"" is a strong dance number that would not be surprising if the song was played at a disco. \\""Oh yea\\"" is a very slow moving ballad but with a big, rewarding chorus. \\""Flesh and Blood\\"" is also a high quality song in an unusual time signature.<br /><br />With four excellent originals and two worthwhile covers, \\""Flesh and Flood\\"" is able to compete with any of Roxy's earlier albums except for one thing...I hate the production on this album. There is hardly any variation of sound for any of the band members...the vocals are overprocessed and detached and the guitars are too metalic sounding (meaning you willnot hear any acoustic sounds or the organic simplicity of a guitar plugged straight into an amp)  making all the songs sounding too sonically similar...not in melody but in texture.<br /><br />For the unfamiliar, a compilation takes the best from this but this is nonetheless a good album, very representative (yet not realy that dated sounding) of the era.s unexpected yet beautiful. \\""Same Old Scene\\"" is a strong dance number that would not be surprising if the song was played at a disco. \\""Oh yea\\"" is a very slow moving ballad but with a big, rewarding chorus. \\""Flesh and Blood\\"" is also a high quality song in an unusual time signature.

400,4,one tenor song did not fit the rest of the album.Poetry and boleros not my thing either. Instrumental was very good.The rest of the album and the orchestras very good also.
401,5,"The Clancy Bothers and Tommy Makem added a dimension to their performamces that most other artists avoided or ignored and that was engaging their audience in a virtual dialogue. Making \\""wise-cracks\\"", swapping punch lines and having plenty of \\""sing-a-longs. This album captures that marvelous, magical interplay. They were all actors originally and brought this experience along with them in their poetic recitations and quotations from literature and the theatre.    This album will not disappoint a CBTM fan or any lover of true, traditional Irish Folk  Music."
402,5,"Do you want to bring peace to your soul?  I love Stanton Lanier's \\""Unveiled.\\""  Every song is beautiful!  What talent!"
403,5,"I bought two of these cd's, one for my daughter-in-law and of course, one for myself.  This one had so many of my favorite songs on it and I play it all the time.  The talent of these kids is amazing. I especially like to play it when I'm cleaning the house - it keeps me moving and smiling all the way through!!"
404,3,"This CD. sounds worse than many of REO's songs I have heard  either on the radio, on on DVD. I am surprised because Sony,  [whose Audio CD-R's I use for clients]should know better.  There is something not quite right with the sound quality.    In the case of the song [for example]'Can't fight this feeling'  there seems to be a section of piano playing missing. Or it  is only on the 12\\"" extended mix?? [nigh impossible to get hold  of] Does anyone have one? Well at least the manic guitarist  sounds good.[Even though he looks dis-interested on stage].    REO Speedwagon have millions of fans, due to their constant  touring back in the day, and have sold millions of records.  If you are a true \\""Speedwagon\\"" type of guy or girl, I would  recommend you stay away from this compilation. There's lot's  to choose from in the Amazon REO marketplace.    Merry Christmas."
405,5,"He used to be the lead singer at a Bible camp that I went to and was great. His CD is amazing also. Stirs the soul, great praise music. Defiantly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a powerful cd."
406,5,"I liked it the first time I listen to In The Skyline\\"" but after the third time I was really in love with all the songs, excellent music and letters. I think Andrea Wittgens have an amazing talent and this CD is a great example."
407,5,"I love this two disc set, don't get me wrong. It has nearly every one of my favorite songs by Selena on it, including the bonus live disc which made me cry when I realized what it was. However, this set doesn't have any of her early songs on it. Despite this, a truly wonderful set that is a can't miss. If you're looking for a great starter set or a set full of memories, get this now."
408,4,"This album has been around for a while, but I only recently got around to getting a copy, after having enjoyed Soul Circus for quite a while.    There is a real evolution in Wooten's song writing and playing. This is a guy who is not only a fantastic player, but who can write catchy tunes and someone who has really spent some time thinking about life. All this comes out in Palmystery, which is a wonderful album."
409,4,"Just listen to three songs and you'll be hooked. Louie's \\""Rise\\"", \\""We Don't Have To Change\\"" , and the Doug Sahm penned \\"" Spread Some Love Around\\"". Like other Chicano artist's they have the knack of utilising and incorporating the musical influences they were raised with. Pop, Rock, Funk, Country, Soul,and Traditional Mexican music. Why not Five stars? Because they are so varied their group sound drifts. Fun listening for people who appreciate versatility."
410,5,The Sings your Favorites album is very good and worth the price alone.  Good STEREO sound quality.
411,4,"A couple quick notes on this album:    -I loved most of Ben Folds' earlier material, but I must admit that I was so disappointed after purchasing \\""Way to Normal\\"" I threw it in a drawer and forgot it existed for two full years.  His creative spark seemed to have dwindled, perhaps died altogether.      -After hearing the single \\""From Above\\"" on NPR I was stoked enough to give him another chance.  Mainly, I was intrigued by the original concept he and Nick Hornby used to co-create \\""Lonely Avenue.\\""  I'm not a particularly huge fan of \\""High Fidelity\\"", but I just liked the idea of B.F. essentially being 'commissioned' to write music to fixed lyrics.      -The result works fairly well: the lyrics are definitely fresh (compared to recent B.F. efforts), and the music fits appropriately.      -Musically, several of the songs aren't terribly to my liking, but there were highlights - 'Doc Pomus', 'Claire's Ninth', and 'From Above'.  The 'buzzy', distored bass is almost entirely absent from this album, and while synth-ey effects are featured on several songs, it's not as overpowering as on \\""Way to Normal\\"".  Overall, the entire album has a smoother, more polished feel, and is more piano-centric - especially thrilling on 'Claire's Ninth'.  Lyrically, it's a bit too gloomy for my taste these days.  This has always been his characteristic (and this time he's not the one responsible for the lyrics anyway), so it's more a matter of my personal taste changing than anything.    -In the end, I bought it mostly for the originality of the concept and the hope that it would produce refreshing results, and it is that originality that impresses me more-so than the actual music itself, leading me to give it such a favorable rating.  And something tells me this album will age reasonably well, but we'll see...    I hope this is review provides accurate and helpful analysis for you!"
412,3,"I like the album.  Not love, but definitely like.  Still think her first one was better but I can't stop listening to GHOST OF YOU, SICK OF YOU, A YEAR WITHOUT RAIN and OFF THE CHAIN so...even if this it definitely NOT my style of music  (I love country, folk, acoustic) it definitely got too much a hold of me to be ignored...    AND one of you wrote she didn't write a song on this album: She wrote SPOTLIGHT on her own and co-wrote three other songs...so that makes 4 Selena written songs...the first album just had 1. That's the improvement I like most!    Thanks to [...] for this information. The list below is all of the writers for the songs that is on A Year Without Rain.

413,5,"I had never heard of Dean James until last night when I saw him at the Houston Wine Festival and if this CD is anywhere near as good as that concert, it is fantastic.  He is a master of the saxophone and his band is excellent.  I and my friend were both mesmerized.  We just laid back and took it all in.  I will be buying this CD soon."
414,5,"One day I heard a song from this soundtrack online and realized I had lost my original Jawbreaker soundtrack.<br />So, I HAD to order it. I love every song.<br />One of those cds, where i never skip any of the songs."
415,4,I wanted everlast so i picked this album and started wearin my hat flat billed &to the side.
416,5,"My brother gave me this CD years ago. It came attached to a large tin holding a candle. It was lost when I moved, but I recently found it in a box of odd things and put it in the CD player. It's the most beautiful and haunting collection I own and I have quite a few CD's of Celtic music. If you like Loreena McKennitt, John Doan, Enya, or Michael and Jeff Dana, you'll love this. Since digging it out, I play it over and over. It's very relaxing, and the songs have a kind of unpretenious innocence that I love."
417,5,"I love the soundtrack. For 500 Days of Summer fans like myself, (I've seen the movie more than a few times,) each song is representative of a certain segment of the movie- easily visualized by the colorful soundtrack. The songs stretch across genre and create a wonderful playlist for a great movie. I definitely recommend purchasing the soundtrack. It was great to hear the catchy songs from the movie in their entirety. The only disappointing factor of the CD for me was that Zooey's karaoke \\""Sugar Town\\"" was not included on the soundtrack. Tom's song \\""Here Comes Your Man,\\"" is on the soundtrack, but it isn't sung by him."
418,3,"Sarah Mclachlan's voice is soft, smooth and easy to listen to while engaged in other duties. The beat is clear and mellow. Some of the themes of the songs are very close and at one point, two songs blended together with no clear distinction. There is a choice between the song, \\""Loving You is Easy\\"", and the song, \\""Awakenings\\"", as to which song is the best."
419,3,"Pretty voice, catchy melodies, beautifully recorded, competent songwriting.  The problem for me is simply that music to accompany meditation through chanting is boring and superfluous."
420,2,"Marc Anthony has an extraordinary voice and I buy all of his recordings,  this one is not as good as others, still a pleasure to listen to his voice  though."
421,5,"It may be a few years between releases, but \\""Red Dissolving Rays of Light\\"" was most definitely worth the wait.  Eleven new tracks are to be found here, not a one of which is filler.  The guitars of Chris Marsteller and Marc Schroeder drive the band while vocalist/songwriter Mike Stax belts out the lyrics.  Hard as it is to believe, the disc contains pedal steel guitar work by Glenn Ross Campbell of the legendary 60s psych band, The Misunderstood.  His work on the title track and \\""Heyday\\"" show that Campbell is as exciting as ever.  The accompanying booklet contains the lyrics to the tunes, all written and arranged by the band.  The only shortcoming I see here, if it is a shortcoming at all, is that there are no sleeve notes in the booklet.  But whatever you do don't let that stop you from procuring this devilishly great cd.  The cd opens with the garage classic \\""Between Grey Slates\\"" with its driving beat and Stax's mantra like repitition of the title.  \\""I Wanna Get You\\"" opens with guitars feeding back and never slows down.  Its a shame that The Loons only release a new cd every five years or so, but this may indeed be their best release ever.  If you are a fan of garage/psych rock it is absolutely essential that you seek out and procure all three of The Loons cds.  Released on the famous Bomp label this cd is an instant classic and is proof positive that the music of the 1960s lives on.  Pick up this release ASAP to ensure there will be further releases by Mr. Stax and Co.  Long live The Loons!"
422,4,"One eskimO  self titled  One eskimO    The music on this cd is breathy, laid back, simple, and sultry, all in one.  The song Hometime, when I play it, freaks out one of my cats!  She starts crying, then jumps around.  The song Kandi, is my favorite.  The first time I heard it, I thought it was a good song.  Then I watched the season finale of the tv show Bones, and I fell in love with it!  At the end of the show, it showed  Bones & Sealy saying goodbye for a year.  They looked into the others eyes, and you can hear the song in the background.  You think that they will finally kiss, but they do not.  I hit the dvr several times just to listen to the song, then realized I had heard it before.  It was in my stereo waiting to e reviewed!  And yes, I did receive the cd at no cost to review.  So when you listen to the cd, play it a few times, and give it a chance!    The band has been on the Ellen show, the song Hometime was in a Toyota commercial, and the song Kandi, is a #1 radio hit song!  So I'm sure they will be around for a long time, and I look forward to hearing much more from them!"
423,2,"some of these versions are the same as the previously released \\""Johnny Winter And Live\\"" record. the rest sound like out takes. poor mixes, possibly F.O.H. board mixes, don't do the band justice. i love this particular line up with johnny, but was disappointed with this. highway 61 is good, but there are so many good versions of that song. if you don't have \\""Johnny Winter And Live\\"", buy that instead. just an opinion."
424,5,"Confession: I have all the original CDs. In fact, I started buying Al-bums when they were vinyl, Al's first few records came out before CDs were generally available, I had to buy the CD versions later.  Like when the Beatles remasters came out recently, true fans will listen extremely closely to both old and new versions.  Is Jim's guitar a little stronger here?  What about the detail in Bermuda's drumming?  Changes that seem too subtle to notice are really important to us Al-aholics.  I wouldn't take a chance on the digital downloads, some detail could be lost in the conversion to MP3.  As a fan who already has all the CDs (along with Jim's and Steve's solo ventures), I have an answer to those who argue about which songs were selected as essential, and which were left out:  Buy them all, including this compilation.  Then dare to compare, sort of like wondering whether Disneyland or Disney World has the best \\""Pirates of the Caribbean\\"" -- not to mention the foreign versions (of either the Disney rides or Al's songs) -- will Al release the exact same versions in Australia, or should I also buy these releases as well?  Maybe this is a bit extreme, but as I line up my trips to Disney parks in France, Japan and China, \\""Jurassic Park\\"" plays in the background.  I hope I can take in one of Al's Costa Mesa shows on my way to Tokyo Disneyland."
425,4,It makes me happy... I listen to it a lot.  It should be the soundtrack for a Super Mario Brothers movie.
426,5,this is a collection of total sing-a-long songs! I love it!  and the remix is amazing -good match up!
427,5,"I just love MGMT's music and their new album is great. You get a combination of psychadellic, strange and haunting songs that are a nice throwback to the 1960s/70s. I've listened to the album multiple times now and each time I appreciate it more."
428,5,this is definitely not new age fluff  it could be hundreds of years old   the bowls produce a very detached state of mind  centered - the deepest bowl seems to arise from inside     easy to slip into samadhi of the void with this
429,4,"I bought this CD set because I had enjoyed so much the LP recording of \\""Orpheus in the Underworld\\"" I bought back in the seventies. I had assumed the other two operas would be as enjoyable, but they were a disappointment. However, the CDs are worth buying just for \\""Orpheus\\"" - hilariously funny libretto, great melodies, and glorious singing from the Sadler's Wells cast. Just a pity that Offenbach seems to have run out of ideas when he wrote the other two."
430,4,"Nice collaboration by these three very talented musicians (Homme, Grohl, and Jones). There are some awesome riffs throughout the entire CD. The songs are deeply layered with music. Homme's soft oh-ah voice compliments the music nicely. Fun CD. Maybe 2 or 3 songs to long, but it starts off great (first track is my favorite) and ends great."
431,5,"I'll admit I'm a latecomer to The Town Pants as I only met this group in September 2009 live at Loon Mountain, New Hampshire.  Their GREAT performance mostly included songs from Piston Baroque and their newest cd, Shore Leave and had the crowd singing along and up dancing. Their Shore Leave cd had sold out during their concert the previous night, so at that time I had to go to their official site to get a copy - well worth it! They provided a lively end-of-the-evening concert and were paired with Albannach (which I suspect most of the crowd were there to see).  Their music provides good storytelling (and drinking songs) in current Celtic/Folk tradition.  Good sing-along songs.  Too bad they hail from Vancouver - I would like to catch their live act more often on the US east coast!  Especially like \\""Come with Me\\"", \\""Dark Annie\\"", \\""Unidentified Friend\\"", \\""Coming Home\\"", and \\""Drinking in the Graveyard\\"".  Good vocals and excellent musicians - a little bit of everything for the modern-day Celtic listeners - much better than anything on the radio!  Recommend Piston Baroque and Shore Leave as my favorites.  Their cd \\""Coming Home\\"" is also worth buying and includes \\""Galway Girl\\"", a must have favorite song of several groups of this genre. Very talented group."
432,5,"The first thing that stands out on the first couple of listens is Jonas Renkse's amazing vocals. This partly stems from the fact that he has written nine of the eleven songs by himself, thus rendering it almost a solo album in a sense. This may lead one to think that the songs on this disc are somewhat samey offering little variation in their context. However, that is certainly not the case. The Katatonia sound is still intact here -- this album has such an emotional attachment to it, and its most rewarding moments have been hidden for the attentive listener.<br /><br />It is only with repeat listens that the rest of the album reveals itself, hence why it seems less accessible than its predecessor, the incredibly amazing The Great Cold Distance. Where the previous album was a display of dynamics focusing on complex rhythmic patterns and nimble drumming, Night is the New Day is a thorough study in pure atmosphere. Tracks may seem rather one-dimensional in the beginning, but that is more likely the result of being engulfed by Renkse's otherworldly singing. This album is his pinnacle from a vocal standpoint, his deep, breathy, sparse vocals take on almost hypnotizing quality on each track, drawing you into the compositions like never before. He has never channeled so much colour and palpable emotion into his songs as he has on this album.<br /><br />The songs have more resolution and character, and the compositions are more amorphous. The band no longer opts for the crushing quiet/loud dynamics heard on the previous disc. There is no effort to create huge, catchy choruses either, as each track on this disc is informed by pure, hollow emotion. Don't expect any choruses to leap out at you. It's not that there aren't any catchy vocal parts. On the contrary, they are in great abundance here. They have just been built into the tracks without stealing away from the rest of the composition. On \\""Inheritance\\"", for instance, Renkse delivers the ultimately gripping chorus only towards the end of the composition. He sings: \\""Let them inherit this fire now | Lest they will forget that we were ever here.\\"" This just feels so right in the context of the song as it follows the tense trip-hop beats and precedes Nystrom's beautiful guitar theme -- and yet it stays with you for days on end.<br /><br />The same thing applies to \\""New Night\\"" or \\""The Longest Year\\"", which would be a great representation of the current Katatonia sound. With its ever shifting dynamics (easily the best Katatonia production!), nuanced drumming, sparse yet supremely melodic vocal lines, this is one of their most patient and complete songs in their career. The passage where the analog synth note is held and streteched just after the first chorus is simply spellbinding. There is a wealth of nuance and subtlety to discover here, as the inner-song structures are actually smoother than ever.<br /><br />This is not to say Night is the New Day consists of tracks alike. \\""Liberation\\"" marries electronic elements with thick yet organic sounding guitars while \\""Idle Blood\\"" recalls Opeth circa Damnation for its finger-picking acoustic guitars, harmonized vocals, and depth of the keys. Again, the guitar theme on this song is absolutely masterful. \\""Forsaker\\"" stands out for its use of heavy guitar riffs and laidback verses, not to mention the great guitar tone and Rhodes piano in the mix.<br /><br />\\""Nephilim\\"" is the band's doomiest composition in years, perhaps since Brave Murder Day. Its huge, sludgy cascades of riffs and guitar feedback make it the darkest and most sinister number on the album, but the band prevent it from breaking the album's flow, as they insert weird, theatrical vocal melodies at the end -- I could swear there is a female vocalist singing along with Renkse in the outro, but the CD booklet won't confirm my theory.<br /><br />Enter The Hunt's Krister Linder appears on the final song \\""Departer\\"", easily the most moving track on the album. It is a very atmospheric song with an abundance of synth layers and Linder takes over the second half of the song concluding it with utmost emotion.<br /><br />Kudos to Katatonia for not succumbing to the loudness war, and producing such an album. David Castillo's mix and engineering as well as Jens Bogren's mastering are in one word perfect. The level of detail in the songs is stunning and the album has more character in this respect than any other Katatonia release prior. Also, the artwork and packaging are great. I especially love the jewel case -- it's like Steven Wilson's solo album but comes in a cool cardboard box.<br /><br />Mikael Akerfeldt certainly wasn't exaggerating when he proclaimed Night is the New Day \\""the greatest heavy record in the last ten years\\"". Indeed, this is Katatonia's new masterpiece and it is bound to unlock new horizons for them. I can't wait to see what direction they will take with their next album.kes over the second half of the song concluding it with utmost emotion.

433,5,"Edgardo and Candela have been around for a while.  Their music is great.  It is such a gumbo different Latin styles, just like the band.  This is a must for any Latin music library."
434,5,I went to the actual concert and this product captures the performance with great detail and has great new live versions of all your favorite songs. A must buy for any beatles fan.
435,5,Everything Bud powell does is magic! If I could just play like this for one day in my life I would be happy.
436,5,This was great!  The Kids are learning through music to about the books of the Bible.  My kids like the music for the New Testament alot.  But they enjoyed the CD all the time we are with them.
437,5,"The cd was everything I expected it to be.  The music is fantastic, it was like seeing the show all over again.  I love it!"
438,1,"If you're wondering why your mother or your grandfather raves about this obscure singer/songwriter, don't go here to find out. Check out \\""The Many Sides of Fred Neil\\"" and the \\""Bleecker & McDougal/Tear Down the Walls\\"" sets. This contains very early, hokey country-style productions that don't in any way reflect what made Fred great.    You might want this disc if you're a fanatic Fred Neil completist. I consider myself one, but even I can't stomach this one."
439,1,"never received my CD, it's been a month. I wrote the company by e-mail a week age and never got a reponce as of 12/ 26/09"
440,5,"This is an absolute classic album! I sampled this constantly in the 70's, particularly at pub gigs, where everyone was in stitches.    I note one person bought this thinking it was a serious collection of Idi Amin speeches, then panned it here??    Sorry, I just can't take that kind of criticism seriously... particularly since it mentions that comedian John Bird is the featured voice and it's likely Idi Amin would have had any person writing \\""De Amazing Bootblack Recording\\"" on one of his own albums shot! :)    It fabulous satire so lighten up everyone, otherwise your grandmothers will be taken seriously ill! :)"
441,4,"If you know Pavlov's Dog, there is no need to discuss this album - buy it. Maybe it's not equal to their first -\\""Pampered Menial\\"" (which was a concept album)[[ASIN:B00006O9U9 Pampered Menial]], but this is the famous, long-awaited legal release of their THIRD ALBUM (it was dropped by the record company and a bootleg was around for a long time, usually labelled \\""St.Louis Hounds\\""). If you don't know \\""Pavlov's Dog\\"", you should listen to, because David Surcamp had (and still has*)an unusual voice of unique power, ranging from mesmerizing charm to piercing scream of lost soul in hell. Pavlov's Dog  was a heavy psychedelic band (what they call now \\""stoner\\""), with complicated, beautiful and original music (\\""Menial\\"" should be in the list of Top 100 albums - next to King Crimson and Rare Bird). It is recommended at least to learn about exceptional level of creativity. You might not like it, but you must know it.* David Surkamp's solo album of 2007 is also worth having[[ASIN:B001TW6930 Dancing on the Edge of a Teacup]]"
442,5,"The title of the book gives away the contents. I bought the CD because I have an hour commute to work and don't want to waste time on traffic reports. This was a big mistake for this book unless you have extraordinary powers of visualization. The descriptions are quite clear; however it is like following a map of Europe in your mind and never seeing the original map. The book is quite clear and after reading it you say \\""Now why did I not think of that?\\""<br /><br />After reading the book (that comes packaged with the CD's) the CD's quit helpful in pronouncing words and you can then remember the diagrams you saw. They add a demotion to this collection that is worth the cost; yet, the CD's can not substitute for the book."
443,3,"Let me start by saying that this is a pretty good CD, and by no means do I regret buying it. The only reason it gets only 3 stars is because Birdman himself has completely run out of stuff to say, and is totally outshined by every guest appearance on the album (with the exception of Kevin Rudolph, WTF were they thinking?!) Weezy, as always has some clever and memorable verses, Drake has some hot verses, plus some good guest spots by Rick Ross, Yo Gotti, and Gucci Mane. All that adds up to a pretty good CD, it's just such a shame that Birdman did not spit a single memorable verse, probably not even a single line worth highlighting. Every song is about money, literally. Im not one these anti-rap @ssholes that says that about every CD, in fact, I think there's tons of good rap out there right now in both the mainstream and underground, but all of Baby's verses sound the same on here, it's as far from groundbreaking as you can possibly get, and it's become more than obvious that Baby is just riding on Wayne's wave of success."
444,5,"This is the first album I was ever given, I received it as a christmas gift along with my first stereo. I recently added it to my CD collection and had forgotten how amazing this collection of songs is, this version is even more amazing due to the sound quality. It is for the most part dark and melancholy but has its bright spots and all of the songs are a necessary part of the whole. This is an epic album and I believe essential for any classic rock collection. I believe this is his best work to date."
445,5,"very best is the best way to describe this cd, id recomend this to any psycho or fan of good pure psychobilly if you like batmobile, long tall texans, or krewmen your gonna love these guys"
446,4,"One of the better healing cds I've listened to.  I don't know if it will help with my health problem, but it is definitely calming, helps me feel more centered, and that in itself is a good thing."
447,5,Vicious Pink's self titled (and only full length LP) was never released on CD.  What a shame their music is so hard to come by because this whole LP was a virtual mainstay of club hits and really stands the test of time (the music doesn't sound dated at all).  Excellent!  Please do music lovers a favor and release this gem on CD!
448,1,"I hate being so negative about the musician that produced Plug Me Into Something, one of the greatest rock albums ever recorded.  But it seems that since his sappy song Shannon was more successful than anything else that he ever did, he continues in that vein.  You can listen to MP3 sound samples here on Amazon, and can buy the CD at Henry's website, but I didn't hear even one song that was iPod-worthy."
449,5,One of my all time favorite albums by one of my all time favorite groups
450,5,"Although this cd is almost 20 years old.....I STILL LOOOOOVE IT! If only a lot of the overrated singers of today had a tenth of her talent! Whew! This lady can sang! It is a cd I can listen to over and over again and never get sick of hearing it. I enjoy the mix of chill out, upbeat and sentimental songs. Her voice is clear and distinct. Even if you can't sing one note this cd will make you think you can. I always sing along and swear I can hit all of her high notes! LOL!! I love the whole cd, but here is a list of my faves: Welcome to My Love, Waiting, With Open Arms, 'Til You Come Back, You Can't Get....nevermind, I love the whole thing. Buy this cd!You won't regret your decision!!!"
451,5,"GREAT CD!  I LOVE EVERY SONG, EACH SONG IS BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN!  CRISETTE MICHELE REMINDS ME OF PHYLLIS HYMAN.  CRISETTE'S VOICE IS SOFT AND SULTRY!  HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SEEING CRISETTE WITH MAXWELL IN CONCERT.........SHE WAS EXCELLENT!  I THOUGHT I WAS LISTENING TO THE ACTUAL CD, HER VOICE WAS SENSATIONAL!"
452,4,"Pop music gets a bad rap, deservedly so mostly for it's banal , safe 'n sugary sweet formulaic fluff, with canned passion and vision at best. This album , and it's predecessor, should be the model for well crafted pop music. Majestic melodies , palpable emotion, infectious grooves with such a beautifully woven cross section of influences from pop, folk, synth, emo, rock, and others that it ends up a unique, artistic sound,bigger and more important than the sum of its parts and influences. And it's cool that the Chad guy is an Okie. :P ...."
453,5,"KIRSTEN  FLAGSTAD<br /><br />A  different voice.<br /><br />Kirsten Flagstad ,the famous Norwegian singer and her magnificent and refined voice can be enjoyed in these  beautiful  songs from different composers.  I was so lucky as to have heard  personally  her degree of perfection, in  her unforgettable interpretations of  Isolde and Brunnhilde  specially  with Wilhelm Furtwangler (Teatro Colon. Buenos Aires) but I did, perhaps as most people,  ignored  Norwegian songs were part of her dearest selection.<br />We have a very good one in this CD . It starts with Schubert ( Die Forelle ) sang in her upper register, but in the rest we can listen to her sensitive and limpid voice in her normal deep usual register starting with two Beethoven pieces, one of them the unforgettable \\""Ich liebe dich\\"". Follow two songs of the same title by Grieg, well  known pieces full  of tenderness and nostalgia. She sings here the German version and  then the one in Norwegian, with depth, delicacy, serenity and that sad color of almost all Grieg music: not a small masterpiece!<br /><br />Eight other Grieg songs followed by  three of Norwegian composers. Finally \\""Meine liebe ist grun\\"" from Brahms (with words by Schumann), \\""Alerseeler\\"" by Strauss and \\""Songs my mother taught me\\"" by Dvorak. Three  songs from English composers end the cycle.<br />This simple CD is a big pleasure for her followers or from those who still do not know her different voice. It is a very delicate and beautiful present for yourself and others  you care very much."
454,5,"So I was just sitting here eating cookies and drinking some beer, when all of a sudden I came across Cassandra Syndrome's \\""Of Patriots and Tyrants\\"". The sound of Jay's drumming and the crushing notes of Joe's bass nearly toppled me out of my chair sending pabst and tagalongs hurtling through the air. I sat there on the edge of my lawn/computer chair fueled by the mixture of peanut butter, the cool refreshing taste of Milwaukee, and the tasty tunes emitting from Chris's guitar. Halfway through the album I realized I was completely out of cookies and beer. I know what you are thinking. \\""What could be better than cookies and beer?\\"" I ran to the fridge and examined the contents in the hope of finding something else that would go great with the ethereal sound of Irene's voice. Ham? No, too meaty. Pickles? Not in the mood. Pie! We all love pie! So off I run, pie in hand, to finish listening to this extraordinary album. When all was said and done I could hardly believe what I had just witnessed. A sophisticated flaky crust of pure metal with a dark cherry filling of gothic opera. This album goes great with pie and beer, but mostly cookies."
455,5,"I like Evangelion more than I like The Apostasy. This album is different from The Apostasy. I think Evangelion is better than The Apostasy. Behemoth really stepped it up on Evangelion. Behemoth has been around for a long time now. I think you'll like this album if you like death metal, and black metal. This is an album to have this year.<br />My favorite songs on Evangelion are:<br />1. Ov Fire and the Void<br />2. Transmigrating Beyond Realms ov Amenti<br />3. He Who Breeds Pestilence<br />4. The Seed ov I<br />5. Alas, Lord Is Upon Me"
456,5,"Lizzie McGuire is one of my favorite TV shows; and the movie was great ( I have it on DVD). This soundtrack is very bubble-gummy- that's how I like it! I love singing along to the songs:  1: Why Not- My all time favorite song! It has a different first verse then the version on Hilary Duff's album \\""Metamorphosis\\"" (did I spell it correctly?) I am going to perform it in a talent show soon! 5/5    2: The Tide Is High (Get The Feeling), a very good song with a goon beat. Better then the original song by Blondie. 4.5/5    3: All Around The World, too much disco and beat, sounds like it would be played in a bar or club. I like their song: \\""E is for Everybody\\"" on the Kim Possible soundtrack better. I can hardly understand the girl singing it. 3/5    4: What Dreams are Made of (Ballad Version) Very soulful, too much piano in the beginning. 4/5    5: Shining Star- I hate this song. Disney has put this song on so many different cds, by different artists, including the Hannah Montana soundtrack.    6: Volare, I love this song. Very bubble-gummy. Excellent!!    7: Open Your Eyes To Love, this song is very corny, but is alright 3/5    8: You Make Me Feel Like a Star- very good, lobe the \\""bum bum bums\\"" in the middle! 4/5    9: Supermodel, love it! so orginal. 5/5    10: What Dreams are Made of\\"" Great song and beat. 5/5    11: An Evening in Roma, alright, very old song, perfect for movie. 2/5    12: Girl in the Band. Hilary's sis sings it! Not a very good tune. 3/5    13 These are the orechestral songs in the film combined. Very relaxing. 5/5    14: Why Not (McMix) Very good remix 5/5"
457,5,"I bought this soundtrack so I could learn all the songs from the book (I'm a performer/purist about reading to my kids).  The music and production quality was far above what I expected. It's worth the price just for the fiddled \\""Irish Washer Woman\\"".  And the \\""Old Dan Tucker\\"" was the best I've ever heard.  Even better than the Bruce Springsteen version."
458,5,"This is one of those career changing albums. If it's done wrong it can ruin a career. Done right and you can become immortal. Its clear that Brad Paisley is growing up. And he shows it on this one. Gone are the days of Ticks, I'm Gonna Miss Her, and Celebrity. Honestly, I think its a welcome change. This album wont sell as much nor will it recieve the type of acclaim from fans that he recieved on his previous two....Time Well Wasted and 5th Gear.  But in my opinion, this is by far his best album in regards to his music and his writing. I think its a welcomed change and it shows just how talented this man really is."
459,1,"Fairport's early lineup, with Sandy Denny and Richard Thompson in the band were rated at the same level...    Come on...throwing superlatives at this weak collection is just plain ridiculous!    The production is \\""hot\\""---the drums and the bass very high in the mix---exactly what you DON'T want in a Fairport album....Fairport was never a \\""Hot\\"" band.  The songs are weak and the arrangements are even weaker. How can a band containing 3/4 of the Angel Delight/Babbacome Lee line up ruin a great Richard Thompson song (The Poor Ditching Boy)? Buy this wretched album and find out.  Swarb's descending scale of discordant notes does nothing but spoil a track that is barely presentable in the first place....!    Just awful!  I wish I hadn't bought this one.    \\""The Bonny Bunch of Roses\\"" track on BBC sessions was interesting...that's why I bought this record.  The version here isn't nearly as good.  Plus, I figured an album by Dave Swarbick, Simon Nicol, Dave Pegg and Bruce Rowland just coudn't be bad!  I was wrong...there's not a single decent track on this release.    Fairport Convention fans beware..."
460,5,This CD is absolutely my favorite. I'm so glad Amazon was able to help me get it as the one I had had skips in it.  A must for all Steely Dan fans!
461,5,"If you are wanting a twist on the traditional classical sounds of the oboe and english horn this is a great cd to purchase!  You will recognize some old folk song favorites, but the new pieces are the wonderful ones.  Especially good is Track #7."
462,5,"Unless you already own three or more of the six operas included in this 'splendid little box', you need to order it now, before it sells out. I've decided to review each of the six operas independently, beginning with \\""Arminio\\"", my favorite under-appreciated Handel work; that review has been posted.<br /><br />The six operas in the box are:<br />RODRIGO - 2 CDs recorded in 1999, with Gloria Banditelli, Sandrine Piau, Roberta Invernizzi<br />RADAMISTO - 3 CDs 2005, with Zachary Stains, Dominique Labelle, Joyce DiDonato<br />ADMETO - 3 CDs 1978, with Ren&eacute; Jacobs, James Bowman, Max von Egmond<br />FERNANDO - 2 CDs 2007, with Lawrence Zazzo, Max Cencic, Antonio Abete<br />ARMINIO - 2 CDs 2001, with Vivica Genoux, Dominique Labelle, Riccardo Ristori<br />DEIDAMIA - 3 CDs 2003, with Simone Kermes, Anna Bonitatibus, Furio Zanassi<br /><br />Librettos are included on a CD-rom. A helpful resource for opera recordings that come without printed notes is the collection of synopses posted by naxos.com/education/opera<br /><br />Post Script: As of July 1st, I've reviewed separately: Deidamia, Rodrigo, Radamisto, and Arminio, all splendid!"
463,5,"You do not want to miss this one. Nelly Mauras and Kurt Hawthorne's first CD is a compilation of new arrangements of classic Christian hymns and newly composed jazz tunes that will bring hours of enjoyment and relaxation to you and your loved ones. Years of hard work culminated in a masterful performance by very talented musicians. The new arrangements of God inspired classic hymns like Glorious, How great thou art, and Amazing Grace is combined with amazing original tunes like Latin Praise, Traffic Jams and many others that will have you humming them all day and bring blessings, peace and joy to your busy days. We are looking forward to their next CD. What a joy!"
464,5,"The Very Best Of Ultravox<br />CD & DVD (this is NOT a DualDisc release as stated)<br />2009 Chrysalis/EMI release<br />CD ~ 75 minutes.  Audio remastered by Steve Rooke at Abbey Road Studios in 2008 & 2009.<br />DVD ~ 73 minutes.  Region 0 (all regions).  NTSC format (not PAL format as stated on Amazon).  Aspect ratio: 4:3.  Audio:  Dolby Digital Stereo.  Produced by Abbey Road Interactive.  Steve Rooke 2008/2009 digitally remastered audio re-synced by Andrew Walter.<br />UPC:  5 099926 672229.  Made in the EU.<br /><br />I love when record labels put out these kind of sight and sound packages! The 2009 'The Very Best Of Ultravox' CD/DVD package gathers 18 U.K. hit singles on CD and 17 promo videos on DVD spanning the '80s incarnation of Ultravox -- Midge Ure, Chris Cross, Billy Currie, and Warren Cann. All four of these members reunited in early 2009 for the first time since 'Live Aid' in 1985 in order to tour the U.K. and celebrate their 30th anniversary, releasing this special collection in order to coincide with the occasion!<br /><br />The Ultravox '80s reissue campaign started in late 2008 with the 2-CD re-mastered definitive edition of 'Vienna', following with additional 2-disc editions of 'Rage In Eden', 'Quartet', and 'Monument' in early 2009. Sliding in during this campaign is this excellent sight and sound package from Chrysalis/EMI, released in April 2009. Of the 18 tracks featured on the CD a whopping 15 of them placed in the U.K. Top 40!<br /><br />I've been looking forward to this kind of package from Ultravox for quite a while now since I`m not really that familiar with their hits and back catalogue and have been curious to discover more.  One can imagine my excitement when I first read about this release.  It's not often that record companies combine stunning audio and video in one package!<br /><br />All audio tracks have been digitally re-mastered by Steve Rooke at Abbey Road Studios in 2008 and 2009. Seven-inch/single versions, mixes, and edits have been used whenever possible as well (see the tracklisting provided by Amazon), giving fans the chance to hear them as originally played on the radio and issued on 7\\"" vinyl.  It's worth noting, too, for those picky about sound quality, that the music has not been brick-walled to death, meaning that the audio is not overly loud. While everyone has different preferences when it comes to audio compression, and frankly I'm fine with brick-walled sound most of the time, the audio restoration is impeccable!<br /><br />I don't think that these recordings have ever sounded this crisp and clean.  One can hear that painstaking work went in to transferring and re-mastering this music from the original master tapes.  I really appreciate it!  The clarity of tracks like \\""All Stood Still\\"", \\""Lament\\"", and \\""The Thin Wall\\"" have left me \\""dancing with tears in my eyes\\"".<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised with the DVD as well since Abbey Road Interactive, the studio which produced this DVD and has compiled other music DVDs for the EMI branch, can be hit and miss.  While the work from this studio is almost always good sometimes videos are not all presented in their best audio and visual form.  Fortunately, all promo videos have been re-synced with the 2008/2009 digitally re-mastered audio, and video quality, considering the age, is good as well.<br /><br />On another note, this DVD is actually NTSC format, not PAL format as stated by Amazon (thanks to Brendan for pointing this out to me!)  I had the privilege of watching these promos on a big screen plasma tv and was quite surprised at how grainy some of the earlier videos are.  It's different watching them on a huge screen versus a laptop screen.  Maybe the quality has something to do with the conversion to NTSC from PAL, the standard format in which these videos were recorded.  I would be curious to know what kind of, if any, effect that this conversion had on the quality. For a European release why weren't these presented in PALanyway?  That's the standard format!<br /><br />I am no visual expert, but based on other promos that I've viewed on similar releases of this era they all still look about as good as I have expected them to be.  I am not expecting the clear and vibrant picture of today's standards because it is simply not present on the original tapes.  Having these promos, including the uncut clip of \\""Vienna\\"" and the uncensored cut of \\""Visions In Blue\\"", on DVD for the first time is enticing enough!<br /><br />I must admit that I only really discovered Ultravox about 5 or 6 years ago after hearing a handful of their tracks on '80s Internet radio stations and `80s compilations that I`ve added to my own music collection. \\""Vienna\\"", their biggest hit -- #2 in the U.K. for 4 weeks and #1 in Belgium, Ireland, and Holland -- amazingly never charted on the U.S. Hot 100. In Europe and around the world it is often cited as a masterpiece and classic, even ranking #1 on the countdown of the Top 75 songs of  the 1980s by BJMA in 2008.

No matter how many more times \\""Vienna\\"" will be licensed for future collections I will still never tire of it!

Elsewhere, \\""Dancing With Tears In My Eyes\\"", a #3 U.K. smash and massive single throughout Europe in 1984, is probably the band's second most familiar cut after \\""Vienna\\"".

465,5,"During the One Tree Hill show, they play amazing music. I assumed this cd would include a good selection of that music. Very disappointing. Not only for me but for my teenage neice."
466,5,"One of my most favorite Rascal Flatts album out.  The Flatts have been known for choosing the right songs and they didn't disappoint!    Love Who You Love-  Catchy and fun  Here Comes Goodbye- What an amazing song showcasing their vocal talents!  Close- One of my favorite songs on the album.  Forever-  Chilling, beautiful song.  The emotions are so raw.  My favorite Flatts song EVER!  She'd Be California- I'm a Cali girl, the song was fun and Gary seriously rocked out on the vocals!  Unstoppable- Beautiful song about hope and love   Things That Matter- Another song about the \\""things that matter.\\""  Summer Nights- Just a fun song, definitely a great concert song.  Holdin On- I love the images this song paints \\""Like the left behind colors when the sun is gone\\"" to describe a lost love.  Wow.  Once- Another on my favorite songs.  Great intro!    Why- Power ballad.  The song is so beautiful and chilling and breathtaking... WOW  Again my favorite Flatts album!  Definitely recommend it!"
467,2,"This CD mainly consists of very early pieces by Lourie, heavily under the spell of Scriabin & Romanticism. They are very well made, of course, especially if one bears in mind that he was hardly eighteen (!), but in the end they are worth listening solely out of musicological neurosis..."
468,3,"This is Sammy's second album after the storied split from Van Halen.  His first, \\""Marching to Mars,\\"" was driven by his feelings of betrayal, loss, bitterness, and looking forward.  Touring for that album, he assembled the backing band known by this point as the \\""Waboritas\\"" (later, the Wabos), and this is their debut album together.    Clearly in a better mental space, and happy to have the stability of a regular crew again, this album is a lot more upbeat.  A lot of celebration songs, like the made-for-bar-jukebox \\""Mas Tequila,\\"" the overtly named \\""Shag\\"" (no time for subtlety on this one, I guess), \\""The Revival\\"" and the upbeat \\""Red Voodoo.\\""    Mixed in are some good tunes in the classic Hagar style - more artistic than most hard rock, not \\""pop\\"" enough for radio.  These include \\""Sympathy for the Human\\"" (which evokes both the obvious Stones reference and also Sgt. Pepper), \\""Lay Your Hand On Me\\"" / \\""High and Dry Again\\"" (which flow uninterrupted on cd), \\""Right on Right\\"" and \\""Returning of the Wish.\\""    \\""Right on Right\\"" is a rocker recorded live.      \\""Don't Fight It (Feel It)\\"" features the nifty slide guitar of Roy Rogers, a frequent collaborator these days, and the legendary Tower of Power horn section, which gives it a great crossover appeal.  Sammy is always good for songs like this - it won't appeal to his hardcore \\""guitar-only\\"" fans, but it's just good musicianship.    \\""The Love\\"" is a mix of power ballad / up-tempo number and probably would've dominated the airwaves during the hairband era.    This is mostly solid, and probably the right album for him to make at this time, but I do have enough knocks to make it a 3-star:    - Too many \\""borrowed\\"" rhythms.  Blatant Gary Glitter rip-off on \\""Mas Tequila\\"" and \\""Right on Right\\"" is too similar to the classic \\""55.\\""    - The music in \\""Shag\\"" is great but the teenage lyrics make it a guilty pleasure at best - it's cringe-worthy.    So that's 3 out of 11 songs I probably won't listen to, but the rest of the album is pretty good Sammy Hagar music."
469,5,"I happened upon Janelle Monae's video when I was working on something else. This was her video for Many Moons. I loved it! I loved the music, the lyrics, and her very own style. So I started looking her up and looked for other works from her. Every single song I've heard her perform has been extraordinary. She is not just a singer - she provides the whole package - the depth of her lyrics, her beautiful lyrical voice with which she delivers each song, her dance moves. Its a whole experience when you listen to her album. Her message is bold, clear, and truthful.    I very rarely find an artist that I connect with so fully - I would absolutely recommend this album. In the stale environment that has become the music industry, with copycat songs, and old marketing ploys, its difficult to find a refreshing break out of the mold - Janelle Monae is exactly that. I was hooked after one listen, and have become one of her biggest fans! Go Janelle - can't wait for the future suites to come!"
470,5,"The hip-hop heads who follow the genre as closely as high rollers watch a horse race might have other ideas, but for my money D&auml;lek (pronounced \\""DYE-a-leck\\"") was responsible for the best--and most depressing--rap song of 2007. Over 10 minutes in length, the title track from Abandoned Language channeled a world of depravity in the muted wail comprising half of the song's melody, looped and sustained into oblivion. What begins as \\""typical\\"" hip-hop fare sprawls upward and outward as bricks pile atop others and the instruments steadily crush everything beneath them, but not before Okt0pus and D&auml;lek (the MC after whom the duo is named) have their way with words. Amidst their scary, surrealistic street poetry, delivered in a low bark burning with steely resentment, one very direct line stands out: \\""Six-hundred years, ain't a ******* thing different.\\"" And then, just as this thought is allowed to sink in, the raps fragment and dissolve and the music picks up their slack, conveying in sounds what D&auml;lek and Okt0pus cannot express in language.<br /><br />Taking the song's trademark aphorism absolutely literally is missing the point. Of course society has progressed since the Middle Ages, but as for us as human beings, well, the story isn't quite as flattering, is it? We've gathered from historical accounts, art, and literature that the roots of humankind grew from seeds of violence and vilification, neither of which has ever really gone away--only changed form. People still kill people. There's still a palpable discrepancy between the haves and the have-nots. Narcissism powers the engines that drive many of us to our goals. D&auml;lek have treated these judgments as mere observations in their decade-long career, throughout which they appeared to have only become angrier and more focused, as well as more lyrically concrete: who has time for alliteration when someone's just been murdered on the corner of the block? The ingeniousness of the D&auml;lek project, however, lies and may always lie in the overwhelming sheets of sound that throw the two staples of hip-hop (beats and rhymes) into the back seat when they're simply not powerful enough to send the message. Stuffed with noise, mutilated by pedals and after-effects, and layered with instrumental drones both tempered and insane, the music is a poignant retranslation of their worldviews and a hell of a statement in itself--one that describes the gangs of D&auml;lek's home state of New Jersey as much as it does the ugly primordial soup out of which we arose well over 600 years ago.<br /><br />This sort of racket that D&auml;lek deals in has led the lazy among us to label the group as \\""alternative\\"" and stop there, without plumbing the possibilities of what they're ultimately trying to do. By now it's well known that they've toured with Isis, collaborated with Faust, and share more sonic signifiers with the Melvins than Madvillain. They're also experimental in a real sense, fiddling with recording techniques and setting their sights on a different aesthetic each time out; they conceptualized Absence as \\""the book\\"" on extremity, Abandoned Language tried ambience on for size, and so on. Even more than experimentation, however, D&auml;lek have been all about the continual exploration and perfection of a single idea: that even within a decidedly hip-hop framework, music can speak volumes when words feel inadequate. And Gutter Tactics, their fifth album proper, provides perhaps the clearest expression of their intentions yet.<br /><br />Louder, viler, and grittier than its predecessor, Gutter Tactics grew out of recording sessions played by the Deadverse Massive, a shadowy collective of noise artists closely affiliated with the duo. As the musicians whaled on their instruments, Okt0pus and D&auml;lek modified their sounds in real time, ostensibly as a way to excise all the audible humanity from them. Indeed, the backgrounds don't give the impression that they were played by humans,but rather occurred naturally, spewed forth from a hole in the earth or dropped from flying aircraft. After the infamous Reverend Wright gives an incendiary speech condemning Americans' role in terrorism during \\""Blessed Are They Who Bash Your Children's Head Against a Rock\\"", \\""No Question\\"" continues the onslaught with a muck-laden diatribe whose drums stomp threateningly beneath the noise of a thousand melting pianos. The even uglier \\""Armed with Krylon\\"" trades the pianos in for an army of motorcycles splattering Black Sabbath-begotten sludge onto an extraterrestrial hip-hop beat, the way Paik might sound had they been produced by Dan the Automator. El-P is really the only contemporary hip-hop artist working in the same arena, but D&auml;lek deliberately eschew El's swiftness for the \\""heavy\\"" that they seemed to have kept in their crosshairs since Gutter Tactics` inception. Nowhere is this truer than the eight-minute \\""Who Medgar Evers Was...\\"", a trudge through a swamp with concrete boots that dares you to complete it.<br /><br />It's a remarkably exhausting listen from end to end. The raps are stylistically pedestrian and the beats rarely deviate from a leaden 4/4 thud, but this often works in D&auml;lek's favor, since it allows ample latitude for the music to get pushed to front and center. One notable exception to the norm is \\""Los Macheteros / Spear of a Nation\\"", whose beats consist almost entirely of shotgun blasts. From M.I.A.'s \\""Paper Planes\\"" to Terror Danjah's \\""Cock Back V1.2\\"", the purpose of gunshots-as-beats has primarily been to rally and galvanize, but the ones here are uncommonly defeatist. In another context their rhythm could've been reggaeton, but they've been stretched and slowed into un-danceability, and as the track progresses the sad, sad melody continues to engulf them until the music and the shots' echoes become virtually indistinguishable. The verses, too, get bulldozed into the back of the mix, and while it's often difficult to understand them, they're clearly stewing with pent-up rage and seem to be escalating toward something enormous. The duo's alarming poeticism--heard more sharply on Abandoned Language--is missed, but underneath the music's thick substances the tone of D&auml;lek's lyrics (both attitudinal and timbral) makes perfect sense.<br /><br />If this approach sounds suspiciously like shoegaze, it may be vindicating to know that My Bloody Valentine has remained a spiritual influence on the group, and that Loveless is a perennial favorite of D&auml;lek the MC. (In a 2005 interview with Pitchfork he called it \\""one of the most beautiful records I've ever heard\\"".) Strange to imagine that the paths of the transcendently gorgeous MBV and the generally repellant D&auml;lek should cross, though there are moments--\\""We Lost Sight\\"" and \\""A Collection of Miserable Thoughts Laced with Wit\\"" among them--when the line between ugliness and beauty on Gutter Tactics becomes extraordinarily thin. The strongest link between the two acts, however, bypasses the level of sound into the realm of philosophy. If shoegaze is all about surrendering blissfully to the elements, then Gutter Tactics turns this experience right on its head. Okt0pus can barely get through two verses in the closer \\""Atypical Stereotype\\"" before he malfunctions, becoming locked on the phrase \\""Truths stay intangible, they treat us like animals\\"" and then giving way to the music's chloroforming weight. It's a singularly affecting instance in an album full of them, in which D&auml;lek reluctantly, ambivalently, confusedly, and perhaps fearfully submit to forces they know are far greater than themselves.<br /><br />The record's crowning achievement may be how truthfully D&auml;lek convey this ambivalence through music, and in so doing, capture the spirit of a world where tragedy looms overhead, where hate is scarily effective, and where the victim and the victimizer are often the same person. Whether these negative forces attack us from the outside or gripus from within, they're too huge and amorphous to fight against on our own, and D&auml;lek seem to realize it. Another line from \\""Abandoned Language\\"" comes to mind here: \\""I say I'll keep a pen to pad and fingers on triggers / Should I aim it on the temple or several? Can't figure\\"". Gutter Tactics gets D&auml;lek--and maybe us by proxy--no closer to answering this question, for as traumatic as these musical passages are to swallow, it's unclear whether they signify a cocked weapon or a white flag. Yet this fully realized artistic expression of confusion is as deft a statement as we're apt to get from a duo that's been searching for years to discover the tortured voice in their voicelessness.ething enormous.

471,5,"This is a rare recording of one of the greatest songwriters of all time.  The mood at Canterbury House is personal and intimate.  Musically, this is a chance to hear the master early in his career; his guitar sounds fantastic and his voice is clear and crisp.  I'm from the Detroit/Ann Arbor area so it's extra special to me (Neil recalls writing \\""The Old Laughing Lady\\"" on a napkin \\""in true folk tradition\\"" while at the White Tower restaurant in Detroit; he also shares his \\""Detroit experience\\"" in the wee hours after leaving the restaurant).  As other reviews have noted, if you are a long time Neil Young fan, this is a must have.  If you don't know his music, this is a must have so you can be introduced to the musical genius that many have loved for so many years."
472,5,Sweet songs indeed. Everything the Canadian Brass does is class all the way. What more can be said?
473,3,I gave this to my massage therapist for using in her sessions.  Just a little TOO soothing for me.
474,5,"I LOVE this recording and the healing it provides.  This CD has saved me over and over again when life has gotten stressful.  Played through 2 moves and it kept me and everything relaxed, peaceful and flowing with ease and grace - so grateful to have had it!     I now play it for my new puppy when I leave him alone & when he's in his playpen & it soothes him and keeps him chill too.     Have yet to find anyone that doesn't enjoy it and instantly feel better when it is being played, the artists really knew what they were doing when they made this masterpiece of healing :)"
475,5,We have almost all of Justin Robert's CD's and we were very much looking forward to the release of this one!  We weren't disapointed!  It's a great summer CD...way to go Justin!
476,5,"pureNRG's self-titled debut was a great beginning to their music careers, and they show even more promise with their second album \\""Here We Go Again\\"". Here's a track-by-track review:    Here We Go Again: 9/10. Great lyrics, good beat, an overall great start to the album.    Any Which Way: 9/10. Another awesome song. Upbeat, catchy, gets stuck in your head easily.    Like: 6/10. This one's okay. The chorus is kind of catchy, but the verses aren't that good and I find myself skipping this one a lot.    Ain't No Mountain High Enough: 7/10. They do a good job with this remake, but still not an outstanding song.    Call on Jesus: 8/10. Awesome chorus, great message, just doesn't stand out very much.    Girls Can Change the World: 8/10. Good song, a little repetitive, but it's still enjoyable to listen to.    Get Up: 5/10. Not very good. Another song that I skip a lot.    BFF: 9/10. Upbeat, great lyrics, awesome music, everything about this song makes me smile.    Inside Out: 10/10. One of the three standout songs on the album. I don't know what it is about this song that stands above the rest, but it does.    That's What Friends Are For: 10/10. Another standout of the album. The message makes me smile, and I didn't even know this was a remake. It's that good. They do an awesome job with it and it's definitely better than the old version.    Are You Ready: 6/10. Another song I'm not really into. Just not my type of song.    More: 10/10. The last of three standout songs. Matthew West did a wonderful job with this song originally and now pureNRG has remade this song amazingly well and has done better than the original. Definitely one of my favorites on the CD."
477,5,"Here are the most beautiful Bethoveen sonatas, except the No.9. Listening to this Cd is like being transported to a dream world."
478,5,Why doesn't anyone know about this album? Why hasn't this been talked about more than any other album this year? I haven't heard an album like this in years. Just quality music period. I hope he wins an award for this album! Grammy people listen up!!!!!
479,4,"Though it still doesn't beat out Sonic Firestorm as my favorite, this album definitely comes in a close second. The amount of variance and creativity on this one definitely outdoes Inhuman Rampage. This is a must-buy for DragonForce fans, and if you're into vinyl, now's your chance =)    Oh, and the cover art is awesome on the huge LP cover."
480,1,"I can not believe this! Twilight gives off such a great vibe when you read it and now its being thrown away with oh so teen trendy techno. Excuse me I just threw up in my mouth. I do not blame Mrs. Meyer,its usually the soundtrack and executive producer making this decision. Wow guys great job you took a great book and turned it into THE COVEN part 2! These songs distract from the feeling instead of elevating it."
481,5,"The songs on this album are short, experimental, and varied - from thrashing noise music to trip-hoppy electronic - but with a unified, heavily textured production.  ohGr's vocals, for better or for worse, are used more as an instrument than as a communicative device.    As noted elsewhere, on a few songs, the vocals are a little too quiet.  I listened to Devils In My Details with headphones and didn't have any problems hearing them, but on some speakers I did notice the quietness.    There are a lot of great songs on this album, and the production and ideas are top notch.  It's not particularly similar to other ohGr works and I'm glad: ohGr is trying new things rather than resting on tried formulas.  The free verse between songs and the overall organization I felt made the album almost cinematic.  I usually get distracted from whatever else I am doing when I listen.  I hope to see more great albums like this from ohGr in the future too.    Note: I redid my review.  I don't think the last one was very good and apparently other people didn't as well.  Hopefully this is more informative."
482,4,"Released on April 29, 2003, this is a solid retrospective of the textures and avant-garde work from the 1970s, with solid rhythms that keeps the focus on the technological aspects now found in the studio.<br /><br />The 10 numbers - clocking in at 71:01 - were designed for a Japanese/American co-produced documentary, which apparently has never been released. The music stands alone and demonstrates that Edgar Froese does not have to cruise through releasing \\""updated\\"" albums, remixes and live material from the vast TD archives."
483,5,"I happened to here your'e the storm from this cd online, its a great tune so i orderd the cd. I was not disappointed.It has six or seven strong tracks.Communication,Live And Learn,Please Sister and Your'e The Storm are my favorites.Nina Persson has a beautiful voice and the cd is full of simple but catchy guitar hooks.There was also a bonus track, For The Boys, Which is another great song.I have heard other Cardigan records but this one i believe is the best."
484,5,"If I close my eyes while listening to this CD, I can relive the movie, which I loved! I really like Abba anyway but when you hear the music being done by the people in the movie, it comes more alive."
485,5,These guys put out a great album.  The songs are fun and thoughtful.  The music out there.  A great buy.
486,4,"im glad people have touched on this already. uninformed morons slagging a band that was around before a band they like of the same name. anyhow, if you like repulsion i can recommend this. catchy and violent and a bit low fi. the demo came out around the time repulsion was called genocide and they share a similar sound. neither rips the other off however."
487,4,"See my review of the other Homer & Jethro  songs, the mandolin playing is tops, something you don't hear much any more !"
488,5,"The previous reviewer is correct when he states that Cheryl Barker is not very well known outside Australia, the UK and Europe, however one must not overlook her unforgettable performance in Baz Luhrmann's \\""La Boheme\\"" [[ASIN:B000G1ALH0 Giacomo Puccini - La Bohème / Barker, Hobson, Luhrmann (Australian Opera)]] with Opera Australia, which was so popular when staged down under that it led to a DVD being distributed worldwide and a stunningly successful run on Broadway while two other productions were simultaneously being staged.    Cheryl Barker has a beautifully sweet yet strong soprano voice, and here she is most ably accompanied by Richard Bonynge and Orchestra Victoria, the recording sessions taking place in the South Melbourne Town Hall in 2003.  The sound quality is excellent, and is courtesy of Melba Recordings of Melbourne.    All of Puccini's operas are covered, from his first \\""Le Villi\\"" (1884) to \\""Turandot\\"" (1926).  Each one makes you wish for a full recording of each opera with Cheryl Barker in the lead.  For those wanting to seek out more, I strongly recommend Opera Australia's CD release of Dvorak's \\""Rusalka\\"" [[ASIN:B000ZBPPX6 Dvorák: Rusalka]].    Enjoy a most beautiful, if relatively unknown, voice."
489,5,"I love to listen to Brendan Croker. Mark Knopfler must agree he hung around with him too. This English country gentleman knows how to write and play and should always remain proud of this band. A must for people to listen to the whole cd before passing judgement. A true collectable. Thanks Amazon for having these ready to purchase. No Money At All, You Don't Need Me Here, My Government and Mister must be listened to... so place this on the list!! Charlie"
490,5,"This cd is unbelievable and deserves all the kudos and awards it has received.  Carrie Underwood's first cd was a powerhouse seller and also garnered her critical acclaim and tons of awards.  But as with any artist it is the second release that showcases their creativity and true talent.<br /><br />This cd far surpasses the first, which I loved, in song selection, vocal performance and interpretation and Carrie proves herself a true unique talent with her own special gifts.<br /><br />I can put this cd in my player and let it run over and over for there is no filler here for me.  But there are certainly some highlights.  ALL AMERICAN GIRL allows Carrie to hit some notes never heard before.  Her interpretation of I TOLD YOU SO is heartfelt and very much her own.  But it is the standout I KNOW YOU WON'T a weepy ballad that Carrie turns into raw emotion that will stun you.  She holds notes forever and puts all her range and capabilities into it.  I find this song as much a classic as Linda Ronstadt doing DESPERADO.  Of course the uptempo FLAT ON THE FLOOR and LAST NAME are awesome.<br /><br />I am thrilled with how openly Carrie Underwood has been accapted into the country music community for she is what the genre stands for.  A true country girl with talent, charm and unique gifts with a very honest, positive message.  Her career is laid out for her.  She is one of the rare finds of this decade.<br /><br />Carrie Underwood rules."
491,4,An enjoyable soundtrack to the musical 1776.  This CD would make an excellent addition to your film soundtrack collection.
492,5,"Dwayne Britton is going to command audiences to stand up and take notice!  I have already written a review that will appear in the August issue of Savvy Women Magazine, but here on Amazon I must say a few more words on Dwayne's behalf!    This man is engaging to listen too...words from the songs will be driven into your heart to stay forever.  Enjoy the sensation Dwayne will leave you with...long after the last song is sung.  I have found in Dwayne an artist who not only sings the words, he is spelling out for you a story with each track.  The work that has gone into this cd is a masterpiece all on it's own.    I adore this man's vocal artistry so much, the CD is with me every day.  If you want to feel happy for hours on end, purchase this CD.  Dwayne has made a mark on the world, and his debut is one of the finest works I have listened too.  His vocals are entrancing, engaging and to live with complete honesty I must say here and now, Dwayne Britton is going to rise and reach the pinnacle of success..!    To Dwayne on a personal note, thank you for the joy this CD brings me daily!!!  There is so much happiness permiating from this disc, I can only urge the buying public with my words and hope they find the beauty that lives within you and welcome all of your talent into their home as well as their hearts.    Love to you,  Mo  xoxoxo"
493,5,"I recently revisited this and the the follow-up after not having listened to them for a few years, and although I know I originally bought them for all the guest guitarists, I was blown away all over again by the astounding writing and playing of the core group of Kelly Keeling, Carmine Appice and Tony Franklin. I love really hot bass sounds and Franklin's fretless literally growls on most of these tracks, plus his patterns and fills are very, very creative. I know he's been a number of other albums, but I can't recall him ever showing his stuff the way he has on these two albums, especially this first one.    But there's more...... Keeling's writing and singing here is absolutely first-rate. Doug Pinnick does an excellent vocal on one track, and the rest are all Kelly. And yet he manages to sound like two or maybe three different singers throughout the course of the album. Once again, I think his performance (and writing) here is a cut above just about anything else he's done.    And then of course there's Carmine..... Guitar Zeus? How about Drum Zeus!  What else can you say, he's easily one of the top rock drummers ever, living or dead. Plus he's been heavily into writing and production for the last 20 years or so, and doing an excellent job at that as well. Not exactly sure why he put his name out front on this project, but I guess he's earned the right to a little vanity.    And last but not least there are the guest guitarists, which would probaly be the main selling point for most buyers (as it was for me) until you get into it. My personal favorites were Paul Gilbert and Doug Aldrich for sheer creativeness and technical flair. Steve Morse's tone is unmistakeable, but I though his solo could have been just a little hotter.  The rest of the soloists were just fine, but the performance of the core group jumped out at me much more than they did.    It's too bad they didn't carry this project on with a permanent guitarist.  The quality level here is very high. Getyourself a copy, you won't be disappointed."
494,5,"This is a classic Blues album put together by Document Records. Both versions of \\""Kassie Jones\\"" and \\""John Henry\\"" are excellent, \\""I Will Turn Your Money Green\\"" is humorous and features some of Furry's best guitar playing, and \\""Falling Down Blues\\"" is a personal favorite. It's easy to see why the great Dave Van Ronk covered \\""Dry Land Blues\\"". If you've only heard post-World War II Furry Lewis recordings, you really need to pick this up. His guitar playing was immaculate in the 20s, his singing gentler on the ears, and his lyrics were, well, the kind that only Furry could produce. This is one of the best releases in the entire Document Records catalogue. I highly recommend everyone buying this, or even downloading it off of Amazon.com. It is most definitely worth it. When I hear the lyrics, \\""I wished I had a-died, mama, when I were young. I would not a-had this low-down race to run\\"", I get the chills!"
495,4,"What can you say about Boyce and Hart other than the men could write a pop song. Sure, just like Mark Lindsay with the Raiders, they were copping Beatle licks and ideas, but who the hell wasn't? And before anyone compares them to the pop 'icons' of today, watch them on Bewitched AND I Dream of Jeannie. They definitely knew who they were and could give a knowing wink to the audience. Filled with great hooks, great singing, and a couple of 'why wasn't this song on the top of the charts instead of...' moments. Ignore the cheesy Vegas style photo and get inside the grooves, man ; - )"
496,5,"So unlike the other reviewer, I found Jenni's music to be very moving and beautiful.  I was lucky enough to have stumbled upon her at one of my favorite local spots that I typically run from when there are bands.  Instead, as I was grabbing my first drink of the night I heard this sweet voice that coaxed me to the 'stage' side of the house and I was stuck!  I could only pry myself away for a refill and even that was hard.  I bought 2 of her CDs on the spot (Pieces and No Second Guesses) and had the pleasure of speaking with Jenni after her performance.  She's bright, down to earth and is extremely talented at piano, guitar and vocals.  Her voice is extremely sexy with a seductively breathy and crisp style.  I've already listened to these albums twice through each and I've owned them for less than 24 hours!  Do yourselves a favor and give Jenni a listen."
497,3,"I like Veggie Tales and I like Christian Hit Music, so I figured this would be fun.  Some of the songs work really well, especially when the original artist is singing along.  The way this CD fails is the quality of the instrumental tracks.  They are too good!  It makes the Veggies sound like bad karaoke."
498,5,"this album was released in two separate versions - one at the beginning of the year as a cd only, then one in the fall after one or more concerts that morrison did 'live at the ryman' in nashville.  reason?  the later version includes a second disk - a dvd of five of the songs done at the ryman.    he covers webb pierce, hank williams, curly williams, leon payne, and rodney crowell, among others - fifteen tracks.  wow!  and he owns 'there stands the glass - he' turned the pierce song from a radio lament into a real scenario...    i only hope that morrison will release a full album of the live ryman recordings, since the studio stuff (while good) seems stiff and almost lifeless compared to his work live... it just does not hold a candle to the cuts from nashville.    if you are gonna buy this album, then i recommend that you spend the few extra bucks and buy the second version.    a side note - i discovered the 'live at the ryman' material via youtube... there were three videos put up earlier in 2008.  i thought then, 'wow, what a clever guy morrison is - putting up a few cuts to get people to buy the album.'  i mean, that is what mtv is all about, right?  but having the cuts on demand seemed like such a great marketing idea.      i bought the album right away [luckily reading carefully to find the 'plus-dvd' version]. i sent the links to friends, who then bought the album.  i got people interested who hadn't listened to the man in years, and he sold a few albums through my viewing that video.    but it turns out that he is not as clever as i had given him credit for being.  one night, intending to show the youtube video to a friend, i found a notice that morrison and exile music had put a halt to the playing of the videos - and so cut off a potential source of audience enhancement.  i said, 'fooey.'  i wrote him a letter about it but he's apparently too shy to answer.    but it's still a damn good album!"
499,1,"It is like REM trying to cover themselves and doing a bad job.  Michael Stipe's lyrics are horrible.  He should go back to singing unintelligibly, and they should quit trying so hard.  Maybe, they should quit before it gets any worse.  Think Bill Berry!"
500,5,"This is a great CD from singer-songwriter Booke White of American Idol fame. This was released by an independent record label before Brooke went on AI. She cowrote all of the songs, with the exception of 2 covers Yellow and Dream On. Yellow is exceptionally well done. THis CD is amazing and so much better than so much of the crap today. Brooke has something to say and hopefully she will get the record deal she deserves. She is a true artist, not only does she sing, but she writes and play instruments. Overall, highly recommended-you can also download it on Itunes..."
501,1,"I REALLY wish I had read the comments before purchasing.     Having been a fan since \\""Fallen\\"", I thought that maybe  I would enjoy another great album. I love Amy Lee's   voice...Well this one was \\""the WORST music I have ever  heard.\\""    The loud \\""Metalica like music\\"" is all you hear. You can not  hear a word of what Amy Lee is saying in her lyrics.     Every single song is just awful.     I am SO disappointed."
502,3,"Let the record show that this album could possibly be slowly turning guilty pleasure purely because hip hop isn't as blatant in this album for my taste.  I realize of course that hip hop and funk go hand in hand naturally, but R & B?  A lot of these tracks have a touch of trilly vocals that I don't care for.  Sometime tri-fusions aren't a good thing.  It also has a gnarls barkley feel in some places.  Guilty pleasures make me uncomfortable in heavy rotation.  But I am giving this one a pain-staking while to set in and get cozy.  I like it, but I don't love it."
503,4,"Live at Murat is excellent.  UM all is about the live experience & these discs capture it well.  If you're a fan you either already have it, or won't get it b/c you have all the downloads.  I have all the downloads & I still bought this.  I am happy w/ the purchase.      If you're not yet a fan, UM is difficult to describe...rock, jazz, blues, fusion, prog rock, modern rock, post-modern rock, jam band...to scratch the surface.  Do not expect much like Phish or Widespread Panic.  UM is less singer-songwriter oriented, less arena rock-y, less classic rock-y than them.  I think UM has more depth & breadth.  I also think there is no UM w/out Phish & WS.  Murat is an accurate snapshot of UM's style, virtuosity, & variety.  If you like some/all of Murat, you'll find more in their catalog that appeals to you.  If you don't like any of it, move along.  This set is a good start for newbies.      I gave it 4/5 stars, b/c I have all their downloads.  After having 50+ hours of their music, & hearing these 2 discs...some small part of me can't help but say, \\""Yeah, that's good but...\\"""
504,5,"Wow, this is one powerful rock album.  It pack a serious MEAN and NASTY punch.  It's raw, straight forward, simple rock and roll with the volume turned WAY up.  But wait!  That's not all!  The band members also give us some highly enjoyable guitar soloing in the title song.  This band was truly at their very best in the early days.      Pick it up today and hear how AC/DC used to sound a long time ago when rock and roll was all about innovation and power.  Why didn't hard rock bands hold back in the early days?  Because it would have been boring to do so.  AC/DC knew that's not the direction they wanted to take their music.  They didn't want to be the first band to hold back their amazing talent.      When albums this good are released, you just don't know what to DO with yourself.  You can't believe the speakers in your home haven't rocked all the way across the living room and into the coffee table, knocking off flowers and coffee cups.  A guitar sound SO LOUD it almost cracks the speakers in half and leaves you begging for more, despite the damage you know the guitar playing will cause to your stereo system.    But you know what?  We keep coming back to it.  We keep coming back to the music and we make it the greatest music we've ever heard in our lives."
505,3,"This is a decent little pop record, but that's all it is. Airy, sunny, afro-pop tinged melodies about nothing much at all.     Remember Haircut 100? Yeah, this is them, just a younger incarnation. Heck, they even LOOK like Haircut 100, sweaters and all.     The Strokes? Are you kidding me? This is nowhere close to the Strokes. Not even in the same universe. Some of the Paul Simon comparisons are apt, if you go back to Graceland or Rhythm of the Saints. But if you really want a parallel, all you have to do is dust off that old Haircut 100 record.      It's a shame, that people are going to be slagging this band a year from now. They neither deserve inordinate praise nor ridicule. This is simply an innocuous pop record to put on in the background while sunning in the backyard on a spring Sunday, gin and tonic close at hand."
506,5,"I love the music on this cd, just wish the movie itself had been a little bit better."
507,5,"I am amazed that this release has not been reviewed by anyone to date. I bought it along with my first sacd player in '04. It is one of the best examples of what 5.1 can do for the listening experience. IE total emersion in sound. Great mixing and mastering. If the group should re-release all of their previous cd's on 5.1 I would without a doubt replace them all.  It will sell you on sacd for sure. Also gives \\""Dark side of the moon\\"" a run for it's 'money'."
508,5,"If you loved it when it was new, you will love it now! The quality of sound is great and I'm delighted to have access to it again. I literally wore out the original album when I was in college. It helped me to reduce the stress in my life and I imagine it will continue to do the same for me now...40 years later!"
509,3,"About half of the tracks are good, the rest sound the same. Tries to be a rapper or something. She has a great voice and should concentrate on her material more. The album doesn't have an identity Is it Rock, Rap, Club? What?"
510,5,Anything from Rammstein is always quality. You can't expect anything less from them. Vokerball is no different. Awesome.
511,5,Josh Groban has a an amazing gift - his voice. And Christmas songs are even better when he signs them. A definite addition to everyone's Christmas CDs.
512,5,"I am the proud owner of at least thirty Christmas CD's.  This compilation is the best collection of quality music performed superbly that I have ever heard.  I had to drive 1400 miles by myself before Christmas and I never tired of listening to this wonderful music.  I also ordered several more copies of \\""#1 Christmas Album\\"" to gift to family and friends who enjoy quality music."
513,5,"This is truly an album experience, not just a bunch of songs.  Each song has pieces of other songs, whether it be a few measures of bells or a familiar stanza of melody.  Though each song is also unique enough to skip around to favorite songs on a short drive, the best listen is all the way through the album.    References to Flaming Lips and Neutral Milk Hotel are justified.  The level of cohesion between songs and instrumental diversity is comparable to NMH's \\""In the Aeroplane Over the Sea,\\"" while the relentlessly catchy (and high pitched) vocal melodies remind me of later Flaming Lips.  Despite the references, Cloud Cult is not at all derivative and it's difficult to name a \\""sounds like\\"" band.    Any album that appeals to both me and my girlfriend is easy to recommend because she has very different tastes than I do.  An excellent album from start to finish.  It is refreshing to find such a high level of production from an indie label."
514,5,"It's a lovely collection of poignant, rich, gorgeously atmospheric, spirited pieces, performed with elegance, dash, and precise passion.  (Sigh) - just look at the price for USED!  Why these performances by Arthur Moreira Lima have dropped off the face of the planet, for years now already, one can only guess.  Probably tied up in some squabble ...    In the meantime, other performers have stepped in - e.g., Joshua Rifkin, and why not, it's the Scott Joplin story all over again (and, by the way, may I say, *thank you* for Scott Joplin, Mr Rifkin.)  Anyway, I say it's the Rifkin/Joplin story again because the music's beautiful, it's in the public domain, it's barely known any more, and no doubt Mr. Rifkin provides a sensitive, sympathetic rendition; but, I haven't heard the Rifkin performances of Nazareth's music.  I can only assure you that *this* disk, performed by Lima, is charming and delightful.    The LP came out in the 80s.  Heard it when the local classical music station started giving it air time.  I own a second Nazareth/Moreira tangos and waltzes LP, the one with the cover illustration of the lady demurely shading her face with the peacock feather.  And I'm writing this review because, y'know what? - I'm finally putting together the technology to archive my LP recordings to a CD for my personal use - it has been too long, *far* too long since I have basked in this music - and I just finished about 40 minutes or so of scrounging around on the web to satisfy my curiousity as to whether it had, yet, wandered back into any kind of non-exorbitant availabilty.  It hasn't, and that's a pity.  (And my other LP, with the peacock lady on the cover, I find no certain evidence that *that's* available in *any* form.) So ... enjoy the previews.  Archive the LP, if you have one!"
515,5,"This CD was a gift for my daughter, and she LOVED it.  Better than she expected.  I did notice it was cheaper at Target this week, though.  Oh well."
516,4,"This is an excellent collection. It's missing 'I, Zimbra', 'The Big Country' and although it wasn't released as a single, I wish it had 'Drugs' on it, but it has all the other hits. This is a great collection for most Talking Heads fans."
517,5,I bought this CD for the holiday season and I absolutely love it! It's one of the best Christmas CDs out there right now. All of my roommates love it too! I'd highly recommend anyone buying this CD for the Christmas-lover in their life!
518,5,"It took a while for me to open this c.d.  Finally, after popping it into my car and listening to the whole c.d. I was amazed!!!  You can truly hear the talent of Jordin.  The songs vary from straight pop to r&b and a little country.  I thought it was a wide range c.d. that hits all listeners.  I love it and haven't been able to stop listening to it.  I feel that some of the songs have an 80's/90's feel to it which was refreshing to this 28 year old.  Just put it this way, if this c.d. was to get scratched I would buy another one.  Way to go Jordin!!! Hopefully, on her next c.d. she will sing some old school songs like on American Idol!  I would love her to remake some classics since she is a true talent!!!  Buy the c.d. people...this c.d. is refreshing and so better that Alicia Keyes' c.d."
519,4,"This is a great song. The melody, the songwriting, the vocal runs and the video also. Very cute, charming and very uplifting.<br /><br />Mariah shrieks a bit on this tune but we've all come to get used to her style of singing.

521,5,"There are times when I despair of today's \\""street\\"" music: the lack of compositional ability and musicianship, the appalling drone that passes for \\""singing\\"" and the atrocious lyrics, etc., etc. At such times I thank Prajnaparamita (Mother of the Buddhas) for classical music and jazz.<br /><br />Then chance mousing around leads you to something new. Somewhere at some small hour of the morning I was following some \\""if you like Joe Satriani you'll like...\\"" link and I e-stumbled upon Ned Evett. He's not like Satch to my way of thinking, but thank you Prajnaparamita! Oh yeah!

522,5,not a bad song on the cd....buy it if you truly love him! you won't be disappointed!
523,5,"Ian could have never made this album with Mott, it is way too personal an effort. Not a single weak track on the whole blessed thing. \\""Once Bitten , Twice Shy\\"" , \\""Boy\\"" , \\""The Truth....\\"" , it just gets better with each listen. A much under-appreciated album. Do yourself a favor , click the \\""Add to shopping cart\\"" button"
524,4,"Because the Verdi Requiem has been gloriously recorded by a number of great condcutors (Giulini, Karajan, Fricsay, Reiner, De Sabata, and Toscanini come to mind), Barenbloim is bound to fall a bit short. He has a trump card, however, in the Chicago Sym. and its world-class chorus, who perform amazingly here.  Thanks to the clear, dynamic sound quality, every aspect can be heard perfectly. The large forces for the Verdi Requiem are a devil to balance, but the engineers have done as well as on any version I've ever heard.<br /><br />Among the soloists, Domingo and Meier do best -- they are among the most satisfying to be heard on modern recordings. Furlanetto is consistently too loud and emotionally flat; Marc has a gorgeous voice but not much temperament, so she can't fully carry off the soul drama of the concluding Libera Me -- in fact, she loses steam as this taxing section proceeds. Yet with the CSO and chorus at full force behind her, it almost doesn't matter. The earth opens up in a thrilling way. I wish Barenboim had more to say, but at the very least he marshals his immense musical forces with total professionalism. Highly recommended to fans of the orchestra and chorus."
525,5,I love every song on this album!  The lyrics and melodies are addicting.  These guys are so talented.  I can't wait for their next album!
526,5,"I'm ashamed to admit that I remained unaware of BRMC until earlier this year. Even more embarrassing is that someone in the UK turned me on to them! That's because they're bigger in Europe than they are here, even though they're a California-based band. (They're on the road so much that it hardly matters where they \\""live\\"", though.)    Comparisons to T-Rex and Jesus and Mary Chain, with maybe a little Stone Roses thrown in, are valid. The band is fantastic live-- if they're coming your way, make it a point to go. I don't understand why they seem to have very little traction in the US. If the song \\""Berlin\\"" doesn't hook you, try \\""Spread Your Love\\"" from BRMC or \\""Ain't No Easy Way\\"" from Howl. If you like guitars, you should love this band."
527,5,"I first heard Amber Digby on XM13 (Willie's Place - formerly Hank's Place) on satellite radio, and was immediately taken by her Texas honky-tonk inspired voice.  This release has some her very best stuff, including \\""I'm Ashamed Of You\\"", an XM13 staple.  For those of you who haven't heard her, and like traditional music, you're in for a treat."
528,5,"Chalk me up as another casual Billy Idol fan until I started to listen to CYBERPUNK. As a whole, the many and varied pieces here may *not* grab you on the first or even the second listening. But eventually you come to recognize the genius and pure entertainment of one track after another, culminating in the rapturous juggernaut of MOTHER DAWN. Put it on, let it run from beginning to end a few times, and you'll be hooked for life...and regrettably sad that this album was not recognized for the Magnum Opus that it was, for Idol's unique musical career."
529,5,"Simply wonderful - song structure, vocals, musicianship and production. I heard they broke up but hope that Caithlin De Marrais will stay close to a microphone."
530,5,this album is a collection of tiamat's best song for those of u who have itunes can create this album with your play list's for those of u who don't u should buy this cd.
531,5,"I was thrilled when I saw this series of lullabye CDS - however a lot of them sound like horror-movie music.  Sometimes the hard stuff does not translate well into an innocent sound.  This was by far the best we've heard.  Not only do the melodies work with baby-friendly instruments, the arrangements themselves are complex enough to hold mom and dad's interest too.  A few of the other CDs in the series are a little plunky and repetitive, but not this.  It's made me appreciate Zep more for their skill in crafting a layered song.    It's become a favorite in our house.  Highly Recommended!"
532,5,I was never a huge Creed fan when they came out I always heard Higher on the radio and thought nothing of it really and one day I decided to give this album a chance and I'm glad I did because this is probably there best disc.  Weathered was really generic typical mainstream rock it wasn't bad and it wasn't great.  I don't understand why CREED gets bashed all the time they are  a decent band Alice in Chains and Pearl Jam always comes to mind when I listen to them.  There is not one bad song on this disc which is why I give it 5 stars.  All these songs are really great and nothing seems like filler at all except maybe Wash Away Those Years but other than that every song is great.  Don't judge it by there singles sit down and listen to this album.  I suggest you start with this album then My Own Prison and then Weathered.

534,5,"I love this album. I mainly bought it because of the song \\""Password (Live)\\"" because it's like a hip-hop-praise & worship song. I wish I didn't buy this album so late, but it was worth the buy. The only song I'm not crazy about is \\""Doin it Big\\"". I love the music, but it has too much rapper's vanity in it for me. If I wanted to hear that I would've bought a secular rapper's album. What I want to hear is a rapper boast about God. So I unfortunately skip this track. It's unfortunate because I really like the track but the lyrics is not edifying for me. Other than that, it's a cool album. I will more than likely be buying his new album  [[ASIN:B000UZ4EU2 Kingdom Business]] in September. I just hope it's not loaded with rapper's vanity."
535,5,"A solid release of 80s Hard Rock/Pop Metal songs that makes you wonder why this group wasn't more well-known.  Solid vocals, musicianship, and songs ranging from Ballads to Hard Rockers (mostly Hard Rockers).  This is a must-have for any 80s Rock fan."
536,5,This album as well as this artist seems to get some unfair negativity but I'm not buying into that for a minute.  As time goes on Garth Brooks and his songs and singing style continue to capture the hearts of many including myself.  People accuse him of dragging it out into the pop arena or some such but if you really look at the songs and the man who sings them they embrace old country styles extremely well.  Another masterpiece from Garth Brooks and I continue to never tire from the songs that are found here.
537,5,"A fabulous voice...reminds me of Enya, yet  much more spiritual and soothing. I play this  album to become calm and centered when I am painting."
538,4,I initially bought this CD for 3 songs but after buying the CD I couldn't get enough of BIG 10-4's music. I think the band has a lot of potential-and this CD proves it. This is definitely a CD you can just put in the CD player and listen straight threw without wanting to skip all the crappy songs.

540,2,"Manuel Rosenthal arranged this frothy ballet score from Offenbach melodies both familiar and obscure, so presumably this recording would be a definitive interpretation.  Unfortunately, of the three recordings he made of Gaite, this one's just not competitive.  Perhaps because he was in his mid-90s when he made this third recording, the performance is just so s-l-o-w, it no longer seems like a ballet, but rather a \\""tonal picture.\\""  Rosenthal's recording in the mid-1950s with the Berlin RIAS orchestra for Remington, and a later recording (late 1970s) for EMI (with the same orchestra as this Naxos CD, coincidentally) are just so much more effective.      One should give fair dues to Monsieur Rosenthal just for making the effort to wax this recording in his tenth decade ... but you can do better with his earlier renditions, as well as a number of other conductors who have made equally fine recordings of the complete Offenbach/Rosenthal score.  Seek out Eugene Ormandy, Arthur Fiedler, Anatole Fistoulari, and even Georg Solti as useful alternatives.    A similar situation exists with the selections from \\""Offenbachiana\\"" that serve as a filler on the Naxos CD.  Rosenthal created this pastiche on a commission from Remington Records back in the mid-1950s ... and he recorded the complete score twice (first in Berlin at the time of its composition ... later on in France in the 1970s).  Here, we we are given only about one-quarter of the score, and again it's played too slowly.  Rosenthal's French full-score performance is available on an Ades CD."
541,2,"For the past 10 years or so, the Queens have consistently released some of the best rock music to be found anywhere.  Though invariably loud and abrasive, their songs ranged from the eerie and ominous to tightly structured pop classics that were never derivative.  Coupled with decent lyrics and great musicianship, they stood distinctly apart from and far above their peers.  Unfortunately, none of this is evident on the new release.  The songs meander and are reminiscent, to me at least, of a style personified by the Greatful Dead...much harder, of course, but just as uninspiring.   Sick, sick, sick a supposed standout here, reminds me of another clunker of theirs, the repetitive and just plain stupid song, Feelgood Hit of the Summer (an anthem for brain dead meatheads).  Every good band delivers a clunker on occasion and they have risen (or stumbled?) to the occasion on this CD.  P.S.  After repeated listenings, it gets much worse."
542,5,"i went to see the reunited team dresch play this week and even after more than ten years, the songs are still relevant, blisteringly spot-on, and brought tears to my eyes. the ladies in team dresch have an amazing and unique thing going with this band and their reunion couldn't have come at a better time.   <br />  <br />their unique voices, intricate guitar strains, and political and emotional lyrics underpin the overarching themes of self acceptance, love, queer positivity, inner strength, passionate politics, and the search for role models for gay and questioning youth.   <br />  <br />woven together tightly and lovingly, this record is your blanket of protection; warm, comforting and assuring when you can find no other solace in this homophobic culture."
543,4,"You want some whipped cream with that, she said as I waited with mounting anticipation.  Yes, yes and I also got this album.  You gotta love those Mocha Frappucinos at Starbucks.<br /><br />As I listen to this, several things really impress me.  As he is getting older his lyrics are getting so much deeper and emotional. I particularly like Ever Present Past with its contrasting title.  But this is one of his most interesting songs, because the lyrics are musically contrasted with a driving straight eight style riff with a musical countermelody, and also gives his voice a chance to shine.  This is a great song.<br /><br />Mr Bellamy is also one of his vivid word portraits, where his songs have characters somewhat like he did in Maxwell's Silver Hammer, or Lovely Rita.  Vintage Clothes is also rather intriguing.<br /><br />There is nothing here that screams number one. All the songs are listenable, I mean there are no bad songs that make my finger reach for the skip button.  Probably the weakest song is the catchiest one Dance Tonight.  Its a little simplistic but keeps running around my head.<br /><br />I am so impressed by this album I just went out and got Chaos and Creation his last album. That is a great album, and I particularly love A Certain Softness, one of his best songs ever, with a soft romantic latin jazz style.  Really cool.  Macca still has it, as much as ever, and now with extra punch to his lyrics.<br /><br />I hope you find this review helpful."
544,4,"While not quite as compelling overall as The Red Thread, Over The Hills is a solid album. As others have said, there are too many cover songs here, and while Lucy never fails to find the value in any song, she could easily have skipped a couple of these. It's her original songs that make this an album to cherish. In particular, the two songs inspired by her father's death (especially the title track) and The Gift, about how her musical gift runs directly back to her grandfather, are beautifully crafted and overwhelmingly moving. (I can't listen to them without fighting back tears.) Amelia is also excellent. These songs are just as good as anything on her earlier records... and that's pretty darn good!"
545,3,"By 1980, Kiss were in turmoil. Peter Criss was gone (Anton Fig plays all drums on the album) and Ace Frehley wasn't too far behind as he was getting disgruntled with the band's new music direction coupled with the loss of Peter. After Dynasty did not merit the success Kiss had wanted and that it was starting to tear apart the Kiss Army, they tried to create an album that everybody - especially radio - would want to hear. Not everyone felt their sentiments in the USA but in Europe - especially Australia - Unmasked was one of Kiss' biggest sellers and they played overseas to some of their largest crowds ever. The only positives that came from this CD in the United States was their children fan base grew considerably, Shandi was a minor hit, and it was certified Gold by the RIAA two months after its release.    Kiss' Unmasked ranks up there with the Elder, Crazy Nights, Hot in the Shade, and Carnival of Souls as their most maligned, hated and weakest releases to date. If you want old school hard rockin' Kiss, you won't find it here and the ones that do rock are so lifeless and sterile due to Vini Poncia's squeaky clean production, keys/synths and co-writing input on most of the songs that it should have been named MASKED. Read on for my review of each song from the Unmasked album (from 1 to 10):    1. Is That You?: Probably the only song on Unmasked that shows any type of hard rock grit. Paul's ode to easy girls...\\""you always get the boys you like, play nice then stick them with your knife...\\"" An enjoyable Kiss tune NOT WRITTEN BY THEM (Gerard McMahon)!?! I give it an 8.    2. Shandi: This was the first single off the record - only a top 60 hit (#56) here but outside the US it was a smash. Infectious groove by Anton and nice guitar work by Paul and Ace. Vocals by Paul are top notch and the backing vocals sound wonderful. The bass on this song was played by a session man named Tom Harper (no relation) - why I'm not sure. Probably Vini's idea. One of my favorites of theCD. A 10.    3. Talk to Me: Ace's 1st of three songs and this was the second single. Next to Firehouse, the most words ending in \\""-tion\\"" in a Kiss song. Great rocker. To me, Anton Fig is the star of this track. 9/10.    4. Naked City: My absolute favorite song from Unmasked. Gene does an outstanding job on this one and the chorus alone won me over. Very dark and very Gene. Spectacular song - one of his best. 10 all the way.    5. What Makes the World Go Round: Now here's where the album goes awry. Forgettable Kiss song by Paul about love making the world...well, you get it. The riffs and the chorus doesn't do anything for me. Yawn. A bore. A measly 2 points.    6. Tomorrow: How this wasn't a hit and like another reviewer stated about why this Paul song wasn't in an 80s movie soundtrack baffles me. A true underrated pop gem. Good job Paul! I give it a 8.    7. Two Sides of the Coin: A laugher by Ace. Wow, what masterpiece lyrics: \\""I've met some ladies, I've met some girls, but they don't tell you, they just wanna whirl. It's kinda funny, a little sad, but they're not happy, they're just kinda glad\\"". How can Ace sing all of that with a serious demeanor? I've heard more controversial lyrics from Romper Room! A funny number but nothing else. I only give it a big fat 3 only for Anton Fig's drum solo in the middle of the song. In my opinion, they hired the right guy to drum on this record (Dynasty as well).    8. She's so European: Gene's ode to \\""one of a kind\\"" European girls. A clunker. The synthesizers are so cheesy it's unreal and they just don't belong. Damn you, Vini! Bubblegum at its most sugarless taste and to me the worst song along with What Makes... on Unmasked. Poppy synth keyboards and Gene's vocals just don't gel...BLECH! ZERO out of 10.    9. Easy as it Seems: Another cheeseball but this one I'll eat and risk a cavity. The keyboards work here for some reason. I like the groove with the percussion in the background. Not Paul's best but the pulsing backbeat and backing vocals save it from a flush down the toilet. A 6.    10. Torpedo Girl: Ace's 3rd song and it makes up for 2 Sides...big time. I love the line before Ace's solo: \\""C'mon get your feet wet\\""! A laidback fun number that some say sounds Beach Boys-ish. All Kiss members and Fig shine on this one and sounds like they're havin' a blast despite everything that was going on in their camp. Another gem on Unmasked. Nine.    11. You're All That I Want: A Gene song that closes the album out on an OK note. Nothing special. Nice harmonies on the chorus though. So-so. Gimme five.    Overall, you need to have an open mind to fully appreciate Unmasked. If you're expecting this to be a \\""KISS\\"" record - as some would say, enjoying it after one listen - you'll be very upset. Took me a while to get into. I do like it and listen to it from time to time but I wouldn't spend more than $6-7 on it. You could find Unmasked used on Amazon or eBay like I did - found mine on Amazon new for a buck sixty! There are much better Kiss albums to choose from like: Kiss, Alive!, Destroyer, Creatures of the Night, Revenge, and even Dynasty. If you're new to Kiss and/or want to purchase all of their albums, leave Unmasked towards the last ones that you'd buy. Not even the band members care much for this album. Gene Simmons had once said when asked about Unmasked that \\""Kiss were going through a lot of changes, but sometimes it's OK to take a few wrong turns so when we get back on track we know why it feels so good to come home.\\""     Unmasked is an average pop rock album - not a classic, but not completely horrible. For the open minded, fans of lite rock and/or Kiss completists only. 3 stars."
546,5,"I have always \\""liked\\"" DSB. I love a big voice. When \\""Histroy Repeating\\"" came out, I loved hearing her in a contemporary song- and that video!  Just great!  This song deserves  a lot of attention- the song itself is just THAT good. OMG! She cracks a sound barrier or two- at 70 years old! I am in absolute awe of her vocal abilities. There is NO singer near her age or even half her age that sounds this spectacular. Check out her live performance on YouTube and you will sit there with your mouth dropped open to the ground.  'Never The Bride' has written an excellent song with great lyrics and a sound that is a perfect match for DSM. This should have been the theme to 'Casino Royale' instead of their wimpy, forgettable choice. Radio stations in America will never pick it up-they stink, but if you like old school pop music and appreciate amazing vocals- get a copy."

549,5,"Well done to all involved in the release of this CD. My 25 years search for the mysterious and magical music of 'Lost in Space' has now been rewarded. Hundreds of letters sent by fans of this music over the years has paid off with a beautifully presented double CD package containing extensive liner notes about the music & composers involved. Great artwork from Mark Banning which we have come to expect and crystal clear remastering of the soundtrack elements.  One piece of cue music remains elusive however. It was first heard during the episode 'The reluctant stowaway' and used extensively in the first season. The cue commences with the sound of a heartbeat coupled with trombones played in their lowest register. The 40th Anniversary liner notes state that some elements of 'The Reluctant Stowaway' soundtrack were lost, I guess this important cue was one of them? Possibly copies of the original soundtrack exist in other parts of the world. I live in Hope. Bernard Hermanns music does not appear in any of the Lost in Space releases. Could this be that copyright is held elsewhere?  The Hermann music is very important. Music fans may not be aware that John Robinson's jet pack scene for example uses music from the 1953 film \\"" beyond the 12 mile reef \\"". Other dark and sinister scenes from 'Lost in Space' use the Hermann music from the films \\""The day the earth stood still\\"" 1951 and \\""Garden of Evil\\"" 1954.  Hopefully these 3 Bernard Hermann film soundtracks are still available to music fans who want to complete their 'Lost in Space' music collections."
550,5,"A cornerstone of any comprehensive Beethoven recording collection, Deutsche Grammophon 's recording of the Emerson String Quartet performing Beethoven's string quartets not only possesses excellent sonic characteristics, but also proves to be a rich performance by one of the outstanding string quartets of this generation. The technical accuracy of the Emerson's performance, coupled with the recording mastery of DG, provides a rewarding listening experience for any Beethoven fan, and perhaps particularly so for those interested in studying Beethoven's efforts within the string quartet genre. If you are a student of string quartets in general and Beethoven in particular, or if you are just looking for a great recording of all of Beethoven's string quartets, this set will undoubtedly become a valuable addition to your collection. Like me, you'll also likely find that these recordings will bring you years of enjoyment as you work through each of these stunningly performed pieces by the Emerson String Quartet."
551,4,"Don't worry, the vocals aren't all in Spanish, but he does throw in some lines here and there, but the effect is actually good. The sound has elements of hispanic music mixed with a traditional nu-metal approach. This album is by far their best, and rocks pretty hard, with screaming and melodic singing. Christian, the singer, has a good voice and sets this band apart from most nu-metal acts. These guys are probably not for everyone, but if you like to try some different sounding metal, you should check them out."
552,4,"once you've been bitten by the coltrane bug, you will most likely be compelled to search out every recording that he is to be heard on. it's a sickness, but a good one. this album gets lots of mixed reviews, here on amzazon, as well in jazz books. well, i like it just fine. sure there's better coltrane out there. so feel free to take some time getting around to this album. but once you do, i think you will find it a quite likable jazz set. my cd has the blue note label on it (blue note issued it in 1962 under coltrane's name), but this was originally a united artists release from 1959, under cecil taylor's name. it was then called \\""stereo drive.\\"" i can see why cecil taylor fans might not get all hot and bothered over this album. i have heard better, more inventive playing from mr taylor. but coltrane's performance is very worthwhile, as is kenny dorham's trumpet playing. the rhythm section of chuck isreals (bass) and louis hayes (drums) perform very well, too. so all you coltrane maniacs out there, don't shy away from this disc."
553,5,"With so many different versions of some songs available, and some left off competely (Octopus' Garden, Goodnight, Conquistador, etc.), this is a huge and welcome addition to any Ringo (or classic rock) collection--but even at the risk of repeating several songs, the alternate versions of some of Ringo's classics with different line-ups, plus the extra material not used (partially for that reason) beg for a sequel!"
554,5,Bear McCreary is one of the best composers. His combination of different musical themes are breathtaking and emotional.
555,4,"Forgotten all about this CD, as I remember checking it out awhile back. Always nice to experience an obscure title like this once again. Might be Heru Avenger's sole effort. Not exactly sure on that. Only way I could even come close to describing the four lengthy tracks here are like Zappa meets krautrock, then taking some lessons of fusion jazz from a third source. \\""Neteru 2000\\"" has a good groove and solid beat to it, \\""Theban Dawn\\"" is a bit funky, in some ways it reminds me of, say Alien Planetscapes, \\""Giza Now\\"" features some really good synth work and \\""Priestess Of Nu\\"" is a well written psych-jazz piece. Heru Avenger is basically one member, John Basil who plays guitar, synth, bass and drums. Gets better with each spin."
556,5,"For those who enjoyed the Garden State soundtrack, this is another winner."
557,5,"After a while of putting off buying Zaireeka since it seemed too bizarre, I finally gave in and got it. When it first came I also didn't listen to it for a few weeks since it seemed like too much of a hastle to line up 4 CDs. Eventually I had a day after class with little to do so I finally listened to Zaireeka. Listening to it was totally unlike listening to any other album I've ever heard. The album has its highs and its lows, but the whole time the listener is taken on a journey. The music isn't some part of the background, it becomes a part of the environment. I suggest this album to anyone who is a big Flaming Lips fan or looking for something truly interesting to listen to with a couple friends."
558,5,"He's no Melchior, but no one is.  Heppner is the first in a long while to even be mentioned in the same breath as the great heldentenors of the past, and that's no mean feat.  In this recording, he displays the all the hallmarks of a great Wagnerian singer: intelligence, immaculate breath control, and richness of tone.  This is a must-buy."
559,5,"Four years ago it was a complete fluke that \\""Love Is Blind\\"" ended up in my music collection.  Its ethereal sound took me by surprise, and not only that, the mood through the CD varied from melancholy to hopeful making sure not to leave one in a cadaverous state.  The vocals are both haunting and heavenly making one unsure if they are indeed in hell or paradise.   <br /> <br />It was this CD that opened me up to a whole new world of \\""dark wave\\"" sounds and musicians including Cocteau Twins, Hungry Lucy, Collide, which then lead me to the unearthly sounds of Dead Can Dance and Delirium.  If you recognize any of these musicians, you just may enjoy \\""Love Is Blind\\"".  If you enjoy \\""Love Is Blind\\"" but desire something harder and with more beat I recommend checking out Clair Voyant's collaboration CD \\""Time Again\\""."
560,5,"amazing album front to back.  Jonah Jenkins from Only Living Witness, Milligram, Miltown and Raw Radar War singing the first half of \\""Grim Heart/Black Rose\\"" is worth the price alone.  \\""Orphaned\\"" is another standout track.. sounds like Doomriders a little bit.  other great songs: Heartache, No Heroes, Lonewolves... all of them."
561,5,Wicked is a fabulous soundtrack.  Anyone who likes good music will enjoy this cd.
562,5,"I discovered, after hearing my first Hayley Westenra album, that I am easily hypnotized by a high pure woman's voice singing things melodic.  For some reason this embarasses me.  Of course, I think of myself as one of those godawful intellectuals who have long conversations about Back's inner voices.  I have to sneak away from myself to enjoy something that is simply pure and melodic, something which, in this day and age, puts emotion and beauty first.<br /><br />Well there, I've confessed. Chloe Agnew does a wonderful job of picking music that fits her voice perfectly and then being perfect with it.  The selection runs from classical to popular, and there isn't a loser in the bunch.  What I would really like to know is why there is only one Chloe Agnew album on this continent (or any other).  She is another young, fresh voice like Hayley Westenra and deserves every bit of recognition she gets."
563,5,"This is such a beautiful album; Joan Armatrading never sounds better. This album so clearly presages later artists such as Traci Chapman et al, and this album is superb. I've enjoyed it for many years and if you like Joan you will LOVE this album -- and everyone should know and experience this seminal and influential musician."
564,1,"This CD has little to offer a jazz guitar fan.  Very amateur sounding guitar playing, and not at all the desirable tone expected from a jazz guitar.  True, the rhythm section is good but the sound quality doesn't even do them justice.  I think someone stood in front of the band holding a mic.  Listen to the sound samples offered.  If you like it, what can I say?  But unless you own everything Joe Pass, Wes, Howard Alden, Bruce Foreman, Barney Kessell and SO many other I can't list and you are just dying to buy another jazz guitar CD, don't waste you money on this one."
565,5,"Are You Dreaming is an eclectic collection of techno-tribal beat music by One At Last, encompassing multiple genres of spiritual, chanting, and prayer.  The group manages to weave their upbeat and unique sound into a lively and mesmerizing album.  This album is definitely packed with energy and rhythm and one cannot help but move to its beat. I especially loved track 8 - Yanna Hu Wey - a Native American prayer set to a chant with great tribal Native American influence throughout. I could listen to this track over and over and get completely lost its rhythm and power. Jaya Lakshmi, lead female vocalist, has a beauty and clarity about her voice and those qualities shine and resonate beautifully throughout each track. I look forward to hearing more from this passionate and talented group of musicians!"
566,5,"The late 80's brought a change to country music.  In my opinion, country music was turned into wimpy rock, with cutesy funny clever lyrics, like the one about where the guy's wife took the keys to his truck but she forgot about his John Deere.  Or \\""Welcome to Earth, Third Rock from the Sun.\\""  And who can ever forget, \\""What Part of No Don't You Understand.\\""<br /><br />When I was a kid, my dad played Willie Nelson a lot.  One album I vaguely remembered was the soundtrack to \\""Honeysuckle Rose.\\""  While it isn't the greatest movie, I remember thinking that it was a great vehicle to show Willie playing live.<br /><br />I just recently bought this CD and after several listens believe that this is what great country music sounds like live.  Very much like a rock show, the energy level is greater than what one would expect from country like \\""The Grand Ole Opery\\"" or \\""Hee Haw.\\""<br /><br />It's not only Willie Nelson, either.  There's a great version of \\""I Don't Do Windows\\"" on here, and the fiddle playing on \\""Fiddlin' Around\\"" is great.  The lyrics are simple, like any simple rock song, but they serve as a nice compliment to the fiddle solos.<br /><br />Totally recommended for the fans of \\""Outlaw\\"" country."
567,5,"This CD includes the following songs: 1) Casta diva 2) O mio babbino caro 3) Va' pensiero 4)Plaisir d' amour  5) Habanèra  6)Un bel dì vedremo  7) La barcarolle  8)Ave Mari  9)Vissi d'arte 10)Che luce sei  11)Dove andiamo noi  12) I'alba verrà  13) Lost boys calling  14) Coro a bocca chiusa  15) Addio del passato  16) S'apre per te il mio cuor  17) Il rosso amore  18) Up to the light  19) Il canto della terra  20) Maternita  21) Stella. <br />Let me inform you tha Filippa also made a new version of Prima Donna for Mexico, that includes wonderful versions from the songs: \\""Me he enamorado de tí\\"" (Woman in love), \\""Cómo he de vivir sin tu cariño\\"" (How am I supposed to live without you), O terra addio (duet with Marcello Giordano). Enjoy her album!!!!  ;-D"
568,5,"It is very difficult to describe how amazing this album is. Though all of the songs are familiar, they have been reworked into an awesome feast of sound. I would recommend the CD & DVD audio version, the DVD sound is \\""toppermost of the poppermost,\\"" as John would have said. I've rated this with 5 stars, because Amazon does not allow more."
569,4,"A great underated band, this selection could have been better, but as a taster its ok. It does give a new listener an idea of how good they were."
570,5,"When Brett came out with his first album, I thought to myself, \\""wow, i don't know how he's going to top this cd, every song on here is great\\"". But when So Much More came out, it completely blew my mind away. I haven't heard anything so unique and powerful in my life. This is a MUST BUY"
571,5,"I'm proud to be the first reviewer on here to say that I was aware of Ryan's career long before his time on the show \\""Rockstar Supernova.\\""  I first discovered Ryan Star's music over 3 years ago in the form of the band Stage, who opened up for Eve 6 at a small concert club.  I thought that Stage stole the show, and I bought a copy of their self-titled album there at the concert and have since fallen in love with it.  I would highly recommend it to any of you, it's a beautiful rock album with powerful guitars and lush piano melodies, and of course Ryan's awesome voice.  Anyway, the band was together for 10 years, but broke up shortly after being signed to Maverick records and putting out only one album.  So this brings us to Ryan's first solo effort...<br /><br />I was actually excited to learn that this entire album consists of just Ryan singing and playing piano, with the occasional drums and acoustic guitar.  I thought that the best parts of Stage's album was when it was just Ryan and a piano, even though I love hard rock music.  This entire album is beautiful, moving, and often melancholy.  It begins with the subtle We Might Fall which pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the CD.  The next song, So Ordinary, is much more uplifting, and it's probably the most popular song on here.  My favorite track is Losing Your Memory, it's probably one of the most moving songs I've ever heard.  Other stand out songs are Back Of Your Car, Sink Or Swim, and O...all of which had originally been written to be on Stage's second album that was never completed.  There's also a re-worked version of Perfect (which appeared as a guitar-driven track on Stage's album) and The One You Know.  Famous Love and The First Time are also very beautiful!  It's important to realize that this is NOT a rock album.  The whole point of this CD was for Ryan to drop the rock band, and get back to the organic sound that these songs had when he first wrote them.  Ryan himself best described this CD as a musician playing alone in his living room, but who is performing for the whole world to hear.<br /><br />Full track listing:<br />01) We Might Fall<br />02) So Ordinary<br />03) Famous Love<br />04) Losing Your Memory<br />05) Psycho Suicidal Girls<br />06) O<br />07) Back Of Your Car<br />08) Saw You In Heaven<br />09) The Same When I'm Alone<br />10) Dance With You<br />11) Sink Or Swim<br />12) Perfect<br />13) Famous Yet<br />14) The First Time<br />15) Waiting For Love<br />16) Here Son<br />17) Take A Ride With Me<br />18) The Fairy Tale<br />19) The One You Know<br />20) Lullaby Suicidean playing alone in his living room, but who is performing for the whole world to hear.

572,5,"Atlantis is K-Os' third CD and he continues to ascend to perfection. K-Os is incredibly creative and multi-faceted. He is arguably Hip-Hops' most literate lyricist. His vocals can be unigue or invoke the sounds of Prince, Michael Jackson and even the Marleys. Several genres of music are covered ranging from soul, rock, Hip-Hop and even Reggae. K-Os surpasses KRS-ONE and Common as a vocalist, writer and composer of music. He is very spiritual and compassionate evidenced by his vegetarianism and animal rights advocacy. I wish this Canadian Superstar can obtain world-wide acclaim. He is remarkably talented, visionary, cerebral, musical, innovative and profound. His previous CD's \\""Exit\\"" and \\""Joyful Rebellion\\"" are also bona fide masterpieces. K-Os is one of a kind and he wants to make the world a safer and more humane place for all of its inhabitants"
573,5,"Here's an excellent and representative collection of Karl Jenkins' best compositions and arrangements.  Buy this one first if you're still not sure you want to invest in a half-dozen Adiemus-type recordings.  I predict that, if you listen to this one, you'll want more."
574,2,"Track with Paul Wall is okay, others have no depth. I was not impressed by this CD. I love the Hogan's, but not impressed by Brooke's CD. I was expecting alot more from the album considering it was produced by Scott Storch and the Hit Factory, Storch has had some good hits lately. Just my 2 cents..."
575,5,"The following is an except of a review I originally wrote for EDDIE KENDRICKS: THE MOTOWN SOLO ALBUMS VOL. 1. It is to give you an idea of what to expect on this wonderful album!  <br /> <br />PEOPLE...HOLD ON, with its eye-catching photography by Weldon A. McDougal III, was originally released in May 1972, which fared better on the charts (#13 R&B, #131 Pop).  Frank Wilson said in an interview for Eddie's ULTIMATE COLLECTION (1998) that it was a concept album dedicated to black America.  It opens with IF YOU LET ME (#17 R&B, #66 Pop), originally performed by Jimmy Ruffin.  LET ME RUN INTO YOUR LONELY HEART  is the funky B-side to EDDIE'S LOVE (#35 R&B, #77 Pop) while on DAY BY DAY, Eddie's vocals are once again multi-layered.  GIRL YOU NEED A CHANGE OF MIND is the biggest hit off here (#13 R&B, #87 Pop) with its innovative use of multi-drums throughout the track and still a favorite among club goers.  SOMEDAY WE'LL HAVE A BETTER WORLD has a gospel feel to it and reminiscent of Stevie Wonder's HEAVEN HELP US ALL with Eddie singing in his natural register.  MY PEOPLE...HOLD ON is a major highlight here with African drums opening the song and on the break and DATE WITH THE RAIN is another dance favorite among today's club goers.  I'M ON THE SIDELINE has Eddie's voice once again multi-layered throughout the song and the album closes with JUST MEMORIES, the B-side to IF YOU LET ME and with it's operatic opening, remains another highlight to this album."
576,5,"This opera is exceptional! For one thing, it is tri-lingual - in French, German and Italian. No, I am not kidding! Telemann not only was a true internationalist vis-&agrave;-vis musical styles, he was clearly quite cool with his singers singing Italian-styled arias in Italian, French style arias in French and German in most other places. The result is actually quite delightful.<br /><br />On the musical front, Telemann showcases a range of musical styles. Some of this opera sounds like it was lifted from an opera by Andr&eacute; Campra or Rameau. Some of it is in an elegant Italian Opera Buffa and Opera Seria styles and some of it sounds like proto-Mozart, in the Galante style.<br /><br />Telemann was a great composer, that's for sure!<br /><br />The cast of this opera is excellent and many of them also appear in Jacobs' other excellent recording of Reinhard Keiser's Croesus. Dorothea R&ouml;schmann, Roman Trekel and Werner G&uuml;ra appear on both recordings. The wonderful and beautiful Isabelle Poulenard and Maria Cristina Kiehr appear in Orpheus and the role of Eurydice is sung by Ruth Ziesak, who is new to me. Countertenor, Axel K&ouml;hler sings the minor role of Ascalax and, although I don't mind his voice, a better countertenor could have been chosen.<br /><br />The RIAS-Kammerchor and the Akademie f&uuml;r Alte Musik Berlin are in fine form and the entire opera is a joy to listen to from start to finish. Ren&eacute; Jacobs is to be commended for bringing this delightful opera to us."
577,5,"I have all the MMW albums through the latest - End of the World Party - and Friday Afternoon in the Universe is, in my opinion, their definitive album. It has all the elements that make MMW special - sensuous, funky grooves flowing in and out of free-form improv sections, a sense of freedom within structure and perfectly demonstrates the band's passion for their music. Three consumate musicians playing with supreme intuition and a overriding feeling of joy and discovery. I'm a drummer, and I can honestly say that Billy Martin never sounded so creative, so alive, so inspired. And even though I'm not a keyboard player, I have to say that this is probably John Medeski's most varied, most transcendant, most adventurous playing on record. If you are buying your first MMW album, this should be it. If you are already a MMW fan and are considering picking adding this to your collection, do it IMMEDIATELY! You won't be disappointed. This is pure MMW at the height of their game."
578,5,"I'm going to handle this the same was as Kiss Me and not say anything about the CD itself, what for?  We all know it by heart anyway.  The bonus stuff?  Interesting, but hardly essential.<br /><br />The question is how has the music improved from the \\""standard\\"" CD?  Methodology? I ripped the new CD using Winamp, and to be fair, re-ripped the old one, using the same settings. I kept neither one, because some kid on usenet did an even better job than me . . . hey, that's fair, I bought this, so quiet now. I'm not about to cheat Bob. In any case, I made a new playlist in Winamp and flipped back and forth between the rips.<br /><br />Results? Like Kiss Me, more presence and punch in the new versions vs. the old. Is it startling? No, and it's possible that I could have tweaked the settings to bring up the old version to sound similar. Limitations? X-Fi driving an HK 3400 into Ascends and a Sony subwoofer . . . and totally wrecked 55 year old ears.<br /><br />Recommendation?  Cure fans must of course have it.  No one else is listening, so I don't suppose it matters much what else I say!  But it's not an earthshaking improvement I'm afraid.  Faith was helped quite a bit, the original was kind of muddy in comparison, but as you go forward the improvements get harder to find.  Ah well, let's move onto the grail.  I'm sure that will bring the audiophiles out of the woodwork!"
579,5,"The one reviewer, who complains about the sound quality of this new rerelease obviously hasn't listened to the old, non-remastered cd versions in a long time. Songs such as \\""Be On Your Way\\"" and \\""Hickory Grove\\"" definitely have a fuller sound, and if you listen to the drum intro to the wonderful \\""Illinois\\"" and compare it to the previous versions, even the remastered one on the 1997 \\""Portrait\\"" box set, you'll no longer doubt the improved sound quality. These are among Dan Fogelberg's very best albums, so this is a great package. I really hope Bgo Records will continue to rerelease Dan's old records. I can't wait for my all-time favorite album (\\""Nether Lands\\"")to be remastered. Love ya, Dan."
580,4,"Thats because its not metal, its hardcore bro. But, to review this cd i would say that this a very good cd. It is nothing unexpected if you have followed raised fist for awhile. Very tight songwriting, nothing too complicated instrumentally, just good clean hardcore, but i would contend that the singer has one of the best voices in hardcore, it's not incomprehensible screams as some bands are prone to do. Its yelling with a message and definitely worth checking out. I have loved all of their cd's and this definitely did not disappoint."
581,5,"My review title is directed both at the stellar new album from Xtina, and to the other reviewers who claim that she \\""overdid it\\"" on this album. Her voice is her instrument and she should be allowed to play around and have fun with it - she has so much talent that I spend most of my time listening to her just in complete awe of her abilities. I have always appreciated that she takes her time between albums so that she actually has something to write about, rather than cranking out continuous bilge like so many other musicians do. This set of cd's contains a diverse range of songs, and I cannot say that I dislike any of them. I say, congratulations Christina. You clearly took a risk with this kind of album and not everyone can handle it, but if anyone had any remaining doubts, it proves that you are a TRUE artist. Thank you, and keep 'em coming!"
582,5,"The third Jandek voice-only recording(the other two are Put My Dream On This Planet and This Narrow Road). A performance without pretense or unnecessary ornamentation. Difficult and rewarding. Tired of \\""trading green paper for something to do?\\"" Here's an alternative."
583,4,"Man, it's been awhile!  But I'm back!  And so is Tom!  AVA is definitely not the Tom-in-the-box machine all blink/boxcar fans hoped it would be, but so what?  We already know Tom is good at punk!  Why not try his hands at anthemic arena?  (See my review of \\""Who We Are Instead\\"" by Jars Of Clay) <br />       I'm ceaselessly amazed at how many people are so protective of the past.  So many people were shocked at how drastically different from blink AVA is.  Not only shocked...depressed.  I, frankly am overjoyed.  For me, Blink was mostly, as Tom himself put it in a Blink song, \\""...a f***in nightmare\\"".  All they did was whine about problems that haven't existed since high-school, how stupid Christian parents are, and about b**chy girlfriends.  Well guess what, music fans?  Tom grew up!  Woah! <br />       AVA is much more introspective, musically and lyrically.  There's even a respectful reference to God in \\""A Little's Enough\\"".  The melodies are often less than spectacular, hovering around one note a lot, etc.  And Tom's over-pronounced words occasionally clash with the sleepy / electric rock that is AVA.  That's what docked this thing a star.  Otherwise, the best word to describe this project is: REFRESHING!  A punker doing sleepy prog?  Hells, yeah!  I was amazed when I heard this band on myspace the first time.  I had no idea DeLonge was involved.  Small world. <br />       If you dislike AVA, dislike it for whatever internal problems you might see, like the ones I've seen.  But to hate AVA just cause they ain't Blink or Boxcar, is like saying you hate Sting cause he's not The Police anymore.  Come on, people!  Different band, different name?  Yes, hell, they SHOULD SOUND different too!  A debt to U2?  Definitely.  But as long as we're on the subject of debts...name one modern band out there anywhere in the world that doesn't owe a huge debt to the Beatles, eh?  Every band owes some other band something.  Get over it.      <br />       Personally, I think AVA is the next step in musical evolution for all four of those guys, and I hope they continue to evolve.  The lyrics on this project are especially astounding, coming from Tom.  Seriously, pick it up.  Give it a listen.  At the very least read all the lyrics on the web.  See if you don't feel refreshed, or at least pleasantly surprised."
584,5,"Along with Islands and Starless and Bible Black(see my review) this is the absolute peak of King Crimson. In 1972 King Crimson (the Peter Sinfield era) completely dissintegrated after a disasterous tour that produced the subpar live album Earthbound. Many believed this to be the end of King Crimson. However this was not the case a year later Larks Tongues in Aspic was released to the world and what an album it is. Completely departing from Crimsons former somber symphonic style, Lark's is an avant garde masterpiece that is absolutely drenched in darkness as well as beauty. Kicking off with the blueprint to every extended instrumental King Crimson has done since is LTIA part 1. This song show Fripps new found approach to songwriting, slowly building tension that ends with an explosive climax. The entire song is a roller coaster of sounds ranging from David Cross's beautiful(and more than a little sinister) violin soloes to Fripps Sabbathesque guitar passages, this song is more than a little strange. Even stranger is the fact that the song is followed up by a short ballad(Book Of Saturdays) that is the complete musical oppisite of the opening song. Exiles follows and is the second best song off the album. This song like the last song is a wonderful ballad driven by violin, mellotron, and Fripps acoustic guitar. John Wetton does a great job with the vocals. Easy Money is a fantastic rocker loaded with distortion and a great solo from Fripp. The Talking Drum is pretty much just an extended intro for the final song on the album but its a great build up. The closing song is LTIA part 2 which in my humble opinion is King Crimsons best instrumental. Alternating between heavy distorted passages and an absolutely awe inspiring interlude, this song is the reason i bought the album. <br />The musicianship on this album is top notch with all the players being virtuoso's at their instruments you would not expect the playing to be as tight as it is as tight as it is but in fact for an album that was part improvised this is some of the tightest group interplay I have ever heard. Wetton also does a great job at singing in the very few spots on this album that have vocals. Overall this is one of the greatest albums ever made and deserves to be in any serious music collection. This album is the very definition of Progressive."
585,4,"I like it. The voice is surprising, takes some getting used to, but I like it very much. I like that all the songs don't sound alike."
586,4,"I love it even more! It is absolutely great. Awesome beats, a wonderful vocalist----love her voice. I find myself dancing and singing to this all the time. I think I may even be addicted. I have to admit that even my mother likes it! :) One complaint I would have about it is that at the beginning of some songs (everytime we touch, wouldn't it be good) it sounds as if they are the same songs. A little more variation in the beats would have made it five stars, but 4 ain't bad! Go out and buy it you'll love it"
587,5,"What a great song from Maria, former singer of Lone Justice. Love it."
588,5,"Hey just thought you'd like to know that the background sampled track for \\""CRAZY\\"" comes from a film soundtrack \\""PREPARATI LA BARA!\\"" by Gianfranco/Piero Reverberi.

Guess I'm just cooler than everyone!"
589,5,"Coming after endless years of flabby glam and mushy disco, this album reminded us of what rock and roll is supposed to be.  From beginning to end, it is so relentlessly tough, edgy, and downright overpowering that it will rearrange your teeth in their sockets.  As a public safety consideration, do not play this CD while driving in your car.  Easily the best debut album by anybody, ever."

592,2,"Poor Erasure.<br /><br />While many of their peer's from the 80's and 90's such as Depeche Mode, Duran Duran, and the Pet Shop Boys have evolved, Erasure seems stuck in a mold they can't break out of.  Sure the group had their share of the success back in the day, but in my mind, their last really good album was 1991's Chorus (with the possible exception of the self-titled album from 1995).  Since then, it seems the duo of Vince Clarke and Andy Bell have been struggling to find a place in a music world that has turned away from the Erasure's signature synth-pop sound.  In recent years, they have embarrassed themselves by releasing inferior albums like 2002's Loveboat and 2003's Other People's Songs.  The former was not even released stateside (most likely because their record label knew it was a dud), while the latter was an ill-conceived attempt at an album of cover songs.  Only did last year's Nightbird give a glimmer of hope that the group might be back on track and not ready to hang up their synthesisers yet.<br /><br />So now comes Erasure's latest attempt at relevancy, the acoustic album Union Street.  I was lucky enough to be sent an advance copy of the album.  Rather than an album full of new songs, Union Street is a reworking of some of their previously released songs.  \\""We just felt there were songs on our albums that had been missed as songs,\\"" says Clarke.  \\""We found this cool guitarist [Steve Walsh] and a cool studio [Union Street] and decided to use both.\\""  The album was born from the idea that they \\""show the songs in a different light, and show they could work on whatever instrument, synthesisers or guitars,\\"" according to Andy Bell.<br /><br />When I heard about the project, I had very high hopes for this album.  The album's advance single \\""Boy\\"" (from the album Cowboy)  works beautifully as an acoustic piece.  The melody and yearning of the song got lost in the techno-synth-pop of its original arrangement.  Unfortunately, nothing else on the album works as well when given the acoustic treatment.<br /><br />The problem is made evident right off the bat with the album's second song. \\""Piano Song\\"" (from the album Wild!) sounds like it is a missing track off the Brokeback Mountain soundtrack with its twanging guitars.  It was an interesting choice for this album considering the song's title.  Ultimately though I think the song works better in its original piano format.<br /><br />That brings me to my biggest complaint about Union Street.  In choosing songs for the album, Clarke and Bell played it safe.  Nearly all the songs are fairly mellow in their original form, and doing an acoustic rendition of them is hardly an artistic stretch.  I would have loved to seen the duo roll the dice and take a chance on acoustic versions of some of their dance songs.  Can you imagine what unplugged versions of \\""Oh L'Amour,\\"" \\""Blue Savannah,\\"" or \\""Chorus\\"" might have sounded like?  Instead they ended up with baffling selections such as the aforementioned \\""Piano Song\\"" and \\""Rock Me Gently.\\""<br /><br />Some of the tracks on Union Street fare much better than others.  \\""How Many Times\\"" shows off the depth of Bell's voice, while \\""Spiralling\\"" benefits from the gentle plucking of the guitar.  \\""Stay With Me\\"" is tepid and boring.  Other tracks such as the gospel-tinged \\""Rock Me Gently\\"" are just a mess.  \\""Home\\"" starts off well, but flounders when it hits the \\""time will come\\"" chorus.  On \\""Blues Away,\\"" Bell's falsetto singing sounds out of place against the acoustic guitar.<br /><br />Overall, Union Street is an unconvincing effort.  The album is more of a curiosity piece or gimmick than a new work. It hardly reinforces the positive vibes Nightbird left us with. Die-hard Erasure fans might be amused, but the rest of us, I fear, will be left unimpressed.m works as well when given the acoustic treatment. <br /> <br />The problem is made evident right off the bat with the album's second song. \\""Piano Song\\"" (from the album Wild!) sounds like it is a missing track off the Brokeback Mountain soundtrack with its twanging guitars.

594,3,"As a Numan fan since 1979 I have watched the highs and lows of his career.It is difficult to criticise sometimes because <br />creatively all artists go thru bad patches and you've got to accept that. This album sadly, for me, comes across as a disappointing extension of 'Pure'. There is not a lot new here, the opening track does not set the scene, in fact the first 3 tracks sound very similar. There are a couple of great tracks, 'In a dark place' stands out for me, but most of the album is, I hate to say, 'same old same old'. There is a distinct overuse of certain negative words (bleed,cry etc), which gets a bit depressing after a while. I expect an album to put you down then lift you up, then throw you of a cliff !! - I just felt down after listening to 'Jagged'. I expected something better than 'Pure', especially after a five year gap. Maybe 'Pure' is destined to be his standout album. <br />  <br /> <br />"
595,3,"This recording, taken from a live broadcast by the Australian Opera in 1979, features Sutherland as Elettra, the \\""bad girl\\"" of Mozart's rarely performed opera seria - a relatively small supporting role, considering Sutherland's current repertoire at the time of Lucia, Norma and similar bel canto showpieces.  Sutherland herself made the comment that Elettra gave her the chance to sit quietly in her dressing room and get more needlepoint done! <br /> <br />The CD is not so much a series of highlights as simply all of Elettra's appearances in the opera, ranging from solo arias to participation in several ensemble pieces, and occasionally when one of these scenes runs into the next we get to hear (briefly) some of the other singers from the production. <br /> <br />Elettra spends most of the opera furious that she can't win the attentions of Idamante, Idomeneo's son, who is more interested in the princess Ilia.  This gives Sutherland plenty of opportunity for strong declamatory singing, and the heaviness in the voice at this stage of her career contrasts very effectively against Leona Mitchell's limpid and lyrical Ilia in the quartet Andro rammingo e solo.  Elettra's final furious vengeance aria D'Oreste, D'Ajace, where she spits out staccato descending melodic scales with machine-gun accuracy, is vintage Sutherland and tremendously exciting to listen to. <br /> <br />There is strong support from the other cast members.  Margreta Elkins is a powerful but sweet-voiced Idamante, whose rich mezzo also negotiates the high reaches of the role with great accuracy.  Sergei Baigildin in the title role was actually the understudy, after original tenor Ron Stevens succumbed to the huge vocal demands of the role after only a few performances, and gives a solid if slightly unexciting Idomeneo (although I think anyone who can get through singing this hugely difficult role deserves a medal anyway).  Clifford Grant is briefly sonorous as the offstage voice of Neptune, and the orchestra and chorus under Bonynge overcome occasional messiness to provide good overall support. <br /> <br />An interesting and enjoyable addition to the CD collection of all Sutherland admirers, and an opportunity to hear her live in one of her most unusual later career roles.  Interesting trivia:  the production was designed by John Truscott, the Australian designer who won the Oscar for his work on the film of CAMELOT."
596,5,"In offering my praise of this duel CD it's hard to know where to begin. First I suppose I should mention the flawlessness of the playing. Fred Oldenburg (whoever that is) is superb. There is not a wrong note to be heard on either CD. I find the level of technical competency to be fascinating. This CD was a tremendous undertaking for one pianist. As an amateur pianist myself, I can say with great certainty that to play Czerny's \\""Art of Finger Dexterity\\"" properly is no small task, even for professionals. And Liszt's Transcendental Etudes are universally considered some of the most fearsome pieces ever written for solo piano. Yet both are presented here flawlessly. So bravo to Fred Oldenburg.<br /><br />Second, I shall briefly touch upon the recording quality. All that I really can say is that is it also excellent, and just serves to further compliment the playing. I could easily hear every note with distinct and brilliant clarity. The sonic effect was perfectly streamlined throughout.<br /><br />Third, this set is very well put together. With Czerny and Liszt you have the champions of two distinct schools, even though Czerny taught Liszt. Those distinctions could not be clearer when listening to these CD's. Czerny's etudes are pedagogical and systematic (some would say cold and unfeeling). They are brilliant though whatever you believe. Czerny did not add needless ornamentation. That is not to say though that he was simplistic, since they are fiendishly difficult.  He represents probably the epitome of the \\""old school\\"" of etude composition. Czerny's great masterpiece is aptly called \\""The Art of Finger Dexterity\\"" for a reason. If you complete all the studies within, your fingers will be most dexterous. And that is all Czerny seeks to accomplish. Many who listen to \\""The Art of Finger Dexterity\\"" may be put off by the admittedly narrow focus of its aims, and as my father says, a somewhat \\""grating quality.\\"" But it is truly a historical piece. Czerny's etudes would serve as the musical backbone, in one way or another, for virtually every other solo piano piece written for the next 50 years. And to transition, it would be impossible to play Liszt's Transcendental Etudes (which were dedicated to Czerny) without first mastering \\""The Art Finger Dexterity.\\""<br /><br />The Transcendental Etudes are actually not a revolution as much as they an evolution, albeit a very great evolution. For Liszt did not, throw out the past conventions of his teacher, but rather built upon them. Liszt approaches the etude quite differently to Czerny, in fact he redefines them. The Czerny etude was principally a study piece. They were meant for moderately advanced students to learn so they could move on to greater pianistic challenges. Liszt's Etudes are far removed from that mold. (Certainly no piano student I know ever takes up the Transcendental Etudes as study pieces). They are meant to be played by only the foremost pianists in the world. They don't just have ornamentation, they glory in them. Liszt adds every little frill he can. They are etudes written outside the realm of pedagogy. And that is the critical difference.<br /><br />Listening to the Czerny and then the Liszt respectively allows the listener to delight in the aforementioned progression. Both from an analytical and casual listening standpoint, this set has provided me with endless enjoyment. For only $12.00 it's unassailable in every way<br /><br />Highly Recommended<br /><br /> Rembrandt Q.

597,5,Every song on this album is perfect and familiar. There really isn't much else I can say about this essential classic.
598,4,"I bought this CD for the Soft Cell cover of Sex Dwarf, which is fantastic, but the rest of the record is just so so...I love a good swear word, of which there are plenty, but this record just seems very juvenile....but what the hell do i know?!"
599,5,"I have heard Paddy perform live with her previous band, Main Street, and fell in love with her music instantly. In this CD, her music comes alive, takes hold of you heart, and won't let go! Paddy has such a powerful, soulful, intimate voice, that you will become addicted to her music. I assure you, if you buy this CD, you will never regret it, and you'll be begging for more!"
600,5,"I got this fantastic album for Christmas. It is my first experience with Kashmir, although I have heard people raving about this band for a few years. At first listening it seemed a little bland, but the more I have been listening to it, the better I like it. This is not mind-numbing hit-list music but row-upon-row of great, moody songs. Whenever I take out this album, I tend to put the CD-player on perpetual repeat."
601,5,"When I first bought Shenanigans, I didn't even know it was a compilation of Green Day's B-side tracks. Every song except the fairly crappy \\""Do Da Da\\"" is just as good as any regular Green Day song, in fact most of them are better. The rhythms on Shenanigans are also significantly different for every melody, with some tunes being slow and swinging (On the Wagon) and some being upbeat and noisy (Desensitized). My favorite song on this CD is definitely \\""Ha Ha You're Dead\\"", which is most commendable for its great chorus. The chorus features fine lyrics, a quick beat, and a really catchy chord progression. \\""Ha Ha You're Dead\\"" would probably be one of my top five favorite Green Day songs of all time, closely followed by \\""Desensitized\\"". \\""Desensitized\\"" has a sweet intro which features some guy shouting and objects falling over, and then picks up a guitar pattern which eventually leads into a loud and melodically superb chorus. All of the songs featured on this compilation ought to have been on regular albums, because they have such great rhythms and catchiness factors. No Green Day album collection is complete with Shenanigans! I would recommend it very much because it is full of variety, has perhaps the best rhythms of any Green Day CD, and is catchy as usual. Five stars!"
602,5,"Don Pullen was one of the unsung original masters of jazz piano.  This collection exemplifies his incredible skill, originality, intensity, and emotion.  At times, he appears to be all over the place, while never losing sight of thematic and rhythmic imperatives.  <br /> <br />George Adams, on tenor and flute, which isn't mentioned in the liner notes, is even more unsung than Pullen.  This is unfortunate because he too is a master at his trade who has gotten very little attention. Listen closely and you will witness some work of true brilliance. <br /> <br />The cuts involving Gary Peacock on bass are really of interest.  Where Pullen is at times flying across the keys in, seemingly, all directions, such as on Reap the Whirlwind, Peacock is like a rock, grounding everything with a steady, firm line.  He really brings it all together.   <br /> <br />Don Pullen cds were, for a long time, very hard to come-by.  Mosaic has, once again, done itself proud by releasing some incredibe, heretofore difficult to find musical gems in this collection."
603,2,"About once a year, I get this CD out and try once more.  I love Christmas music, lullabies, and Shawn Colvin, but this album just doesn't work for me. <br /> <br />I think it's because she doesn't really do anything new or interesting with the music and her voice sounds (IMHO) *too* bare and stripped down--like a 12-year-old girl singing Christmas music to herself.  I got bored/frustrated with track after indifferent-sounding track.  This one's going to the Goodwill this year. <br /> <br />For what it's worth, I have three other Shawn Colvin albums and love songs like \\""Shotgun Down the Avalanche\\"" and \\""Round of Blues\\"".  I just think the girlish lilt and untrained nature of her voice seem to work better with her own compositions."
604,3,"\\""Perfect Love\\"" is the first single off Simply Red's new CD \\""Simplified\\"".  It is Simply Red's attempt at a Latin-styled song, or a track with strong Latin influences.  The problem is, with their typical blue-eyed soul style they have a very hard time pulling it off.   <br /> <br />Simply Red's last two singles \\""Sunrise\\"" and \\""Fake\\"" were outstanding - and both became #1 club hits both in the U.S. and overseas.  \\""Perfect Love\\"" is now in the top five on the U.S. club chart as of this writing.  The mixes are interesting, certainly adding some flavor to the song.  By far the best is the Roger's Dirty Sanchez Mix which has a driving bassline.  The only drawback to this mix is that it only some of the vocals in it.  However, this is one of those songs where a remix might not work with the whole song.  The Love To Infinity mixes are nice mixes, but again, do not contain very much of the vocals which make them kind of disappointing. <br /> <br />As you get into the later tracks on the CD is where you get into the mixes that are closer to the original version of the song.  This is where you realize how almost cringe-worthy this song was at the beginning. <br /> <br />This track is ok, but IMO just doesn't measure up to \\""Sunrise\\"" and \\""Fake\\"".  You probably need to be a huge fan of Simply Red to really appreciate it. <br />"
605,1,"Like an athelete that played too long.... unfortunately John has played too long. I was/am one of the greatest fan of John's since I discovered him in the early 70s... seen him live a half a dozen times... I have all his albums and CDs... Unlike some of his masterpieces (like the Missing years), this album is very very disappointing... Unfortunately the lyrics lack creativity and the music is just a case of John taking his older songs and putting new words to them... I listened to the CD one time.... and sadly put it away... I am not sure why he did this. Maybe he needed money.... Still, I can seperate this CD from the others and excuse it...  nothing John could do could now will change or tarnish his previous body of work.... but I will be extremely cautious before I buy a new CD from John if he makes another one. <br /> <br />If you want to discover John... any of his earlier CDs will do..."

607,5,"Album Review <br /> <br />Artist: AC/DC <br /> <br />Album: High Voltage <br /> <br />Date Released: September 25, 1974 - Re-mastered August 25, 2000 <br /> <br />Label: Atlantic Records <br /> <br />Price: $9.99 <br /> <br /> Somewhere in the year 1973, AC/DC found themselves beating on the shores on the United States. Running from the no fame, no glory Australian musical prison surrounded by water. As the band played gigs around New York in local bar settings, they noticed that the singer Brian Adams was not working to his full potential. So, they fired him and hired their limo driver Bon Scott. With little singing experience, Bon Scott was a poet and sang his heart for all to hear.  <br />By the time 1974 came around, AC/DC had released High Voltage in the U.S. The album was shot down by music critics for its crude nature and unusual innuendos, but the American public soon came to love it and AC/DC was on their road to fame. Judging by the musical nature, they could be labeled as meathead power rock. AC/DC hailed from a multi-cultural background ranging from the blues all the way to rock `n' roll. Their main influences were from Chuck Berry and John Lee Hooker. The topics of their songs usually contain sex, drugs, and rock `n' roll. Most people have said in the past, \\""not for the faint of heart\\"". The band consists of five musicians, Angus Young-Lead guitar, Malcolm Young- Rhythm guitar, Bon Scott- Vocals, Cliff Williams- Bass guitar, and Phil Rudd- Drums. These five talented musicians soon took to the streets \\""trying to make a million\\"". As the band progressed, people started to see a rapid change in the image AC/DC portrayed. Going from bars to live shows, they soon were labeled as roughnecks that stirred up the young population turning fans from around the world. From drinking and causing fights, AC/DC moved fast to the top of the rock charts. Fans from around the world came to see the awesome wild ride they became to be. <br />First impressions are rare with these hoodlums. The music needs to sink in over time. My first impression was more like, \\""wow, these guys rock!\\"" The most basic impressions are more like its loud and fast. Not many bands can compare to these wild tone monsters, but the best example I could find would be Judas Priest.  <br />The first track that has caught my heart is \\""It's Along Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock `N' Roll)\\"". This song has got me good because I have formed a rock `n' roll band that has so much heart and soul as the great AC/DC did so many times, at so many shows. \\""It's along way to the top if you wanna rock `n' roll. If you think its easy doin' one night stands, try playin' in a rock roll band.\\"" It's along way to the top and people have to fight to get what they truly want in this life. <br />\\""Rock `N' Roll Singer\\"" is one of the finest tributes to anyone who had a dream and lived it. I see this song as a milestone in music because so many have tried to capture the true emotion of dreams, but never came close. \\""Gonna be a rock 'n' roll star. Well, I worked real hard and bought myself a rock 'n' roll guitar. I gotta be on top some day, I wanna be a star.\\"" These words are straight from the heart of the amazing Bon Scott and Malcolm Young. <br />\\""The Jack\\"" I didn't appreciate this song for a few reasons. One reason is that, the song is very simple and a little too slow. The other reason may come from lack of true \\""rock your socks off rhythm\\"". \\""Poker face was her name, poker face was her nature. Poker straight was her game, if she knew she could get ya.\\"" <br />\\""Live Wire\\"" Truly an amazing song that showed the listeners how tough AC/DC actually was, and how they viewed themselves. This songs riff amazes me because of its ballsy reputation. I'm as cool as a body on ice, or hotter than a rollin' dice. Send you to heaven, take you to hell. I ain't foolin', can't you tell.\\"" Chilling, isn't it.  <br />\\""T.N.T\\"" Over played but still one of the best. \\""So lock up your daughter, lock up your wife. Lock up the back door and run for your life. The man is back in town, don't you mess me 'round.\\"" Good stuff, I love it! <br />\\""Can I Sit Next to You Girl\\"" A good song if you want a lady. \\""I met this girl for the first time on Saturday night. Standing in the queue at the Odeon alright, then I took her by surprise. When I threw her one of my lines, she started smiling and being real fine (ha ha).\\"" I still can't get enough of Bon Scott and his way with words. <br />\\""Little Lover\\"" Ever have a girl that everyone wanted? This song really gets down and dirty with that subject. \\""I hope you liked the show. When the band said good night, I had to say hello.\\"" I like this song for it's rockin' rhythm and sweet lyrics.  <br />\\""She's Got Balls\\"" Little do people know about Bon, he had a wife that never called him and stole his money. \\""She's got balls my lady, likes to crawl my lady. On her hands and knees all around the floor, no one has to tell her what a fella is for\\"" Something about this song seems to help with break ups. <br />\\""High Voltage(Rock `N' Roll)\\"" This is the best, I love it. Some people wear ripped clothes, some people don't make enough money, and some people just don't care. Hey it's alright, just play some \\""High Voltage Rock `N' Roll\\"".  You ask me 'bout the clothes I wear and you ask me why I grow my hair. And you ask me why I'm in a band I dig doin' one night stands; you wanna see me do my thing. All you gotta do is plug me into high voltage rockin' roll.\\"" That's my favorite song on the cd, because I love Bon Scott and I love good music. The rhythm just takes my away.  <br /> In all the ways I could wrap this up, I leave the public with this. \\""Rockin' `N' Roll ain't noise pollution, rock `n' roll ain't gonna die.\\"" I assure anyone who buys this album will be pleased. If not, maybe it's not the style one's looking for. All I know is that, these guys love what they do and love the fans who back them up. That's one reason why these guys are my musical heroes. The fans will keep coming as the next album unfolds to the public. AC/DC is here to stay because people want it and these serve it. I think that their style has meloed out, but if a fifty year old man can play like he's twenty, they are here to stay.   <br />   <br />"
608,3,"I bought this CD before Sony pulled it. I really like it alot and play it almost daily in my truck. I was planning to put it on my IPod, but I'm glad I had not done that yet after reading the reviews. I'm even more glad that it was not available for me to purchase as a Christmas gift for someone. I'd hate to know I gave anyone something that screwed up their computer. Thank goodness I haven't loaned it to my office mate who listens to his LEGALLY PURCHASED CDs on the computer as he works. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, it is absolutely disgusting that the bad seeds out there, who have actively stolen music, have made it necessary for a company to feel they have to take these steps to protect their investment ... even though the people it has hurt most are the legitimate customers."
609,5,"Don't Listen to the 1 star reviews they just hate Madonna and have not heard the album at all you can tell from their reviews. Nothing about the album but the artist Madonna. Now for a review of each song.      Hung Up: Great song which samples Gimme Gimme Gimme A Man after Midnight the 1979 hit my ABBA. There is one part in this song where it slows down and you can hear 80's sound more pronounced and you hear a clock ticking then going off with another alarm clock going off at the same time, very clever. It smoothly moves into the next song.    Get Together: The beginning sounds like Time After Time by Cyndi Lauper. She sings \\""Can we get together I really want to be with you\\"" The songs gets a little fast toward the middle with again amazing 80's sounds blended in while she is singing. It ends the same way it beginns.     Sorry: She says Sorry in 5 different languages and you  hear in the background \\""I heard it all before\\"" repeated numerous times with each time it gets louder and she sings \\""I don't want to hear, I dont want to know, please dont say your sorry\\"". She also sings \\""don't explain yourself cause talk is cheap\\"" great words. Towards the end she sings forgive in a few different languages then in English. This is one of my favorite tracks and is supposed the second single.    Future Lovers: Very different sound from the whole album. This one was produced by Mirwais Ahmadzai who is credited for producing her Music and American Life album. She sings this songs in a very seductive voice and sings \\""would you like to try and come with me\\"". She sings \\""give me evidence of this brilliance\\"" referring to the love. This has a futuristic disco feel to it and the synthesizers they use do wonders for this song. This is also very dancebale track and one of my favorites and I hope it becomes a single too. This type of sound puts you in a trance. The music goes into I love New York and you can hear a little of Ray Of Light while blends into the next tune.     I Love New York:My favorite track. This is by far the most danceable track on this album. The beats are very intense and has a rock feel to it. This song is brilliant. The lyrics are funny. Madonna sings \\"" I don't like cities but I like New York other places make me feel like a dork\\"" At the end you hear cop sirens going off. She sings this song with an attitude and near the end she sings \\"" get off of my street\\"" several times, its just great!!    Let It Will Be: Oddly titled track beginns with the violin and is very similar to the beginning of Papa Don't Preach from the True Blue album. She sings about success and fame. The chorus part is great and I love this song.    Forbidden Love: This is the slowest track on the album but is not a ballad. This title can also be found on Madonna's Bedtime Stories Album but this one is a lot better. The vocoder is used and she sings \\""forbidden love are we supposed to be together\\"" and then sings it without the vocoder. This song is also very emotional and sad. The ending ends with numbers being count backwards from 5 and during each one a love line is said. This is just a beautiful song. This songs slowly blends into Jump. The way is blends is is pure genious.    Jump: Starts extacly like the beginning of West End Girls by the Pet Shop Boys. This is just a fun song and she sings \\""Are you Ready to jump, just take my hand get ready to jump.  When she sings these lines you seriously want to get up and jump. She also sings \\""I work and I fight till I find a place of my own\\"" referring back to her early years in the 80's.    How High: The vocoder is used again and it has a robotic sound to it in the beginning. Madonna sings and questions her fame again as she did in Let It Will Be and sings\\"" was it all worth it\\"" and \\""should I carry on will it matter when I'm gone\\"". This song has grown on me a lot and has a great beat to it.  It was also produced by Mirwais and Bloodshy and Avant.    Issac: A masterpiece by itself. It starts of like similar to sounds youwould hear in a lullaby story and then you hear a rabbi's chanting in the back. This song is obviously Kabbalah related. Madonna sings \\""wrestle with your darkness angels call your name can you hear what they are saying will you ever be the same\\"" then you hear the chorus and the chanting again then she sings other versus and the chanting and the chorus follows through again. This songs usues quite a few sounds mixed in well expecially towards the end. There is a pounding sound an a few times near the end it's amazing then the chorus. It ends with a man talking.I find this song brilliant and hope it becomes a single. This track is the longest track a little more than 6 minutes, its brilliant though.    Push: Another genious pop blend from Issac. This song has a good hip hop feeling to it and if you listen to it it does have a little rap in it. Madonna sings \\""You push me\\"" then in a hip hop rap fashion sings\\"" to go the extra mile\\"" and \\""when it's difficult to smile\\"". This song she sings to her husband Guy Ritchie. The chorus is the best part and has such a happy feeling to it and is similar to \\""Don't Tell Me\\"" from her Music Album.    Like It Or Not:  A nice song to end this brilliant album. She sings \\""this is who I am you can like it or not you can love me or leave cause I'm never gonna stop\\"". This song is mid tempo and not really fast. It ends beautifully with the guitars. Overall I give this album an A+. I dont skip any song. I would highly recommend it if you really want to dance hard!! Also don't forget to check out Madonna's American Life album a very underrated album indeed!"
610,4,"Bobby is fiiine. He may be the sexiest man in the R&B industry right now. His voice is sexy and his accent is even more cute. Although, he may need to hire a new song writer. His beats are all the same. I LOVE YOU BOBBY.   <br /> <br />Holla at ya girl, budafly"

612,5,"Storm and Her Dirty Mouth was an amazing performance experience and telling your friends you own this CD will be a claim to fame for decades, even now when the band is \\""retired\\"". In their hey-day I went to 6 of their concerts here in the Pac North West and every single occasion was simply the MOST energetic and raw awesomeness that I've ever experienced of the hundreds of concerts I've been to, rivaling even my first Pearl Jam experience.<br /><br />Geoff (the guitarist) went in a different direction about a year after this album came out and I was very worried that the music would suffer.  Of course, it would never be the same without Geoff, but the sheer talent of the lead singer kept the music rocking for another year or two of amazing concerts and a sophomore effort.  Storm Large (yup, that's her real birth-given name) has an amazing ability to tap directly into your primal core, to twist your adrenal glands and to make you a part of the music experience that is 100% energy.<br /><br />This EP is a perfect culmination of the post-Grunge/Seattle-Sound; a growth beyond melancholy moodiness but retaining the flavor of angst and social distortion.  Storm's voice is as beautiful as Sade's, with as much edge and energy as Henry Rollins, and as mind tripping as Maynard.  I'm reminded of 4 Non Blonds, Concrete Blond, and even some Nina Samone when listening to this album, but better, more \\""alive\\"", more \\""preadatory\\"".  Every song on this album is amazing and each shows a different talent of this band: however if pressed for favorites then \\""Ima Yora\\"" and \\""Crazy Love\\"" define everything I love about this band.<br /><br />Some will think it's silly to spend so much time raving about the greatness of a band that is no longer around, but this is definitely an album that should NOT be lost to faded memory.  Buy the album and write out your Will to ensure that this piece of history will be passed on as a cherished family heirloom.<br /><br />(FYI, Storm and her Dirty Mouth became Storm, Inc., which had a bitter dispute with the record label so Storm left the bay area of Cali and formed a band out of Portland called \\""The Balls\\"" with ex-members of Everclear and Motherlode and put out another album \\""Hanging with the Balls\\"" in 2003 and if you're lucky and in the area you might catch her at Dante's in Portland Oregon).uth became Storm, Inc., which had a bitter dispute with the record label so Storm left the bay area of Cali and formed a band out of Portland called \\""The Balls\\"" with ex-members of Everclear and Motherlode and put out another album \\""Hanging with the Balls\\"" in 2003 and if you're lucky and in the area you might catch her at Dante's in Portland Oregon)."
613,5,"What a blend of vocal music genres with astonishing sounds from four men from four countries singing in different languages!  <br /> <br />For regular listeners of classical vocal music who tend to be musically conservative, this will open your eyes and ears. The men of \\""Il Divo\\"" are, without a doubt, properly trained singers in the classical genres. The quartet applys their trained vocal techniques to certain \\""pop\\"" sounding passages -- their imitation of \\""pop-ish\\"" lyricism rivals any singers in the music industry. I my opinion, they are arguably better singers than most \\""pop\\"" singers whose popularity is supported only by marketing without a true product of talent.  <br /> <br />For those listeners whose ears are used to popular commercial vocal music, this album will sound strictly \\""classical\\"" or \\""operatic\\"" to you. If you refuse listening to operatic vocal music, this album is not for you -- it may be your subsitutute of sleeping medication. However, if you are musically curious, this is a very interesting album to have -- the sound of \\""Il Divo\\"" may change your mind about \\""old school\\"" music.  <br /> <br />Enjoy the sea of beautiful harmonic sound of \\""Il Divo\\""!"
614,2,"The titles included in this CD are indeed a good representation of Grace Jones's work. The 'remastering', however, is not. <br /> <br />Every single track on this compilation has been reworked to dull down Grace's raw, edgy power. It's as though a roomful of suit-and-tie record executives lifted Grace's vocals and laid them across Lawrence Welk arrangements, the result being that everything that makes Grace Jones blow your mind has been comfortably pasteurized for the coffeetable chitchat set.  <br /> <br />God forbid Grace should make anyone uncomfortable, or challenge their perceptions in any way. No, let's just turn down the volume and put a nice, safe audio bow on her. <br /> <br />Save your money, buy the original recordings, and pull up to the bumper, baby."
615,2,"I just don't get it. What's so good about this album? Alright, the first three songs were really good. Her best song is Behind These Hazel Eyes, I think. But what's happened to her voice at the rest of the album? Because of You sounds like the best of Mariah Carey meets Evanescence, actually more like the worst. Everything just starts going downhill from then on. Where's the Kelly who impressed me with her ballads during her 'Miss Independant' days. I think she's just trying to hard to revive her (almost) flagging career. (Did you know that she was nearly dropped by her record company?) Riding high on the pop-rock genre that has been shot to fame because of Avril Lavigne, Kelly proves that she's just a sell-out who will use absolutely anything to be heard on the radio, including changing her image into...a vamp! I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
616,5,"Finally! Many years ago I owned the vinyl of this recording. (Heaven knows where it got to!) I have been searching for this for years, as it is to my way of thinking, the archtypical collection of west coast jazz. John Mandell's arrangements serve as a terrific vehicle for some of the best inspired solos ever recorded. Touff and Kamuka along with Harry \\""Sweets\\"" Edison have never been better. A truly remarkable album. Sadly, out of print. Any west coast jazz buff needs to buy it before it truly disappears forever!"
617,5,"I have many different versions of the 1812 overture, Francesca Da Rimini, Romeo & Juliet, and Capriccio Italien. This version is one of my favorites; it only gets better with repeated listenings.  The Francesca Da Rimini is played somewhat expansively and slightly slower tempoed in the beginning, but it builds up to an exciting climax.  The playing by the IPO is outstanding and full of excitement, vibrancy, and power. The slower movements (such as the lovers theme) are very moving. Romeo & Juliet, 1812 Overture (with realistic cannon), and Capriccio are also excellent.  I really enjoy Bernstein's interpretation & conducting and the great full-bodied sound of the IPO.  The sound quality is great.     Bernstein's version of the 1812 Overture, Francesca da Rimini, and Romeo & Juliet compares well with other excellent versions (Antal Dorati, Sian Edwards, Adrian Leaper, to name a few), which I also own.  You may also want to check out the 1812 by Bernstein with New York Philharmonic which is coupled with Romeo & Juliet, Marche Slav, and Hamlet overture. Other great versions of the Francesca da Rimini are done by L. Stokowsky, Sian Edwards, and Riccardo Muti. I highly recommend this CD!!"
618,4,"Those put off by albums recorded in languages other than English should relax--and the best way to relax is to listen to this accessible, upbeat, and almost groovy album by the Japanese group Pizzicato Five. Leaders in the shibuya-kei movement, P5 demonstrates their consistent skill in songs like \\""Wild Strawberries\\"" and personal favorite \\""Room Service.\\"""
619,5,"If you consider yourself a fan of electronic music at all, you probably already own this... and if you don't you should slap yourself and immediately run out and buy it. This is one of the albums that defined and expanded the potential of IDM music. Many people consider this to be Aphex Twin's greatest work, and I wouldn't disagree.<br /><br />The drums don't just drum, they explode and morph in ways that sound so natural (and almost acoustic) that it's somewhat baffling. The frantic beats somehow manage to stay soothing throughout, which is quite a feat when you consider how intense and impressive they are. The melodies are clear, beautiful, and almost catchy... with something signature and nostalgically familiar about them that you'd swear you'd heard them before.<br /><br />Though there's a good chance that you have. 4 and To Cure a Weakling Child have already been established as classic pieces of electronic music wizardry.<br /><br />Few electronic musicians have come anywhere near to expressing the kind of complex personality that runs through The Richard D. James Album . To call this album a benchmark would be an understatement, but it would be hard to find the words to explain just how revolutionary and perfect this album is.<br /><br />Absolutely required."

621,5,"I am a long-time Buffet fan.  Volcano is, by far, my favorite album.  We spend many hours on our pontoon boat, slowly following the lakeshore.

622,5,"Ani Difranco is not known for hit singles; she is the definition of an \\""album artist.\\"" Nevertheless, while \\""Angry Anymore,\\"" which stems from her critically maligned 1999 \\""Up Up Up Up Up Up\\"" album, sounds far from ever being a song that was radio bound, it was chosen to be lifted from the album as a single. It is thus the only CD single by Difranco that has ever been commercially released.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this release was only made available in the UK, and thus the 2 excellent remixes of \\""Angry Anymore\\"" that are exclusive to this disc have not seen the recognition they deserve amidst Difranco's catalogue; they would have been perfect augmentations for the \\""Swing Set\\"" EP.<br /><br />Still, while they may be little-known remixes from 1999, they are still essential for all admirers of Difranco's work to obtain. While the LP version of the track is sonically bland and uneventful; only a lyrical highlight on the \\""Up Up Up Up Up Up\\"" album, the \\""Radio Mix Up\\"" and \\""Extendo Mix\\"" of the track do wonders to clear it up.<br /><br />Although it has more of a pop, radio-friendly arrangement, the \\""Radio Mix Up\\"" lets Difranco's lyrics, which reflect the feeling of what it is to come of age and thus understand your parents better than you ever could as a young child, come to the forefront even better than the original mix did. The production shimmers and sparkles with an insistent banjo keeping the pace of the song; essentially livening things up like a warm, soothing shot of espresso.<br /><br />The \\""Extendo Mix\\"" follows the same recipe, except it clocks out at over 2 minutes more the length. Although this too is a fine mix, it meanders a little bit unnecessarily, making the \\""Radio Mix Up\\"" overall the best mix of the track.<br /><br />The tracklisting is as follows:<br /><br />1. Radio Mix Up (3:14)<br />2. LP Version (3:27)<br />3. Extendo Mix (5:21)"
623,5,"I have to say, i love this CD very much, my boyfriend got me into the song (now ex boyfriend), \\""Making Memories of us\\"" which we have now made our song and after that i just started to fall in love with his voice, this is a must have to any collection. you will be glad you did get it."

625,4,Ingrid is amazing trumpet player no doubt. She has mastered trumpet playing (that too jazz) like no one else. Last person that remind me of such perfection and speed is Dizzy Gillespie.<br /><br />Yes not even Mile davis.<br /><br />But that is where comparison ends. Miles was genius cause he tried so many new things with his music that makes him a school in his own right.<br /><br />Ingrid is very much influenced with Miles (and she plays ome of the be-Bop stuff from miles here too). But just being influenced doesn't mean that you got the right pulse. She lacks ability to imptrovise like miles. She lacks knowledge of co ordinating electric instruments like synthesizers. And ofcourse she has long way to go with using wah wah paddle. Just hoping that she will be out of classic jazz soon and make her own path.

HELL NO!! this cd  only shows a bit of this bands depth. they, and many fans, will say this cd was weak or \\""experimental\\"". but its just cleaner production and a ballad or 2. i was kinda disappointed to see them totally switch directions on their next cds to please the so called \\""fan base\\"" who i doubt are listening or taking the time to write!! What this cd is is a classic.

628,3,"I, myself, thought the movie was quite fun to watch. It wasn't boring, and the activities never seemed to stop. The songs did add a lot to the movie.

629,5,"I hate that I only found out about Death Cab for Cutie last summer (2004). I wish I had been with them album to album to see how they grew, and eventually cumulated this masterpiece.  I am only slightly obsessed with this album. Every song is so good that I find it impossible for me to push 'next' on my stereo. Seriously, even though I have my favorites (lack of color, title & registration, we looked like giants), every time I put in this disc, I end up listening to the whole thing. If you have seen any of my reviews, focus is a big issue for me in an album. You can't get more focused than \\""Transatlanticism\\"". Each song ties together perfectly and, as noted by many others, sends a clear message of distance, yet avoids being repetitive in the slightest.  By the way my first impression of this CD was that it was pleasant, but sort of boring. I have made a complete change to declare that this CD deserves no less than 5 stars."
630,4,"Royksopp's first release, \\""Melody AM\\"" won lots of fans for its marriage of dancefloor fillers and tunes to sit quietly and listen.  Lots of lushness, lots of glitchy beats, and vocals that sounded alternately warm and cold...you'll get a lot of that on the new LP, \\""The Understanding\\"", too, but it comes in a harder form. <br /> <br />   After a crescendoing introduction, the first single \\""Only This Moment\\"" features lovely female vocals complimenting our duo's reflections on the fragile state of love. It's fast, frantic, and analog-sounding.  Next up is \\""49 Percent\\"", an amazing track which begins with a skittering beat and whispered vocals before building to something uplifting. Fans of the group Air will enjoy the soft jazzy sounds of \\""Beautiful Day Without You\\"", and dance enthusiasts will enjoy \\""Circuit Breaker\\"" and \\""Alpha Male\\"", both of which are heavier than most of \\""Melody AM\\"".    Since the atmosphere of isolation and dread was so key to the composition of \\""Melody AM\\"", some people might find this record more fractured and \\""pop\\"", especially since there are a number of vocal tracks.  But this is a grower...listen a few times and you'll stop comparing to the predescessor and appreciate the depth of emotion and technology of \\""The Understanding\\""!"
631,5,"I'm a huge JT fan, and have been for many years! Stormwatch is one of my favorite TULL albums. Ian Anderson is truley one of the greatest songwriter/muscians of all time and in my opinion everything Jethro Tull has ever done, has been off the hook!!!! When I heard Stormwatch for the first time it blew me away.. It's hard for me, but it probably is my favorite JT album!  Dark Ages, Home, Dun Ringill, Warm Sporran are all classics, but the Flying Dutchman is One of the Greatest Tull songs EVER!!!! ...And so is Stormwatch; ONE of GREATEST!!!!         This cd is a MUST have!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
632,4,"I really liked this CD. The lead vocalist used to live a house behind me and we were good friends and still are, so I got the CD free :-P. I recommend any one that like ska to buy this CD, But if your not in the genre you might not like this CD."
633,5,These are some talented brotheres...and the album proves the point!! no need to say more.
634,2,"To start this off, every member of this band knows how to play their instruments quite well despite their age, but there's a difference between being able to rip on your axe, and being able to do it with style. And they don't seem to realize that. When i opened up the case and pulled the cd out, i noticed a picture of the band as a whole, each sporting a t-shirt of the bands they idolize, one of them had the cover art for Overkill's classic album \\""Under the Influence\\"", another had a metallica shirt on, another had a Gn'R, when i saw that i thought allright, atleast these guys know what good music is... little did i know i was in for 55 minutes of third rate megadeth, metallica, overkill, testament, and killswitch engage rip off's, and we can thank Shadows Fall for breaking the new ground for all the wannabe Dave Mustaines across America, atleast Shadows Fall write unoriginal songs that are actually good. There was one solo on this disk where the guitarist took the last solo from the classic Megadeth song \\""Ashes in your Mouth\\"" pretty much note for note for about ten seconds, and another thing, am i the only one who thinks that alot of this album sounds like an uninspired attempt to recreate Under the Influence? And most of the solos, while damn hard to play, are flat out directionless, boring and non-creative. it's kind of funny that bands like Offspring who aren't known for their technicality have written better solos... another thing i don't get is the fact that they listen to the right bands with the right guitarists who write really classy solos, but these guys simply don't have it. Now that the negatives are out of the way, this cd does have some tracks worth checking out, \\""A Gunshot to the Head of Trepidation\\"" is really the highlight of the album, it's got a damn nice breakdown in the middle of the song that caught me off guard. I'd recommend this band to anybody who likes the screamo-emo singers with guitarists that play techinical music that's not any good, any fan of Avenged Sevenfold would love this. However, any fan of Megadeth or Testament, do yourself a favor and save 15 bucks and go get a cd from a new band who knows what they're doing, such as God Forbid's \\""Gone Forever\\"", or hell, even AFI. Stay away from this one."
635,4,i like this album very much though i don't speak french or i don't even understand a word of it.i could always clam myself down whenever i hear it.
636,4,"on 2 cd's, more or less performed \\""live\\"", if you can consider this live, as all the sound sources are digital, it would seem. The only improvisation I can see happening here is in the sound mix itself, and without any details as to mixing and production, nothing concrete can be assumed. As is standard with Kraftwerk releases, the inner sleeve is minimal, at best, offering only songwriting credits and  photos showing the stage set up, the band members and a few audience members' heads. The outer cardboard sleeve at least shows  the dates and cities of the performances for each song. Nothing more than that. But I am to assume it is the music that is of most importance here. Most of these live performances don't stray too far from the originals, and the ones that do don't go too far from the arrangements found on the Mix, the Kraftwerk cd from 1991 or so. They are a little more punchy sounding, a little louder, more modern. Bottom line: this is a nice introduction to Kraftwerk for those looking for a greatest hits type set. I'm not so sure the \\""double live\\"" aspect is of any importance - I for one would never have expected to see such a conventional \\""rock n roll\\"" gesture from a band like Kraftwerk, who have managed to buck tradition for so long. But it is a nice package for fans,  collectors and completeists, as this is the only commercially available live album from these pioneers of electronic music."
637,1,"These recordings are not re-mastered Scot Joplin works but rather \\""piano rolls\\""  and as such are very mechanical sounding.At no place on the catalog info does the words\\""piano roll\\"" appear and therefor this album is a swindle.  Tin Ear"
638,5,"Roxette is one of those groups that deservedly get lots of airplay, with their infectious hooks and catchy pop songs.  It's a safe bet that you know most of their hit singles, even if you don't know the songs by name or who sings them.<br /><br />The chameleon of pop music, Roxette's music infiltrates your sub-conscious, and whenever there's a familiar pop song buzzing around in your head, and you just can't place it, it's probably them.<br /><br />The US version of this album from Amazon.com lists 15 songs, and notes below that there are four bonus tracks.  The UK album available on Amazon UK only lists 11 songs, but I can't be sure if this is a typo or if it's missing a few tracks.<br /><br />Roxette is made up of guitarist Per Gessie and vocalist Marie Fredriksson, who came together in the late eighties to make beautiful music together.  Many albums and hit singles later, they're still with us, and even though this is a 1993 album, it still sounds as perky as ever.<br /><br />For pop entertainment how can you beat lyrics such as:<br /><br />\\""Walking like a man, hitting like a hammer, she's a juvenile scam, never was a quitter, tasty like a raindrop, she's got the look.\\""<br /><br />Trust me, you know more than 75% of the songs on this album, and after this crash course in Roxette 101, you won't forget them again.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, May 26, 2005"
639,5,"Tori Amos is a very tallented muisician, lyricist and vocalist.  This is a very interesting compilation and she has catalogued the tracks according to the Dewey decimal system which is a blast since I went to library school and I have therefore used this system at work and during my studies. Amos writes some really good lyrics, but sometimes they go on and on and an editor could have been needed to make them less meandering. Even so they are quite well written and Amos is a very inteligent and beautifull woman. I love the book-let and the photos are state of the art photography and the idea to catalogue the tracks according to the dewey system is a stroke of genius. I love it that she has listed all the musicians and the instruments that they played on her records. This is a very good compilation of her many good and varied tracks."
640,3,"Let's be honest here, any review of  this album is going to view it in light of \\""Hounds of Love\\"", the album it followed.  And in many ways, thats likely an unfair record to compare anything to, being as it is probably Bush's masterpiece.  Having stated that though, this album should have had an easier time standing up to it, but it has a few flaws, not the least of which being a sort of muddy sound, this causes the separation between the vocals and instrumentation to sometimes not work well, and some songs (\\""The Sensual World\\"", \\""Never Be Mine\\"") have parts of their vocal partially obscured by the backing.  Bush also developed an odd, wide vibrato vocal technique she uses on a few songs that somewhat gets in the way of the piece.    Now mind you, there's nothing that can stop the wonder and amazement of \\""This Woman's Work\\"".  Likely the best song in Bush's entire catalog, it is a piece of delicate and amazing beauty, of jaw-dropping instensity, with a slightly overblown orchestra arrangement from Michael Kamen that somehow works flawlessly, it is a piece of delicate and amazing beauty that begs for hearing.    Other standouts on the album include the amazing \\""Rocket's Tail\\"", featuring a breathtaking a capella intro (by Bush and the Trio Bulgarka) before evaporating into a stunning guitar solo (courtesy of Pink Floyd's David Gilmour) and the funky, albiet somewhat poorly realized \\""Heads We're Dancing\\"" (featuring monster bass playing from Mick Karn).  And a couple tracks (\\""The Sensual World\\"", \\""Deeper Understanding\\"", \\""Never Be Mine\\"") are decent enough.  Still, there's a bit too much unengaging material (\\""Love and Anger\\"", \\""Reaching Out\\"") to let this album reach to the heights of previous work.    \\""This Woman's Work\\"" really is worth the price of the album alone, but this is far from the best of Bush's work."

643,5,"From the moment I heard \\""This Love\\"", I knew Maroon 5 was a great band.  I don't know if it was the captivating lead vocals of Adam Levine, or the funky, driving bass line of the track.  More fascinating is the entire album, Songs About Jane.  True, Maroon 5 has deep, real lyrics full of emotional substance and intent, but the one thing that stands out on this album is the mix of soul, R&B, and good 'ol rock and roll.    Maroon 5 possess the soulful vocals, harmonies and hooks that make R&B songs chart-toppers; the crying, seductive guitar lines and steady, powerful percussion of rock music; and that grooving bass of classic funk and soul.  That not only makes them an effectively eclectic band, but also deems them capable of COMBINING all these much loved styles together.  Songs like the breathless \\""She Will Be Loved\\"" elude a dramatic, rock love ballad, while others like the upbeat, swingy, bassy \\""Sunday Morning\\"" and \\""Through With You\\"" possess R&B-like vocals that sweeten up a hard-driving percussion line.  A lot of the songs border on Matchbox 20 and Train in their post-relationship content and falsetto, yet gentle lead vocals (...respectively, needless to say...), like \\""Shiver\\"" and \\""Tangled\\"", but unlike those attention-aging bands, Maroon 5 excels at joining R&B, funk, pop, soul, and rock in meaningful, addictive songs, which evidently is in demand in the new millenium.  And their candid, unplanned, non-traditional style?? -- that's the essence of the new millenium, for those that haven't realized it!"
644,4,"It is sad that the family of Japanese composer Hisato Ohzawa (1907-1953) had to, against the tides of fortune, preserve the scores of his works after his music dropped completely from sight after his death, and we are fortunate that the family preserved them so carefully for these two pieces are really worthwhile. After his death he became so obscure that he was not even remembered by very many in the Japanese music scene. He had been in the first generation of Japanese composers to study in the West and unlike many had spent several years in the US studying with the likes of Frederick Converse, Roger Sessions and Arnold Schoenberg. While in the US he was the first Japanese to conduct the Boston Symphony (in his own 'Little Symphony') before he went on to study with Nadia Boulanger in Paris. After six years in the West he returned to Japan and remained there the rest of his life. He led an active life in the Kansei district (which includes his hometown, Kobe, as well as Osaka and Kyoto). But that was a conservative part of the country and his music had difficulty being accepted (although to our ears they are extremely easy to assimilate); he was not helped by the rudimentary state of Japanese orchestras in those days.<br /><br />His Third Piano Concerto has elements reminiscent of Rachmaninoff, Bart'&oacute;k and Ravel (with more than a soupç'on of jazzy Gershwin thrown in). The outer movements are virtuosic, rhythmically interesting, and brilliantly orchestrated. Their harmonic language is French cum Russian, their thrust Bart&oacute;'kian. The middle movement, which begins with a smoky sax blues, surely was modeled to some degree on the second movement of Ravel's G Major Concerto with some cross-fertilization from Gershwin's Concerto in F. It is simply gorgeous. The performance here by Russian pianist Ekaterina Saranceva is sparkling and she is ably accompanied by the Russian Philharmonic under the up-and-coming Dmitry Yablonsky, also known to us as a fine cellist. The Concerto's subtitle, 'Kamikaze,' has little to do with the Japanese suicide bombers of World War II; written in 1938 (and subtitled at least partly to give the concerto a popular tinge) it is named after the civil airplane called the 'Kamikaze,' a feat of pre-war Japanese engineering that set a speed record between Tokyo and London and of which the nation was understandably proud.<br /><br />The Third Symphony, written just before the Second Concerto, was premi'red in 1937 by the forerunner of the NHK Symphony to an indifferent response from the Tokyo public. It is subtitled 'Symphony of the Founding of Japan' to celebrate the 2600th anniversary of the country. (Richard Strauss and Benjamin Britten. among others, also wrote pieces for the celebration.) In four movements, the first and longest movement is a dramatic, even brutalist, sonata-allegro which sounds a bit like Honegger with lots of pentatonic scale passages thrown in. The second movement, Adagio grazioso, is a bit misterioso, features much that sounds like French non-impressionist music (Roussel, Honegger) wedded with ceremonial Gagaku (Japanese court) music. Although mostly serene, there are some uneasy undercurrents. The charming third movement, Menuet con fantasia, is in rondo form (not the usual ABA minuet form), one section of which 'uses a bouncing pattern, called Pynkobushi' (I am indebted here to the detailed insert notes by Japanese musicologist and critic Morihide Katayama). The finale, Allegro non troppo con fuoco, bursts onto the scene with a fortissimo tutti clamor and then settles into a march rhythm until the Pynkobushi rhythm of the previous movement returns to lighten the atmosphere a bit. Another sonata-allegro (albeit rather free), this movement, with its contrasting first and second themes, subsides into a string chorale before leading to a complex and fascinating contrapuntal recombination of the original themes. Quite a feat of expert craft leading to fascinating and musicallysatisfying results. This work grew on me each time I heard it. If one makes some allowance for its emotional reticence (surely a carry-over of Ohzawa's French training), it is very nearly the equal of most of what was being written in Europe at the time.<br /><br />Recommended for those wishing to stray from the tried and true.<br /><br />TT=64:10<br /><br />Scott Morrisonatisfying results.

645,3,"Matt Dusk is a good singer with a voice that has a neutral effect on you. It is not the type of talent that gives you goose bumps. Some of the reviewers do not have musically-tuned ears to make a judgment about his talent. If you want to hear music that makes you say \\""WOW!\\"" at the end of every song, you can simply listen to the real thing: Sinatra that is!"
646,4,"Nguyen Le has turned in another ruminative consideration of the spiritual quality of life, this time ably assisted by Paul McCandless and others, inspired by his own close call with cancer. As he has done in works ranging from the Hendrix tribute Colour of Purple to his mystical Tales From Viet Nam, and in all his work with his partner Huong Thanh from Moon and Wind through Dragonfly to Mangustao, he has given the guitar a unique voice. No easy task. That voice speaks like the writinigs of Thich Naht Hanh, and seeks to utter that quiet space where what is most fundamentally true remains silent. In considering this paradox, Le articulates in lines more Viet Namese and Buddhist than anything in the Western tradition of Jazz, save perhaps where Coltrane was beginning to go at the end of his life. <br />Add McCandless and his soulful oboe and reed work, which seemed to first catch my ears in the Paul Winter Consort's epochal ICARUS, and you have a contemplation of critical moments in life that re-direct your intentionality. This is brilliant music."
647,2,"I was very excited to get this album after having Dead Disco in my playlist for a long time, and hearing a great live version of Calculation Theme on SomaFM.  After listening to the album for a while, those are still the only two songs that I like on the album. <br /> <br />Metric's problem on this album is that a lot of the songs are indistinguishable from one another, and they can't decide whether to be Interpol-style trashy nihilists or earnest anti-war rockers-with-a-conscience.  However, those sins can be forgiven in the presence of great songs, but tracks like IOU, Succexxy and Combat Baby tend to blend together in an uninteresting mush. <br /> <br />Part of my problem with this album was that I was listening to it after Funeral by The Arcade Fire, which is a very cohesive and powerful album, making Old World Underground pale in comparison."
648,5,"This is not only the most complete of the Eddie Fisher cds available, but it's got great sound quality as well.  All of Eddie's hits are here -- and there isn't a bad song in the bunch.<br /><br />EVERYBODY'S GOT A HOME BUT ME was a real surprise, as it was among those I'd never heard before (Eddie Fisher was a bit before my time) and quickly became one of my all-time favorites.  It's a very vivid narrative of a man traveling across America on a bus ...<br /><br />I guess the greatest testimonial I can give this album is to say that Eddie Fisher moved up significantly higher on my list of all-time favorite artists the minute I heard this album."
649,5,"Misfits fans tend to be divided on this album, especially since the release of Static Age. More than half of these tracks date back to the original Static Age sessions and were not released prior to this album, albeit with slightly different instrument tracks and mixes. (After the band split Danzig went back with Eerie Von and re-recorded alot of the instrument tracks, the result being a big, full-sounding heavy drum and guitar sound, with almost zero bass and  big, reverb drenched vocal tracks). Most fans tend to favor the newer Static Age LP versions, with a more punkish production (ie: punchy bass and a tight compact copressed tone). I like both versions but I REALLY love the LOB mixes, they sound much cleaner and LOUDER, and Glenn's vocals come out much more clear and refined than they do on SA, which, to me, sounds more amateurish and dated.<br /><br />Even if you prefer the ST Age versions you cannot pass on this LP, the version of Halloween on this album tops all other versions available and it also contains what I feel to be the Misfits greatest song \\""American Nightmare\\"" (one Glenn claims was recorded during the Walk Among Us Sessions), truly indispensible.<br /><br />This album also appears in its entirity (tho scattered here and there) on the Coffin Box Set, but if you're putting that one off, you could do alot worse by not getting this. It, to me, is a much better choice than Collection 1 or 2; but everyone seems to disagree with me on that. They can all burn in hell, this album is one of the best."
650,5,"with this massive album,skunk anansie has created a spot for itself, although there are dominant songs like \\""hedonism\\"" or \\""brazen\\"" each title preserves it's authenticity strongly marked by skins input. Her voice is a label on this album, but still highlights and goes very well with the instrumentals. Unlike many rock albums this one does not struggle to overcome many of the cliches, some just cannot override, because we see here a powerful combination of songwriting, instrumentals, and voice display without any excess. Still excess runs as a virtue on this album, there is always a peak, an outrage, that is uncontrollable, that renders a catarchtic moment to it, that separates it from the category of easy listening, especially that the band is at it's best...it is worth trying it out."
651,4,"Stigmata was one great movie, it was casted well, directed stunningly and dealed with a deep subject with due credit. It is one of the best movies I have seen related to the subject of the church and good vs evil. Whilst browsing my favourite DVD/CD shop I came across the movie sountrack and decided to opt to buy it and am glad I did.<br /><br />Contrary to several people's complaints that the music from the movie was not on the sountrack, that is not correct, watching the movie before listening to the soundtrack, I did pick up 95% of the songs and the music sounds. What is most exciting about this album is that it incorporates music songs as well as music sounds that were played throughout the movie. Nearly all the tracks were supreme and yet at the end I did want to play it again. The Reflect pieces throughout the music tracks were mixed to create a mood of reflection within the innerself.<br /><br />Well done to the movie and the soundtrack. What a masterful masterpiece."
652,5,"The classic One for All was the answer to- \\""is hip-hop dying?\\"". Around the time, it didn't sell as much as what the West Coast had sold but definitely was a bigger seller than most of the platinum gangsta rap albums outselling it on a national level (as quoted by Alex Henderson). However, it was proven that this album stood as hip-hop's shiny, new light that would eventually open new doors for upcoming rappers at the time. <br /> <br />Wake Up was Puba's attempt to open the black community's minds to self-destructive issues such as drugs. While Wake Up opened the minds, their classic hit, Slow Down, reviewed the issues as to how it could destroy you. A rastafarian flavor, Who Can Get Busy Like this Man, established Puba of flippin' 'n floppin' rhymes, with a reggae beat. Fan quickly fell in love with the incredible flow of Sadat-X when he showed he was no one's shadow in Concerto in a X Minor. And if that wasn't enough for you, All for One claimed clubs and the whole underground with its pump gridin' production. <br /> <br />Personal favorite= Slow Down <br />Honorable mentions= All for One, Ragtime and Dance to my Ministry"

654,5,"This is not a continuation of the Eagles. This is the mature, full blown man, husband, father, & human being that Don Henley is today. There is some very good blues, several nice, slow love ballads, and a couple of nice rockin' tunes. Personally I loved \\""They're Not Here\\"" and especially \\""Miss Ghost\\"". The album shows Don Henley isn't limited to being a rocker. He can now be called an artist. Which means, of course, many won't like this album. His politics are evident, as always. But there's also heart and soul here. Too many are gonna listen to this and say \\""You've changed. I don't know you any more.\\"" Well, that's what life's about. And Henley's isn't about just the music. Although I think the music's pretty good. It's the whole package. For those of us old enough to have walked this road. We can relate this this music. But others aren't going to like it."
655,4,"In actual fact, Elements is a re-issue of an album the Sunz released in early 1999 called \\""The First Testament\\"". The reason why that album is unknown to fans is becaused it was released in very limited quantity. Elements, however, has about 2 or 3 additional tracks and sounds as raw as ever. The Sunz never dissapoint. The only thing left to do is for Shabazz The Disciple to join Sunz of Man once again as the 5th arch-angel and release a new album for 2005."
656,4,"When Mandy first came out back in '99, I honestly could not stand her. I was and am an admitted fan of the whole teen pop era that she was a part of, but hated her debut single \\""Candy\\"" and instantly dismissed her as a one hit wonder. However, despite the fact that Mandy came no where near her peers in popularity, her future works were very strong. Her self-titled 2001 release was a very cool, yet sophisticated contribution to teen pop and her 2003 covers album was even better, yet neither made much of a splash on the charts despite decent critical accalim and that's a shame. This \\""Best of\\"" takes some of her best *and worst* material from her four albums. None of these were huge hits....\\""I Wanna Be With You\\"" was Mandy's only top 40 hit \\""Candy\\"" just missed it peaking at #41, but these were not even remotely her best songs. <br /> <br />Her best song is probably \\""Only Hope.\\"" Even though it was never a radio hit, it is probably her most liked song. It's great to see it on here. \\""Cry\\"" is also a very strong single as is her covers of \\""I Feel the Earth Move\\"" and \\""Have A little Faith.\\"" i personally would've liked to see her version of \\""Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters\\"" on here, but oh well. Her lone top 40 hit \\""I Wanna Be With You\\"" is also nice.  <br /> <br />Mandy will probably never have a very big recording career, but she does have talent. She's come a long way from her first album \\""So Real.\\"" <br />"

I won't say that \\""Not Richard\\"" is as essential as must haves like \\""Eat Your Paisley\\"" and \\""Beelzebubba\\"", but it definitely would only improve your Dead Milkmen collection if you had it, hardcore fans should be delighted, unless they already have it, then they're probably already delighted.

659,5,"This CD features beautiful renditions of timeless Christmas classics. Tony Harrell and Peter Cetera provide great piano, guitar, and vocal arrangements. Some of the songs have almost Beatle-esque qualities (Let It Snow, Jingle Bells) while others have more classical stylings (Deck the Halls). The three original songs (You Just Gotta Love Christmas, Something That Santa Claus Left Behind, Alone for the Holidays) have definitive pop appeal. Good mix of upbeat and slow tempo tunes."

661,4,"As a depressed, immature, drug-addicted teenager, nothing spoke to me quite like the manipulative lyrics of \\""The Wall.\\""  As a happy, relatively mature, sober adult, they readily reveal themselves to be less profound than originally thought.  That being said, I have spent more money on this album and the film companion than any other single work of music (and this includes a recording of Berlioz's \\""Damnation of Faust\\"" on which I appear).  I have owned it on vinyl, cassette, CD (twice - after one copy was stolen from my car), and the film on VHS and DVD.   Why do I keep going back?  Two reasons: no matter how confused I think some of the lyrics are now, there is no denying the soul poured into them; and this album is undeniably an essential work in defining the (albeit flawed - much like this album) history of rock and roll in all its self-indulgent glory.   Students will be listening to this album 200 years from now (if we still exist on the planet), and despite our short-sighted present day society, that says something.  <br />  <br />OK - let's get to brass tacks.  Why will this album continue to be heard?  Grandeur.   While really only being the story of a boy who lost his father in WWII, then lost his soul to the excesses of rock and roll, lost his wife in that process, then, ultimately, lost his marbles, \\""The Wall\\"" sprays to all fields, touching on themes of fascism, the judicial system, and nuclear war.   It doesn't matter that a lot of these themes miss their targets, it was ambitious enough to try.   The songs are connected the way that the songs in any decent Broadway musical are: similar melodies, similar voices, similar endings.  Not a lot of rock musicians (people most comfortable with a 4/4 tempo and a tonic, fourth, fifth chord progression) could even come close to the cohesion present here.   <br /> <br />My personal favorite \\""song\\"" on this album has always been \\""Nobody Home\\"" - while not the melodic masterpiece that \\""Comfortably Numb\\"" is - \\""Nobody Home\\"" so accurately describes the general hopelessness of a drug induced depression both in lyric and in melody, that I find it somehow strangely comforting.  \\""And I got a strong urge to fly/But I got...nowhere to fly to\\"" - truer words have yet to be spoken about the funk that drugs can lead to.  I appreciate that Roger Waters wasn't just writing about drug use, but albums ultimately speak to the listener through their own personal experience, and that was my personal experience with the lyrics he wrote.     <br /> <br />As I have only given this album four stars, I must explain.  There are too many songs on this album that force me to hit fast forward.  \\""Nobody Home\\"" is followed by \\""Vera\\"" and \\""Bring the Boys Back Home\\"" which leads into \\""Comfortably Numb.\\""  Huh?  I appreciate breaking up a theme, but jeez, I thought we were done with the WWII talk on side 1 of this work.  Also, it galls me that one of the finest works in the film (and one of the songs that actually connects some themes) is left off the studio album.  \\""The Tigers Broke Free\\"" is a great piece of music, and more in tune to the concept of the album than \\""Bring the Boys Back Home\\"" ever could be.  I also (despite the fact that it is a really good song) find \\""Hey You\\"" an unnecessary element to the album.  It just doesn't fit.  \\""Master of the House\\"" is a great bit of theatre in \\""Les Miserables\\"" - but it is there ONLY to create a hit - and that's what \\""Hey You\\"" is.    <br /> <br />To sum up - this is an essential bit of music to own if you truly want to represent music in your collection, just be aware that no matter how great it seems, it fails on several levels.  Buy this album and decide for yourself.   <br />"
662,5,"I bought the Lim. Ed. DVD/CD set and got it today.<br /><br />I've listened to the CD twice and will many more!<br /><br />They balance their mostly unchanged signature sound with pop dance and ballads.<br /><br />Finally, a cd I want to buy and actually LIKE ALL THE TRACKS on it!

663,5,"In June of 2004, \\""Down Beat\\"" Magazine's Frank-John Hadley polled 73 of the top jazz singers in the world for a list of the 30 greatest vocal jazz albums of all time.  This one ended up #5.  I say, \\""Right on.\\""  This is truly one of the all-time greats.<br /><br />In fact, ironically, this one ended up higher than any of Billie Holiday's albums (\\""Billie Holiday on Commodore\\""--#8, in case you're interested.), and this is a Lady Day tribute.  But after a number of listens, I'm here to say--it's no accident.  The worlds' finest know what they're talking about.<br /><br />Carmen McRae swings like mad here, in a way that Lady Day never did.  She even swings the last chorus of \\""Yesterdays\\"", and \\""Trav'lin' Light\\"", two songs I've not heard swung before.  And the way she swings \\""Them There Eyes\\"", \\""I'm Gonna Lock My Heart (And Throw Away the Key)\\"", \\""Miss Brown To You\\"", \\""I Cried For You\\"" and \\""What a Little Moonlight Can Do\\"" will have you snapping your fingers and dancing around the room.  Terrific, terrific stuff--and Nat Adderley and Lockjaw Davis' solos on \\""Moonlight\\"" make this rival the immortal version of Lady Day's.<br /><br />But Lady Day was the tops for honest emotion, and Ms. McRae is every bit her equal here.  Carmen hits every color of anger, bitterness and resignation in \\""Strange Fruit\\"", as Lady Day did in the famous original.  Her handling of the phrase \\""They Don't Come 'Round No More\\"" in \\""God Bless the Child\\"" matches the world-weary disappointment in dependent false friends that Billie Holiday conveyed in the original.  And when Ms. McRae sings \\""Make Love to Me\\"" in \\""Lover Man (Oh, Where Can You be)\\"", there not only is no doubt about what she means, but you better drop what you're doing and get busy, Mister!!<br /><br />BTW, the 73 have Carmen's \\""Carmen Sings Monk\\"" at #4.  These two albums rank higher than any album cut by Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan or Miss Holiday.  After listening to this, I'm thinking that, as revered as she was, Carmen McRae was probably the most underrated jazz singer who ever lived.  RCably the most underrated jazz singer who ever lived.  RC <br /> <br />"
664,5,"I have been a huge fan of senses fail since i got their EP \\""from the depths of dreams\\"", although this Cd is very different from the EP it is still a very good CD. the lyrics are all very catchy and there isnt one song on the cd that I dont like."
665,4,I LOVE BELINDA CARLISLE. SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY FAVORITE  GO-GO. SHE COULD REALLY ROCK. I LIKE BELINDA'S VOICE SHE HAS A NICE SWEET VOICE!!!! MY FAVORITES ON HERE ARE HEAVEN IS A PLACE ON EARTH AND I GET WEAK. THIS IS A NICE ALBUM TO HAVE. IF YOU LIKED BELINDA WITH THE GO-GO'S THEN YOU WOULD DEFINITELY LIKE THIS ALBUM.
666,5,"In a era where boy bands and bad alt-rock reign, HypoFixx is a breath of fresh air. His Ministry and Skinny Puppy influences shine through without obscuring his originality and energy. The songs are dense without sounding overproduced and allow HypoFixx to stay true to his roots while breaking new ground. An essential addition to music's Industrial legacy."
667,5,"Acey is a truly amazing MC, a literate guy in general who's wordplay isn't just smart, it's practically poetic. <br /> <br />So, why would I review an album from 1995? Well, I just got it is excuse number one, and excuse number two is All Balls Don't Bounce was just reissued. An extra CD of videos and remixes is on it, and that's a nice accompaniment and no-cost add on to album. In general, the production is spacey. It's reminiscent of early DJ Shadow and present day 9th Wonder. That makes the fact that this is an underground hit even more surprising because of the fact that the sound and beats are pretty close to present day underground beats. The really resonating part of this album is Acey's flow. A.C. Alone floats, bounces, and riffs over the beats, at times almost as arhythmic as a beat poet, as jazzy as a bebop scatter, and as tight as an old-school speed rapper. While the sound of Aceyalone is recognizable almost instantly, the album stays fresh because he varies his flow and rhythm constantly, and the depth and intricate word play of his rhymes reinforces the diversity and eclecticism of the album. <br /> <br />Highlights are the comical, staggering \\""Analilia?\\"", the trippy \\""Mr. Outsider,\\"" thumping anthem \\""All Balls,\\"" old-school \\""Mic Check\\"", and hard sucker punch of \\""Arhythmaticulas.\\"" It's overall an album worth checking out and owning, especially with this extra CD of remixes and remastered production that comes with the 2004 reissue. Abstract Rude guest spots also enhance the experience, whether you're looking for trip-hop, old school, or tight underground work Acey's \\""All Balls Don't Bounce\\"" pack it all, and with some wicked string basslines. <br /> <br />Universal soldier he is.  <br />"
668,3,"Electro-rock trio Buffalo Daughter is one of the most brilliant electronica bands to surface in a long time. They are also apparently very fond of remixes. \\""Socks, Drugs and Rock and Roll\\"" features six remixes of their songs from their \\""Captain Vapour Athletes\\"" debut, with... um... some mixed results. (Sorry, I had to make that pun)<br /><br />The problem is that sometimes the remixes don't sound anything like Buffalo Daughter at all. The opener is the worst: \\""Dr. Moog [The Destroyer Remix]\\"" by Alec Empire. It's a beeping cacophonous mess that has lost most of Buffalo Daughter's musical cleverness, and is marred by distorted howls of \\""DEEESSSSTROOOOOOY!\\"" If that doesn't kill your appetite, nothing will.<br /><br />But don't give up. The slower \\""Daisy [Pushed Up]\\"" by Stock, Hausen & Walkman is a blessing by comparison -- it's not outstanding, but nice. Money Mark peaks the album with \\""Big Wednesday,\\"" a sweepingly odd remix with a languid, spacey tone. \\""Li303ve [Suzuki Dekard San]\\"" is a very good remix by U.N.K.L.E., a sort of otherworldly bounce sound. \\""Daisy [Talking Bird]\\"" by 25 Ton is a pleasant listen, if mildly repetitive, and the \\""Silver Turkey [Raise Your Chicken Mix]\\"" by Sugar is a eerie slice of guitar pop.<br /><br />With the exception of the opener, \\""Socks\\"" is a pretty decent remix album. None of the tracks resemble each other; at times it's hard to believe that before the mixing, they all came from the same band, same album. But taken individually, it has some excellent tracks, some decent ones, and one bad one.<br /><br />Alec Empire bombs with the Destroyer mix. I can only take so many frenzied, distorted yowls against a backdrop of percussion chaos. Money Mark and U.N.K.L.E., by comparison, add new dimensions by their reinterpretation -- they make it a bit richer and sweeter and sometimes more fun. They also don't demolish the electro-rock sound -- instead they give it an acid trip.<br /><br />Buffalo Daughter makes some truly excellent rock music, and some of the remixes by other artists are just as good. It's the wrong place to start experiencing Buffalo Daughter's music, but fans will love at least half of this EP.music, and some of the remixes by other artists are just as good.

669,1,"Bland-pop, with most liked songs being cover versions. <br />Buy the originals, because Miss Simpson simply doesn't do them any credit whatsoever. She oughta be jailed for the mutilation of Robbie Williams' 'Angels' <br /> <br />"
670,5,"As soon as I put this thing in my cd player and it started with the bassline and \\""back in the days when I was a teenager...\\"" I knew it was going to be awesome.  Q-Tip drops some of his best verses ever; I think his lyricism started declining an album or two later even as Phife kept getting better, but the Tribe is in a sweet spot here.  This album is sandwiched in between their infectious debut (which is as annoyingly revered as 3 Feet High and Rising) and their incredible three-peat Midnight Marauders, and has all the signs of a group riding a wave of effortless youthful mastery.  The beats are bouyant, the hooks are fun, the call and response is totally natural.  Just like Midnight Marauders, none of the songs really fall flat, and while I was under the impression that MM was the best tribe album, this one has the elusive mixture of brains and booty that this group has been trying to recapture ever since.  This is not a forceful rap album, but you still can't resist it, no matter who you are."
671,4,"the best thing about this album is that it's one of those undisputed classics you can get just about any place for a few bucks. jangle-pop doesn't get any better than this, neither does indie rock, for that matter. TF was a great band, and this is their best album...i am looking forward to snagging their new best of comp, _four thousand seven hundred and sixty seconds_. teenage fanclub was a band never graced with having goodlooking covers for their albums. _bandwagonesque_ is no different. just goes to show: don't judge a yadda yadda yadda... <br />"
672,5,"Ever have one of those days when nothing seems to be going well and you just feel like throwing all your toys out of your pram? <br /> <br />Well this is the kind of music you need. It will open your up your mind...transport you to another world...and ultimatley get you back on track. <br />  <br />Every good downtempo track or artist you can probably think of from the past year or so is represented here - Joss Stone, Turin Breaks, Ikon, Jack Johnson, Coldplay... <br /> <br />Defintely not your regular chillout album full of bland repetitive beats... <br /> <br />The first disc is more laidback than the first...a wonderful collection of blissed out beats beginning with Zero 7's Home which gently eases you into chill mode. The second disc however gives you the option of uping the tempo with a dancier mix of grooves aimed at progressively lifting your spirits. <br />  <br />By the time you've worked your way through both discs, you'll be well and ready take on the world again!  <br />  <br />A must buy if you're looking for an album to chill to...this is the ultimate in its class, an truly amazing mix of laidback house and blissful beats that make for the ultimate chill. <br />"
673,3,"yes it is yet another band that wastes the beauty of a 7 string. Poppy sounding, radio friendly CRAP that gets very old very fast. cool album art though. Travis Smith is a genius."
674,4,"Avril Lavigne's &quot;Under My Skin&quot;. Finally, a real teenage girl singing about what she truly feels in this day and age where most of the girls this age in the music business these days are superficial and fake. All the songs on here are showing real emotions and experiences. If that is fake, then I don't know what isn't. Although &quot;Let Go&quot; was good in its own way, &quot;Under My Skin&quot; is even better than that album. Without The Matrix, Avril has made the finest album around, doing what she really wanted to do, instead of being bogged down by their demands. The only flaw to this album was that it was a little too short for my taste, but all in all, this is a great album. Anyone tired of the oversexed teen-oriented dance-pop and wannabe singer-songwriters who only write what they think the public wants to hear should pick this up. She'll blow those other performers out of the water. And, just look at some of the subjects talked about in the songs: death (&quot;Slipped Away&quot;), abstinence (&quot;Don't Tell Me&quot;), being lost (&quot;Nobody's Home&quot;), relationships that were meant to be but were lost (&quot;My Happy Ending&quot;), and loneliness (&quot;How Does It Feel?&quot;). If you think these things are fake, then you've been missing out. Check this out and see what you've been missing all along."
675,5,"Weezy, congrats!! The uncrowned king of the rap game, seriously !!! Dawg , I wasn't a fan of the breakup, I still don't agree, but time changes ,so do people. You were the bigger  person to make a record about your feelings about your dawgs, instead of riding on the other Hot Boys, you kept it trill. Mannie you cut the buck on this beesh. Hot as fizzuck, the best Cash Money album of all time. A sure Grammy !! Weezy if you top this you one, I am going to campaign to call it Wayne's World . Man, I aint riding your sack, but dawg  you are just flawless my n*gga . Jada got a pretty good album, but yours will be the album of the summer ,fall and so on. Maybe you can do a collabo with Dirty out Montgomery !!! Mannie did and it was scorchin' ! Well done whoadie !!!"
676,5,"a warning this album will be very addictive for any listener as it is so good.highly recommended.a masterpiece.buy,buy,buy."
677,5,"Youve got to believe in something is the soundtrack to the happiest times in my life. I bought it when I was 15 years old back in 1996. It is such an optimistic happy record with much heart and soul. If wishes were horses, Bout A Train and I cant believe youre still with her are 3 really good tunes to go along with all the other wonderful music on this record. Spin Doctors are truly one of the most underated bands in a long time because for whatever reason only their first album(and some recognition for their sophmore record) was  recognized. This album would definitely be in my pick for one of the top ten of the decade. I bought it in 96' and I still love it today."
678,3,"I just didn't feel the soul in most of this album.  I was psyched to get it, but I feel disappointed.  It isn't the hard, driving trance that I expected.  In the CD insert, Armin says he's trying to get back to what he thinks are the roots, or glory days, of trance.  He says he was going for a sound like old Oakenfold-type stuff-a little softer, melodic and flowy.  I can hear what he's going for, but it misses the mark for the most part.  CD 2 has the best stuff, I think.   Track 4, Perfect Wave, is a rare example of old Oakenfold stuff rehashed.  It's great.  Other than that it doesn't do anything for me until we get to tracks 8 and 9, Totally Fascinated and Rise, which are both also great.<BR>I give the CD 3 stars based on just those 3 songs."
679,1,this is a horrible cd. fat boy slim has for a long time corrupted our music with his mainstream whorthless crap and ive had enough.  i sat buy idly until he remixed smells like teen spirit.  he ruined a perfect song and runed it into a worthless funk song. i think the populace should boycote his junk to purge the airways of tthis low level crap.
680,5,"this is an amazing cd i bought it at one of jerseys concerts when they played with alexisonfire and at the mercy of inspiration ive personally met the guys from the band and i have a signed cd. saturday night is an amazing song, jersey deserves more fame then they already have.<br />awesome ceedee"
681,5,"Just by listening to this song made me wanna buy his whole CD when it comes out. This song is just SO GOOD! Listen to it, you'll fall in love with it instantly. He has become one of my favorite singers. I LOVE RYAN CABRERA!"
682,5,"I bought this CD with expectations that it would be a good CD. Ok, so after listening to the first uh... 12 songs, the CD blew me away. Every song on there is unique in their own ways. The vocals are amazing, and the quality sound of the guitar/vocals will blow you away like it did me. Many of the songs even have catchy electronic rifts to them. Never have I heard such a different (in an AWESOME way) sound in the Christian music industry. You like hard rock/hip hop stuff? This CD is for you. You like catchy lyrics that have Christ-like meanings in them? This CD is for you. You like awesome vocals that can hit high notes if necessary, and rap at the same time? This CD is for you. <BR>Bittersweet and Jacksonfive are the two best songs on there I think. Those songs are very professionally put together. They sound amazing. Jacksonfive features the lead vocalist from Kutless and Demon Hunter, and features Paul Wright as well. Bittersweet is a head-banging flat out rock song that has a very catchy chorus. Jacksonfive is hard stuff too, but it gets your dance moves on as well. Awesome hiphop/reggae/metal stuff in that song. Like I said, each song on there is unique and will be stuck in your head for days if not weeks, trust me. I couldn't get this CD out of my CD player for about 2 weeks. This is my first review, and I have about 80 Christian CD's, so you can tell that this CD has impacted me. I don't know if it beats Thousand Foot Krutch's &quot;Phenomenon,&quot; however. It's certainly close! We'll see who pulls off in the end. I don't TFK will ever let me down though.<BR>If you like mainsteam stuff, then you most likely, hopefully, undoubtedly, know Linkin Park. Very similar to Falling Up. I recommend Falling Up's CD (as well as TFK's &quot;Phenomenon&quot; CD) times infinity! For people who mainly listen to Christian music, Falling Up closely resembles a mixture of Thousand Foot Krutch, Anberlin, Kutless, and Furthermore. Just my opinion. Someone said something about resemblence to Switchfoot. Sorry, but I seriously can't see that...<BR>Anyway, I'm done. Buy this CD now!"
683,5,"If you are a fan of old-time music or just discovering its timeless appeal you should hear this band.  I first discovered the Reeltime Travelers on the Cold Mountain Soundtrack and recently caught them on the Great High Mountain Tour featuring the music of \\""Oh Brother Where Art Thou\\"" and talk about a rompin' good time. When hearing this group of musicians you can't help but feeling moved and shaking your body.  Mainly fiddle and banjo driven, this disc is a fantastic representation of the Travelers live show. An all acoustic mix of traditional folk music and bluegrass infused old-time dance tunes that will bring you back to a simpler time."
684,4,"These guys were part of Beachwood Sparks for many years. Now they are channeling the spirit of Cat Stevens and all psychedelic ghosts of the past. This is because when you take LSD you die. Sometimes a phoenix is born. Sometimes you just become some doofus pumping gas on DeLongpre and Highland, dreaming about buying a cottage in Spain. Drugs rearrange all learned patterns. All school is only in three dimensions. I am talking about the onement, which Terence McKenna has referred to in his writings. There is only so much reality the brain can comprehend. Music opens the door to those altered states. It's only at certain hours, when secret radio signals broadcast this new dimension. The ghosts of the past (Cat Stevens, Gram Parsons, Tiny Tim) make an appearance. All Night Radio creeps up on you like bad dreams and strong acid. It's burns into your soul. The lessons are don't grow old. All rebellion is against a fiction &quot;them&quot; which is supposed to be society. But society is mostly trying to avoid the temptation of the latest reality show. Anything with &quot;radio&quot; in the title is a good idea."

686,5,"This is a truly excellent album, it's one of a kind. It's intense and rich in philosophical lyrics. It transports you into a different world. I stronly believe that it's Bunbury's best piece of work aside Heroes del Silencio. In fact, it's the best rock albums I have ever heard, can't get enough of it, better than &quot;radical sonora.&quot;"
687,5,"I'm only going to say a few words on this so I don't start sounding redundant. I Hate Myself is REAL emo. if you listen to bands like dashboard confessional, thinking what you're hearing is emo then you're saddly mistaken and this cd is definitely not for you. I'm absolutely serious when I say that I Hate Myself is a brilliant cd full of brilliant chords and brilliant lyrics. buy it, you won't be disappointed."
688,5,"Almost 25 years have passed since these guys started releasing albums.  I've been a fan since 1984.  So 'Powerslave' is still my absolute favorite, although I know in my heart that 'Piece of Mind' and 'The Number of the Beast' are better albums.  Both 'Brave New World' and 'Dance of Death' I tend to rank right below this trilogy of masterpieces.  If five years apart from Bruce and 10 years apart from Adrian were needed to bring about this renaissance for the band then so be it.  These guys are smokin' again.  I think I was more disappointed when Adrian left the band then when Bruce left, simply because by the 90's it was obvious that Bruce had to do his own thing.  I've always been a huge fan of Adrian's songwriting.  The evidence of his greatness on this album is obvious - 'Wildest Dreams', 'Paschendale', 'Journeyman' and the underrated 'Face in the Sand' are all top-notch tracks.  The album standout though is 'Rainmaker' - by far Dave's best writing credit.  And Janick's 'Dance of Death' title track again illustrates how much of a worthy member of the band he is.  With Adrian's departure, I did not care for this guy in the band, but he's proven to be a great songwriter over the years.  Now we have both him and Adrian - could it be any better?  The album does have a few weak tracks - 'Gates of Tomorrow', 'New Frontier' and 'Age of Innocence' - but a weak track by Iron Maiden is still a pretty good song.  Buy it - this album cannot disappoint."
689,5,"The track for Sleepy Hollow is an overwhelming and chilling collection of orchestral music indeed. Many of the titles fit the scene perfectly. The choir does their best in the one called&quot;Into The Woods&quot; while the violins get their share of center stage in&quot;The Chase.&quot; Definatly Elfman's best,(Batman Returns sharing first place)this track is perfect to play during a film with no music  or while your driving home on a long trip, if you're not too disturbed by the chorus and the sinister violins and drums."
690,5,"This is one of the best CD's I've heard this year. Check 'em out, they're a great band - even better live!!!!!"
691,5,"Nearly 2 years after the release of HISTORY BOOK I,PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE,BLOOD ON THE DANCE FLOOR was released with re-use of 8 original HISTORY tracks. Those tracks would appear on this album in dance mix form. SCREAM is a duet between the King Of Pop and his sister Janet Jackson. I like the sound of HISTORY,STRANGER IN MOSCOW and 2 BAD. THIS TIME AROUND,YOU ARE NOT ALONE,EARTH SONG and MONEY are very cool. The title track tells about a murderess named Susie. MORPHINE really rocks. IS IT SCARY? and GHOSTS are ideal for Halloween. SUPERFLY SISTER is pretty cool also."
692,2,This CD pretty much sucks. I find it hilarious that the Amazon.com reviewer called this &quot;one of 2003's best releases&quot;...the only possible explanation is that he was afraid of getting shot by fiddy.
693,5,"Best album of 2004!!!! OK, it's only 2 months into the year but this album will be hard to beat. It is one of the most complete albums I have heard. There is NOT one bad song on it. BUY IT NOW!!!"
694,4,"It is a fun cd full that really gives you a peek at what it was like to be at one of the Rat Pack's performances.  But it is a little lacking in the music area for me.  A bit too much laughing anc cutting up, but that's why you buy the live cd isn't it?"
695,4,This cd is a great cd for people who love old school rap. It is deffentally worth checking out. There name might not be that big but i am sure if you checked them out you would agree with me that they are a great group.
696,5,"aye this album is sweet, only one song i cant stand is priceless, gives me headaches...otherwise this cd is they're 3rd best...first is s.c.i.e.n.c.e then morning view and now this, fungus amongus is a little too funky and make yourself could be better.  but otherwise yeah the album just came out so if u like incubus's other stuff u will for sure like this album.. ive had it for a good 3 or 4 weeks now evn tho it came out yesterday, so i was more excited about it then.. but yeah definitley good album"
697,5,"I saw the film in Bangkok this xmas. I sat close. The cinema was almost empty. As the film began the car comes towards you through the snow and Portman's haunting music comes out of the trees like a cold river and seeps into your skin. Later in the film, variations of it entice but do not intrude.  Weeks later I went into Amazon and heard a clip and had to have this haunting melody. The CD is only 35 minutes so put it on repeat and be carried away on this moody, sad and luxurious melody. It is the best light classical music I have heard for years.  Sublime, truly."
698,4,"After seeing The Buddy Holly Story long ago, and recognizing the influence he had on the Beatles, i.e. Crickets/Beatles, I knew that one of these days, I'd get some compilation of his stuff, and I just did a few days ago.  Also, the deaths of he, the Big Bopper, and Ritchie Valens on 2 February 1959, the troubles with the law faced by Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard's turning to religion, and Eddie Cochran's auto death, signalled the death of real rock until the Beatles picked up the torch.  The list of songs includes Holly with and without the Crickets.  Highlights:<br />Originally a country song, the #1 &quot;That'll Be The Day&quot; with its electrified galloping riffs, made Holly a hit on both sides of the Atlantic.<br />The rollicking skiffle of &quot;Oh Boy!&quot; followed &quot;That'll Be The Day&quot;, peaking at #3 in the UK, but only #10 in the US.  From the guitar riffs, I can see the influence he had on the Beatles early albums.<br />A more romantic flavour is shown in the UK #4 &quot;Maybe Baby&quot; a mid-paced effort.  &quot;Think It Over,&quot; an exercise in classic early rock, barely missed the Top Ten in the UK.  It features a piano solo.<br />Holly's first solo was &quot;Peggy Sue&quot; with a running rhythm guitar and drum, was his last solo US Top Ten hit, reaching #3, but #6 in the UK.  The jangly guitar in the midsection is yet more evidence of his influence on the Fabs.  It's B-side, the lovely &quot;Everyday&quot;, features collaborator Norman Petty's wife on the celeste and drummer Jerry Allyson clapping his hands on his knees.  A sequel was made of the A-side, &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot;, which in turn inspired a Kathleen Turner movie in 1986.<br />Not all Holly's songs did well.  The mid-paced &quot;Heartbeat&quot; has a somewhat calypso beat.  It sadly failed, reaching #30 in the UK.  In the US...don't ask!  &quot;Midnight Shift&quot; has a slower sound reminiscent of classic R&amp;B, and was an early song released his star shone.  It only reached #26 in the UK.<br />The more rockabilly &quot;Rave On&quot; was a solo Holly song that peaked at #5 in the UK, his best solo posting while alive.  John Cougar Mellencamp covered this less successfully on the Cocktail soundtrack.<br />&quot;True Love Ways&quot; with its string section is probably my second favourite Holly song after &quot;That'll Be The Day&quot;, showing a much softer side of him compared to his earlier recordings.  Another lush song with strings is &quot;It Doesn't Matter Anymore&quot;, which was a posthumous UK #1.<br />Holly also did cover songs, such as Bobby Darin's &quot;Early In The Morning&quot; and Chuck Berry's fast-paced &quot;Brown Eyed Handsome Man.&quot;  The latter's B-side was the more soft and wistful &quot;Wishing&quot;, which became a Top Ten hit in its own right in the UK.<br />&quot;Words Of Love&quot; never became a hit for Holly, but this is probably better known because the Beatles recorded it for their Beatles For Sale album.<br />In reading the chart postings of each song, I noticed how much more Buddy was appreciated in the UK rather than his home country.  The good that came out of that is better taste on part of the Brits, particularly a certain Paul McCartney, who now owns Buddy Holly's song catalogue.<br />This includes the US and UK chart positions each song reached.  Sadly, it does not include &quot;Well Alright&quot;, &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;, &quot;It's So Easy&quot; and &quot;Raining In My Heart&quot;, but this collection had most of what I wanted so I sprang for it.  And as coming Monday is the sad anniversary of the Day The Music Died, I thought this would be a fitting time to review this.his star shone.

699,5,"I know I have stated this before but it is worth stating again...Erasure is my favorite synth-pop group from the '80s. Their music is irresistably catchy and impossible not to like. Back in 2000, I was disappointed that the group's latest studio album of original material \\""Loveboat\\"" was not going to be released domestically in the US (now it has). I bought it despite the error in judgement from the group's supposedly US distribution deal with Maverick Records. What \\""Behaviour\\"" was to the Pet Shop Boys is \\""Loveboat\\"" is to Erasure. \\""Loveboat\\"" was a more somber, moodier album than the group's past albums. One of my favorite songs off the cd happens to be \\""Moon and the Sky\\"". The combination of heartfelt lyrics and melancholy melodies really got to me. When I came across the remixes to the song plus acoustic versions of \\""Baby Love\\"" (by The Supremes) and \\""A Little Respect\\"" (my all time favorite Erasure song), I bought it immediately. I certainly enjoyed the remixes a lot. I particuarly thought that JC's Heaven Scent Radio Re-Work remix and Sleaze Sisters Anthem Mix were the best of the five remixes. I primarily bought the single for the acoustic songs though. I just flipped over the acoustic songs. I particularly loved the duo's cover of The Supremes' \\""Baby Love\\"". \\""A Little Respect\\"" sounded absolutely amazing acoustically as did the songs from \\""Loveboat\\"" too. \\""Moon and the Sky Plus\\"" was definitely well worth the money I forked over."
700,4,"Over a year after its release, Just Whitney is Whitney's worst selling album, being certified as only Platinum, this is not a secret. Unfortunately also, the three singles which were released all peaked at the 70s and 80s positions, which is for sure a disappointment for many fans.<br />But owning the album for over a year, I think there was a lot of politics involved that caused the low sales. YES, 'Just Whitney' is not The Bodyguard, and is not My Love is Your Love, or any of those other timeless masterpieces, but it is not bad at all. The album carries a very personal theme to Whitney, hence the fans loved it. For the casual listener though, the message comes out a bit too serious, an important factor that caused the failure of not only Just Whitney, but also Madonna's American Life album.<br />Another factor is the media, I don't think the radio stations that long talked about Whitney were very welcoming of tracks that diss those very same stations.<br />Last but not least, Arista's ex-CEO, L. A. Reid (who recently was fired due to his incompetence),, All of Whitney's previous work was released with Clive Davis, but this one was released with L. A. Reid, who also released TLC, Toni Braxton, and Santana's recent releases, all of which FLOPPED due to lack of promotion and horrible business decisions. If it was Whitney alone, one would say, but that record label suffered a lot, hence he was asked to exit by the parent company (BMG).<br />The album is worth picking up, songs like &quot;One of Those Days&quot;, which should be a spring season anthem, &quot;Tell Me No&quot;, an explosive motivation and self-esteem song, and &quot;Unashamed&quot; make it worth buying.<br />Recommended"
701,5,"If you have an appreciation for fine literature, then you will love Dustin Kensrue's writing style.  The title track is adapted from a little known short story by Al Burian, The Burn Collector.  &quot;The Abolition of Man&quot; is adapted from C.S. Lewis' book by the same title.  Thrice is not a conventional band by any means.  People slap labels on them, but Thrice does well to supercede the labels and prove they do not fit comfortably along side the emo, punk or hardcore genres.  If you're just now discovering Thrice, I advise you to see them live.  In my opinion, they put on the best live performance of any rock band."
702,3,"Duderotomy: I know exactly what you are talking about....the song that is playing in the background when they arrive at the party, the 1st song at the party.<BR>To All:  It's not the PM Dawn song and it's not the &quot;Exploration of Space&quot; song that everyone seems to think it is. There are 3 songs played, evidently we've come to the conclusion of the last 2 songs, but not the 1st. I've heard &quot;Exploration of Space&quot;, every version of that song, even the 8 minute long version.... It's not the same song, so stop saying that it is. It isn't! Unfortunately, I do not know the name of the song.... but when it comes to rare songs such as this one I don't stop hunting for it until I find it. As soon as I find it, I will let all of you know.  Wish me luck."
703,5,"I just pulled this cassette out of my closet to listen to after a long time,  and it is still great.  I'm not a fan of the late 70's songs and on,  but the oldies are unbeatable.  <br />Heaven and Paradise,  For Your Precious Love, Let the Good Times Roll, and Rockin Robin all on one CD is a great value,  since in my opinion all those artists were one hit wonders.  And the Kid Frost song is great too.   <br />This is just a superb soundtrack"
704,5,"This here rekkid has gotten me excited once again about the possibilities.  Production work here is tops, thanks to artist EL-P.  Not your same-old samples here, instead, EL-P dredges up shining objects from our wretched pop culture wasteland, then embeds them with care into dead-on rhythms that just downright work, ya'll!  EL-P is so good that this record would make a compelling instrumental-only project.  But that is not all.  The MC'in here is just as remarkable.  Lyric invention here, folks.  The lyrics and gritty delivery paint stark pictures that move and fascinate me, even after repeated listens.  In my humble opinion, this is the finest release of the last few years. Support these fine artists!"
705,5,i seen it on tv ilove the songs on it will it ever be in stores at all
706,5,"When i first found this &quot;album&quot; (yes a vinal disc) i totaly freaked out..  it had been out of print for years.. (i think i got it in the late 80's) i grabbed it, (was brand new) and children of the sun used record and hurried home..   what really got me was its part two of children of the suns story...  1991 is kind of a remake of children of the sun, and it explains the world being destroyed by war, and we are taken away by the children of the sun.. it continues on from there.. the last song is a rockin tune called 'in my room'..  but all in all, for all of you you hunger for more of the children of the sun saga, get this..  its a great investment..  one not that i did not see in the cd booklet that is in the record booklet is a mentioning of the children of the sun is a trilogy, and this is part 2..  i havent found any other information is there is actually a third part..."
707,1,"I have no idea why there are so many glowingly positive reviews here, but I'm going to give it an honest review that both the album and other Offspring fans deserve. Ignition and Smash were The Offspring's best albums because they were fresh and didn't have a forced feel to them. Ixnay was a very good album, but The Offspring lost their edge. Ixnay was the album where bits of their lame joking began to surface (Don't Pick It Up and Cool To Hate come to Mind, but at least they were catchy). Any album from Americana up to their latest Splinter is just a rehash to attempt to cash in on their previous successes, and it's not working. It's now clear as day that The Offspring are out of ideas. They've re-used similar song titles and entire themes from Americana up, and Splinter is no different. Spare Me has the same exact \\""she cheated on me\\"" theme of Self-Esteem, yet with the latter's seriousness replaced with embarrassing Latin Lounge music. Plus, Brian Holland's singing is extremely irritating on Splinter. I know he can sing normally without his now-patented whininess because he sang I Wanna Be Sedated in Idle Hands perfectly. I'm upset I got this as a gift, because it's nowhere near the calibre of Ignition and Smash. Also, whomever says Splinter harkens back to their Ignition days is dead wrong and has never heard Ignition as far as I'm concerned. Songs like Da Hui, which unnecessarily use the word \\""f*ck\\"" at least 25 times over a pisspoor guitar riff don't make it like anything they've done on Epitaph because they never did anything that thoughtless on that label. It worked on Bad Habit because it wasn't in every single line. Now, they're just beating a dead horse with songs like the ones they do now. I think the Da Hui's so fast because The Offspring probably figured listeners wouldn't notice how bad it is if they only made it 90 seconds long. We did notice though. The Offspring seem to believe the more they put \\""whoaaahhh\\""s and \\""yeahhhh\\""s in their songs, the more successful their songs will be, but no amount of \\""whoahh\\""s can salvage this thoughtless album. Or Conspiracy. Or Americana. I offer The Offspring a challenge: Make an album that doesn't involve even one song that has \\""whoah\\""s in it. I know they can't do it. And no, The Offspring were never Latin-influenced (can't stand misinformed people); they use middle-eastern riffs. See their first self-titled release that features Tehran for the best example. Also, check out the rest of their songs on The Offspring's debut that'd make the 10 year old run away screaming for his mum: songs like Beheaded, Jennifer Lost the War, and Blackball.<br />I'm out."
708,5,"This is an excellent collection of mellow African blues,nothing is too complicated in this music - really simple, organic sounds with beautiful rythems and wonderful guitar playing.I would recommend Toure to any serious music fan, and this is my personal favourite out of all his albums."
709,5,"While every other punk band is out there mimicking everyone else Blink-182 is still doing there own thing and setting there own standards. There is one thing that I enjoy most about the band and its that they are origanal and no other bands sound like them. Tom is an amazing vocalist and guitarist as well as Mark on bass and vocals, as usual Travis is still the absolute best drummer around so those 3 together form one of the greatest bands around. There new album is outstanding and very deep. They have put so much time into and im glad they did, The new album is the best yet and im sure there will be many more. Blink-182 isnt pop it isnt pop punk Blink-182 is a band straight forward and there new cd shows that they really are here to stay."
710,4,"Not a perfect sample of Mancicni's rich and award filled musical career, but probably as much as you could get on one CD. Here and there I would've included different cuts, but you can't please all the fans all the time."
711,5,"I've listened to this cd twice now and feel that it has to be one of Trace's best works yet. He makes you feel these ballads when he sings them. You can feel the heartache in \\""One Nightstand\\"" and the  sexual exuberance in \\""One Of Those Nights\\"". Then just when you think he's done all he can do, he comes on with \\""Rough & Ready\\"" and makes you want to just get down and rock and roll. Each song will touch someone differently and that what makes this cd such a prize. I'm definately glad I ordered this cd and it will be in my player a long time."
712,5,"When I had the opportunity to see Wesley play live in 1999, I stood by the edge of the stage and yelled, &quot;Play 'Shoot My Jam Session' down!&quot;, repeatedly.  After ignoring me for the better part of 45 minutes, Willis had all he could stand.  &quot;H*ll no!  I ain't gonna play no motherf*cking 'Shoot My Jam Session Down'!  That's hellride music!&quot;, came his reply.  Well, what could I do?  You don't argue with a 350 lb schizophrenic who's obviously being tormented by his &quot;demons&quot;.  Not if you aren't prepared to endure a good headbutt.  Still, that song was and continues to be one of my favorites.  <br />In general, I find that there are two basic types of Willis song.  There's songs about things that happen to him (ie. &quot;shoot my jam session&quot;, &quot;i wupped Batman...&quot;, &quot;they threw me out of church&quot;, etc) and songs about famous people and places.  I tend to prefer the former, and regard &quot;Shoot My Jam Session Down&quot; as a classic in that regard.  It is a window into the tortured soul of an artist on the brink of emotional and creative collapse.  Will the demons in Wesley's head win the battle for his soul?  Will they finally succeed in transforming his harmony joy ride into terrifying hellbus ride?  Will they shoot his jam session down, as it were?  The 800 or so songs he managed to record after this album came out, and before his tragic demise, would suggest that the answer was no.  <br />Though life may have dealt Wesley an absurdly compromised hand, it could never manage to ward his rock music off.<br />RIP<br />&quot;Taco Bell...make a run for the border!&quot;"
713,1,"Another reviewer wrote that this album is great \\""massage music\\"" and is therefore compatible with a state of relaxation.  And I sadly have to agree! If you're looking for energetic and rousing battle songs that testify to the courage of the ancient Scots, you're definitely NOT going to find it here.  These songs are utterly lacking in energy and inspiration.  It seems the New Age movement has emasculated even our proudest memories of ancient courage and valor.    This album is an insult to the memory of the brave kinsmen who struggled against many worthy adversaries to achieve dignity and freedom.  The lyrics reflect little more than self pity, and the music could not stand alone without the vocals as most of the \\""songs\\"" do not even have a strong melody by themselves.    I was expecting some rousing music such as that found in the old tune called \\""Men of Harlech\\"", a famous Welsh song that has been rewritten time and time again to inspire Her Majesty's warriors on to battle, as in the movie \\""Zulu\\"", for example.    So if you want some bland bedtime music buy this album, but if you want to be inspired with the glories of Scotland, look elsewhere."
714,5,"Jay-Z is probably the best rapper to ever live in my opinion.  He showed off his raw talent on this album, Reasonable Doubt, he was hungry.  After the success of this album he started to get more commercial, and people diss him for that, but he still has the most tremendous flow out of any rapper alive.  Yes, sometimes his rapping in his newer stuff may sound chilish, but damn I just love his flow.  Makes me want to cry its so beautiful.  Well if you want the old raw same old flow Jay-Z, Reasonable Doubt is for you.  It is my favorite hip-hop album and I cherish it with my life."
715,5,"Listen up, people! This is an awesome Blink album. Dont listen to that person below who said \\""I like the pop-punk genre, but this one's a bit too pop for me\\"". That's the opinion of some little 12 year old who does'nt understand anything anyway. This album is less poppy than their last 2 albums put together. Every band should grow and mature if they dont want to be left behind and this is just what Blink did. How boring would it be if Blink released the same old album every year? It would get old real quick. Look, my point is that true fans of Blink and Box Car Racer will love this new sound. If you are just a one dimensional, casual fan who loved Blink for their immature lyrics you probably wont like this. But then again, those so-called \\""fans\\"" probably think Blink's first album was \\""Enema of the State\\"". Buy this album! You will fall in love with everything from the deeper more mature lyrics to the beautiful and thought provoking segways linking the songs together. The begining of \\""Stockholm Syndrome\\"" includes a letter written to Mark Hoppus' Grandmother by his Grandfather during WW2 and is very touching. As Blink said, \\""This album is meant to be listened to all the way through in one sitting to be fully enjoyed and appreciated\\""."
716,4,"I suppose Brewer and Shipley were &quot;one hit wonders&quot; to most, but not where I came from (Kansas). Tom &amp; Mike were our local heroes, KC area boys who made a name for themselves doing what they loved, making music.<br />Much of their best music didn't get AM radio airplay.  &quot;Oh Mommy&quot;, was our pseudo-hippie anthem and, thankfully, is included in this woefully inadequate compilation.<br />Tom &amp; Mike harmonize as well as any brother act.  Their songs have a wonderful folkie sound that harkens back to a safer, simpler time when &quot;make love not war&quot; was our slogan.<br />I originally gave this CD 3 stars because this &quot;collection&quot; misses quite a few of my favorite B/S songs like, &quot;Song From Platte River&quot;, &quot;Don't Want To Die In Georgia&quot;, and Jackson Browne's &quot;Rock Me On The Water&quot;.<br />But I added back one star because it includes my favorite B/S song, &quot;Rise Up (Easy Rider)&quot;, and another great one &quot;Fifty States of Freedom&quot;.<br />It's a shame that Rhino or some other smart label hasn't put together a decent B/S package."
717,5,"This is the 4th US Maple record, and if you are a first time listener, this might be a good place to start. Perched somewhere between the mellowness of Talker and the sporadicness of Sang Phat Editor, this album shows why US Maple are one of the most unique and essential bands in rock music today. \\""Ma Digital\\"" has a twisted groove that snakes around the drums, sometimes veering to far, but never off the track. \\""Rice Aint Afraid Of nothing\\"" manages to balance tenderness and tension in a way only seen by this group. Songs such as \\""Chang, You're Attractive,\\"" and \\""Babe\\"" also play like a drunken ballad, but with understanding of tone and time that songs seem blow in the wind like a ship's sail, sometimes rough sometimes smooth, but always beautiful. \\""Open A Rose\\"" is pure genius as it balances a sort of dance-y rhythm with a sped up guitar part, and manages to take a rickety rhythm that turns into a jam and then explodes at the end into a beautiful mess. \\""You Don't Have To Wait\\"" is twisted blues soul that makes you wanna bob with the broken beat. US Maple is at the top of the list for  strange guitar rock, but also a wonderful take on the sound and presentation of a song, all the parts played, but not as you think they should be, some faster, some some slower, some stuttered, but always in time. There is only one US Maple, and you will realize this after hearing this wonderfully twisted assortment of songs."
718,5,"And its REMASTERED!! Music to my ears, considering the only other copy I had of it was on vinyl. This CD is a masterpiece, I don't know what more I can say. The Moody Blues, especially Justin Hayward's talent are so underrated and underappreciated. I wish this album was longer, 8 songs is so short. &quot;Lost In A Lost World&quot; just a great opener, to what is probably one of the best Moody Blues albums. &quot;New Horizons&quot; is my favorite song, its so beautiful and melodic. I love the guitar tones they use on it. Just amazing. While &quot;For My Lady&quot; has a sort of sailing out on the open sea feeling to it, short and sweet. &quot;Isn't Life Strange&quot; is another song that just hits me. The entire album is just wonderful. Every song fits perfectly. This band is so talented. This album holds the test of time, being 31 years old already it still has the power to reach out and engulf you into the beauty and wonder that is The Moody Blues. I recommend this album to anyone, even if you are just starting to discover the MBs. I got into them maybe 5 years ago, and I know its late but this band just blew me away. Especially when compared to alot of today's music, that lacks any sort of talent.. the MBs are refreshing in that, yes the music might be considered &quot;old&quot; but their talent surpasses time. Beautiful album."
719,5,"The test of a real great singer is versatility. Rod Stewart has it! He's not only a legendary rock star but has become a great balladeer with the birth of \\""It Had To Be You...The Great American Songbook.\\"" He could also sing these time-tested standards from the Great American Songbook, interpret them with feelings and do justice to the songs as well.<br /><br />I must admit that I only became a fan of Rod the Fab (a title I coined - Rod as the Fabulous interpreter of the Great American Songbook) when he recorded the standards from the GAS, although there were occasional hits he sung that really appeal to me like \\""Reason To Believe,\\"" \\""I Don't Want To Talk About It\\"" and \\""You're In My Heart.\\""  And now I'm a forty-something fan!<br /><br />He does it again this time with \\""As Time Goes By...

720,2,"Krayzie Bone's first album as a solo artist neither fails completely nor captivates the listener as his former Bone-Thugs and Harmony achieved. Krayzie, the second member of the former rap group to release a solo album, fails to convince the listener that he has a music career after Bone-Thugs and Harmony. Krayzie does not let his street credit slide in this album; giving Bone fans something to cheer about. However, Krayzie fails to realize what has made Bone Thugs and Harmony successful. Lyrics derived from the street with vocal harmonies and catchy choruses. Krayzie Bone continues with the image of the group but fails to accomplish what the group did. When Krayzie and Bone-Thugs and Harmony collaborate on certain tracks, the teamwork and harmonious vocals are tremendous, creating a tune, listeners enjoy. This enjoyment lasts very short as Thug Mentality does not seem to captivate my mentality for good music."
721,2,Too bad they couldn't just have Kelly Clarkson singing the entire album herself.  I can't stand Clay Aiken's over-pronunciation glory noting.  I'd just buy Kelly's Grown-up Christmas List and O' Holy Night on iTunes
722,5,"I truly respect Clay and the morals he has.  I fell in love with him during auditions and think he was robbed in the final!  This CD is just wonderful.  I too, usually buy a CD and like a few songs but just love this whole CD!  Very romantic music and such a voice!"
723,5,"This has got to be one of the best-produced albums of any genre, ever. John Pizzarelli's vocalese is astonishing; not only can he play unbelievable riffs on the guitar, he can sing right along with them. The song Avalon comes as close to being a perfect arrangement as anything I've ever heard- absolutely brilliantly arranged and brilliantly played. I love jazz and anything by John Pizzarelli, but this is truly an Ultimate album. If you only get one Pizzarelli album, or one jazz album for that matter, this is the one to buy."
724,5,"I've listened to this album probably fifty times now.  And I can't wait to listen again.  What is it about Elvis?  Why aren't there more artists like him?<BR>Okay, the review part.  Best song: Can you be True?  Low point:  When Green Eyes Turn Blue (so far, I just can't get into this one . . .)<BR>The album:  Sounds kind of like jazzy standards (think . . . ahem . . . Diana Krall?), but with a decidedly Elvis touch.  The lyrics are great, his voice is pure, and for the most part the arrangements are wonderfully economical - when flourishes do appear they seem to detract from the intimacy that characterizes this album.  Great transistions from minor to major, no guitars - 'though Elvis plays piano on a few songs.  The album isn't perfect - some songs get a bit too 'cabaret' - but all in all, five stars."
725,5,"Bubba Sparxxx definitely delivers on this album.  I've played this album more in the short time I've had it than I've ever played his debut.  Bubba Sparxxx HAS stepped up his game.  That is not hearsay or gossip; that's truth.  And if you thought Timbaland lost it (as I foolishly began to think), then you are in for a treat.  Songs such as Nowhere perfectly blend the now inspired pair.  Timbaland's beat (sorta slowed down cry Me A River) coupled with Bubba's thoughtful lyrics create a musical experience.  Definitely one of the best songs that I have heard this year.  And when Timbo merges Cry Me A River into it...you can do nothing but REWIND.  His artistry continues on `She Comin Round', which uses, I guess, some sorta bluegrass country sample that sounds lame at first but quickly grows on you.  Bubba's flow on this song is almost perfection.  Then Timbo breaks down the beat, lets it ride, comes back with the original beat THEN merges it with Work It!  A Complete classic.  Timbaland is not a producer anymore...he is a composer.  The best in the game.  That's pretty much how the rest of the album goes ( with Organized Noize producing a few cuts ).  Timbo just killing the beats, and Bubba rips through the album with his steady flow.  The album really is worth every penny.  The two singles Jimmy Mathis and Deliverance are just samples so if you like those songs, then the album is a must have.  Take A Load Off, Warrant, Back In The Mud ( featured on Madden 2004 too ) - all straight up banging; although I was a little disappointed that `Disappear' wasn't on it.  But still this album is one of the best this year and I would definitely recommend this album."
726,1,"Preface:  I am a die hard Bowie fan.  I've seen The Man at least 10 times in concert (including the &quot;Glass Spider Tour&quot;).  Heck, I've even seen Tin Machine twice.  This is just him phoning it in.  My personal theory is that he is amassing money to build a space colony so he can prolong his life by living in zero gravity.<br />Reality is a weak album, he didn't even try."
727,5,A friend plays this music while she's painting and let us borrow it. I can definitely see how she becomes inspired while listening to it. The string arrangements are perfect for letting your mind and creativity wander to new places. Sometimes we just put track one on repeat.
728,5,"When Kirsten Flagstad was in Norway, she used to sing Fidelio four times a week at one point in her career. Kirsten Flagstad loved Fidelio, her exact words were, \\""What a score that is! A perfect artistic holiday for singers, musicians and conductors. Nothing surpasses Fidelio in music, nothing! It is pure and human all the way through and it brings out the best in the sincere artist. It was quite a contrast going from a Fidelio performance at the opera to my Wagnerian studies at home. They are two completely different ways of singing.\\"" Kirsten Flagstad went on to become one of the great Leonores of the century and the greatest Isolde & Brunnhilde before Birgit Nilsson. Indeed, Fidelio is an opera with music of utmost sublime beauty. It is Beethoven's first and only opera. And you can hear Kirsten Flagstad in the famous 1951 Salzburg festival recording with Wilhelm Furtwangler.<br />This recording of Fidelio is simply divine. Not only is the music divine, the performance itself is divine!! From the start, the performance catches fire and the sense of inexorable advance is relentless. The urgency of the drama, the pathos are all caught in the flames of a white hot performance. Note: When I say white hot I don't mean to say that this Fidelio is wham and bang. On the contrary, the singers and orchestra are able to project a terrific sense of intensity and urgency without resorting to slam bang vocal and instrumental techniques. That is one of the reasons this Fidelio is one of the greatest opera recordings ever made. The beauty of tone is always there and the drama is always alive. Everyone seem to be completely inspired. It is as if the spirit of Beethoven caugt hold of everyone at that moment and inspired them to heights that have since never been surpassed. <br />Like Kirsten Flagstad, I feel that nothing surpasses Fidelio in music. I listen to lots of other operas, including all the most famous ones. They are all great and have their own drama to it. But this one, Fidelio, is the one that comforts me in my darkest hour and inspires me to greater heights of bliss in my time of joy. I've heard so many recordings of Fidelio including all the famous sets - practically everything you can find on Amazon. I can say without a shadow of doubt that no other Fidelio set surpasses this set. Please tell me if there is. I would have to buy that set. Don't bother if you can find it on Amazon because I've already heard all those."
729,5,"Christina Aguilera decided to leave behind the teen-poppy tunes that gave her so much success and became her in a super-star, so I gotta give her real credit for takin' that big risk in her carrer. So, in this album, we get to know the real Christina, the songwriter and artist we knew was gonna appear and It's truly interesting. Using her extraordinary, multi-octave and soulful vocie, Xtina brings a wide range of styles: rock, pop, r&b, soul, jazz, gospel, hip hop, latin and funk, and opens her heart on the lyrics, much more mature and deep. <BR>If she keeps on spreading her talent and voice this way, be sure there's not going to be any Madonna, Mariah O Whitney left!"
730,5,"I work at an Irish Pub in the Cincinnati area, and I love the chance to listen to these guys play.  They really do put on a phenomenal live show.  I bought this CD for a friend from Northwestern University who likes Irish music (without him ever seeing them actually perform live) and he absolutely loves it."
731,5,This is the best CD from Lamar Campbell &amp; Spirit of Praise.  There wasn't a song on the CD that I didn't like.  There are various musical styles exhibited that tied in very well.  There is something for everyone on this recording.  Very refreshing! Excellent! I highly recommend it!
732,5,"First, I'd like to thank Neil for finally consenting to re-release this album. It's still hard for me to believe that I'm holding it in my hand. This has been a favorite of mine since it first came out. The album kicks off with a gentle waltz. \\""The Old Country Waltz\\"" is a classic crying in your beer weeper about the demise of a relationship. \\""Saddle Up The Palomino\\"" plugs in, while name dropping \\""Carmelita, the daughter of the wealthy banker\\"" and Neil's horse Melody. \\""It's a cold bowl of chili when love lets you down and it's the neighbor's wife I'm after\\"". \\""Hey Babe\\"" is a pretty love song with just the right amount of pedal steel and violin thrown in. \\""Hold Back The Tears reverts back to the subject of lost love. The difference is this time Neil urges the person he's comforting to \\""keep on trying, just around the next corner may be waiting your true love\\"". \\""Bite The Bullet\\"" does away with love in favor of lust. Plugged in again, Neil sings \\""she's a rockin love machine, I like to make her scream when I bite the bullet\\"". You can just use your imagination there. \\""Star of Bethelehem\\"" features a pretty guest turn from Emmylou Harris. \\""Will To Love\\"" is just Neil and his guitar, the only classic love song I can think of with salmon in it. I could be wrong. Everybody knows the next one. \\""Like A Hurricane\\"" is a demented guitar freakout that shows why Neil is always mentioned when the subject of greatest rock and roll guitar players comes up. We end with \\""Homegrown\\"" which might be a tribute to tomatoes like the Guy Clark song \\""Homegrown Tomatoes\\"" but I doubt it. I think we're talking herb garden here. Go out and buy this sucker. Much has been made about Neil's influence on the grunge scene of the early 1990's. Very few mention the fact that his forays into \\""power twang\\"" pre-date the entire \\""No Depression\\"" movement."
733,5,"Hailing from Boston, this swing/soul band mixes the best of both worlds and creates songs that are fun and full of substance. When they want to they can easily show their sense-of-humor in full-force, but they can also show the love and write very smooth ballads. Whatever style they're tackling, sliding over the musical form that best fits the mold, on their second full-length CD they do it with ease."
734,1,"Listen to real music. Nirvana, Neil Young, Bob Marley, The Beatles, etc. Listen to any of the above and realize that Linkin Park is not any good. Save yourself the time and money and avoid this. You'll thank me in 2 years."
735,5,"Just bought it and received it in the mail. Thanks Amazon! And thanks to Kim for making the CD. I especially like the 12\\"" version of Voyeur. It could be longer though. Kim? Why don't you do a 12\\"" version of the diamond in the ruff \\""Merc Man?\\"" I can just see the dance floor stomping to an eight minute version of the song. Wow!"
736,5,"This reviewer is guilty of a hideous crime. I will admit that I am a huge fan of Classic Rock, Progressive Rock and Electronic Music. However, I'm about to reveal a dark secret-I am a huge Kenny G fan too!! Since the release of his breakthrough 1986 album \\""Duotones\\"", I've bought every album he has released and have been following his career ever since.<br />The recently released compilation \\""Ultimate Kenny G\\"" truly lives up to its title. Basically, it's an updated version of the 1997 \\""Greatest Hits\\"" CD only with a stronger song selection. His trademark ballads \\""Songbird\\"", \\""Silhouette\\"", \\""Forever in Love\\"" and \\""The Moment\\"" are all included here as well as tracks from his last studio album \\""Paradise\\"" and his 1999 tribute to the standards \\""Classics in the Key of G\\"".<br />Also included are three rare tracks including the brand new song \\""Everlasting\\"" plus \\""Jasmine Flower\\"" which had only been previously available on the Japanese version of \\""The Moment\\"" and his version of Celine Dion's \\""My Heart Will Go On\\"" which had only been available as a free giveaway single with the initial pressings of the \\""Greatest Hits\\"" CD.<br />To top things off, no Kenny G collection would be ultimate without his trademark duets. Included in this collection are his pop duets \\""By The Time This Night Is Over\\"" with Peabo Bryson, \\""We've Saved The Best For Last\\"" with Smokey Robinson, \\""One More Time\\"" with Chante Moore and his take on Louis Armstrong's \\""What A Wonderful World\\"" complete with Armstrong's original vocal track.<br />Truly, this is The Ultimate Kenny G. So what if his music is lightweight. If people didn't like it, he wouldn't be selling millions of records. His music has found a special place in many lives including this reviewer. Whether you're a closet Kenny G fan or an outspoken diehard, \\""The Ultimate Kenny G\\"" is the most complete definitive up-to-date collection by this brilliant saxophonist and king of background noise."
737,4,"David Lee Roth's third solo album \\""A Little Ain't Enough\\"" marks something of a turning point in Diamond Dave's career, and in some ways, represents the end of an era--not just the end of David Lee Roth's relevancy as a solo artist, but the end of an era in popular music--namely 80s pop-metal.<br /><br />After the \\""Skyscraper\\"" world tour, Steve Vai left Dave's band (bassist Billy Sheehan had left prior to the tour) and Dave had to rebuild his band. Dave kept hold-overs Gregg Bissonette (drums), Matt Bissonette (bass), who had played on the \\""Skyscraper\\"" tour, Brett Tuggle (keyboards) and added guitarists Jason Becker and Steve Hunter to record this album. As everyone knows, Becker was tragically diagnosed with ALS prior to the recording of the album and was unable to tour in support of it.<br /><br />The band behind \\""A Little Ain't Enough\\"" was pretty stellar. It may not have had the big names of the \\""Eat 'Em and Smile\\"" lineup, but it was a good band. The Bissonette brothers provided a tight, muscular rhythm section, Becker certainly had the chops to be compared to players like EVH and Vai, and Tuggle's playing didn't saturate the album as it did on \\""Skyscraper.\\"" Dave himself still sounds like Dave, full of charisma and in control, blissfully unaware of the storm coming out of Seattle that is headed his way.<br /><br />When ALAE was released, Roth stated that it was a cross between the first Van Halen album and \\""Skyscraper.\\"" While there isn't a song like \\""Jamie's Cryin'\\"" or anything as good as what's on Van Halen's debut, Dave's statement makes sense. What ALAE is, more or less, is a slick, meat-and-potatoes collection of 80s Van Halen-esque rock. The bluesy \\""Tell the Truth,\\"" the country-ish \\""Sensible Shoes\\"" and the excellent mid-tempo rocker \\""Lady Luck,\\"" were the exceptions in what was Dave's return to hard rock after the synth-heavy \\""Skyscraper.\\"" A lot of care went into crafting and performing these songs and it shows. Dave and the band wanted to put out a ballsy rock record and take the world by storm.<br /><br />The problem was, more or less, timing, rather than lack of good songs. If \\""A Little Ain't Enough\\"" had been released in '89/'90, it may have had a better run on the charts. By 1991, however, this style of music, and Dave himself, were starting to be seen as stale. Even before the grunge era, audiences were yearning for something new. When Nirvana and Pearl Jam blew-up later in the year, Dave and all he was associated with were seen as passe.<br /><br />All this is a shame, because \\""A Little Ain't Enough\\"" is a good album. No, it's not a masterpiece, but it's a solid, 80s style hard rock album that fans of classic Van Halen would enjoy. The title track, \\""Lady Luck,\\"" \\""40 Below,\\"" \\""Last Call,\\"" and \\""Drop in the Bucket\\"" stand as some of Dave's best solo work. I would argue that, overall, it's just as strong as what Van Halen were doing at the time with Sammy Hagar, with their \\""For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge\\"" album. It's a shame that Dave wasn't able to survive the 90s the way his former bandmates were.world by storm.    The problem was, more or less, timing, rather than lack of good songs.

738,3,"The Used is extremely over rated. Don't get me wrong, I think they're a good band and I realy do enjoy this CD. The hype this band gets is annoying though. The countless little girls I had to endure in order to see the movie life, who were opening for the used, is just one example of what a pain hype can be. These songs are no where near poignant enough to be classified as emo, but they are still strong. All in all, it's an album that's entertaining, but nowhere near the genius of bands like cursive or thursday."
739,5,"If my wife were to tell me that on the next cross country trip I could only take one &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic album my choice would be between &quot;Running with Scissors&quot; and Volume 2 of his &quot;Greatest Hits.&quot;  We get two more tracks this time around and while I am sure every single one of us would like to replace several of tracks with what we would consider better choices (I always skipped &quot;Achy Breaky Song,&quot; just like I did the original), that is always going to be true with any &quot;Weird Al&quot; hits collection.  But on the plus side &quot;Smells Like Nirvana&quot; is a recognizable classic, &quot;You Don't Love Me Anymore&quot; is the best original composition Yankovic ever wrote, and &quot;Polka Your Eyes Out&quot; is as great a polka medley as exists in the canon of Western music.  The other parodies cover the current spectrum of American music.  Yes, &quot;Weird Al&quot; does not take on the gloved one or the Material Girl this time around, but anybody that can rewrite the lyrics to songs by both the Kinks and the Red Hot Chili Peppers is a master of the form for my money.  Besides, on this one I knew all of the originals and my kids were stumped by &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (although how do you really make fun out of a song about leaving a cake out in the rain?).  I know it is really not fair to complain that these &quot;Weird Al&quot; hits collections are better than his albums (who is that NOT true for?), but there are just so many people who skip the regular albums and wait for the next hits collection to come down the road.  I would think that Volume 3 should be out before the next Star Wars movie."
740,5,"Her &quot;turtledovish&quot;,creamy, slightly gruffy voice is perfect in Mozart. All are very lovey/dovey romantic songs. I Love the repetive nature of vocal lines in Mozart's music. It's very different from later Italian composers. This music is more charming and sometimes meant to be a little comical. Thay all have a certain rhythm pattern, typical of Mozart. After a while you start to pick up on it and get the gist of the style. Then you can hear an unknown piece and single it out as Mozart. She does an incredible effort at maintaining that creamy richness, roundness, and that beauty of tone that is so necessary in Mozart ,when she is singing at high tessitura or when she is singing in pure head voice or &quot;in the mask&quot;. I think Mozart vocal music is the most difficult to do, but also the most fun."
741,4,"I SAW THE SPECIAL, AND HAVE LISTENED TO THE CD. I WAS VERY IMPRESSED. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE USUAL WILLIE, SKIP THIS ONE. BUT IF WANT TO HEAR SOME OF TODAYS MOST INFLUENCIAL ARTISTS, JOINING IN WITH A LEDGEND, THEN GIVE THIS ONE A TRY. SURE WILLIE IS A LITTLE OUT OF HIS ELEMENT WITH SOME OF THESE SONGS, BUT LETS BE REAL, HE'S A 70 YEAR OLD COUNTRY SINGER. YET IF YOU SAW THE SPECIAL, YOU COULD SEE THE LOVE THESE ARTISTS HAVE FOR HIM.AND WILLIE HELD HIS OWN, WHETHER IT WAS STEVE TYLER, OR SHANIA TWAIN, HE WAS THERE, AND THE OLD BOY CAN TRUELY PICK I GUTIAR. SO IF YOU WANT TO HEAR SOME OLD TIME FAVORITES, DONE A LITTLE DIFFERENT, GIVE THIS ONE A TRY... I LIKE IT"
742,5,"I haven't actually purchased or listened through the entire album just yet.  A friend of mine let me take a gander at his copy of the album so I could see if I would like to purchase my own.  I have not gotten past of the first track, &quot;So What&quot;.  That song is a great piece of work.  I keep listening to that track over and over.  I love it.  I'm sure I will love the rest of the album once I get to it.  I will definately purchase this album.  I would highly reccommend this to anyone."
743,5,"Much much more than I expected. Awesome beats, lyrics,  and beautiful voice . Her talent is undeniable. Definitely a must buy."
744,5,"Here is a wonderful new set of pieces to add to the often too-limited repertoire for the classical (read:Spanish) guitar. Mompou was a Catalan composer who wrote not only for guitar, but also for piano. Mr. Fletcher plays these pieces with the proper combination of inner feeling and outer flash. To his further credit, he transcribed most of the pieces here for guitar from their original piano versions in an Atlanta coffeehouse. Raise a cup of Java and listen one of the most exciting classical guitar CD's in years!"
745,1,"I'm a die hard Metallica fan.  I have every cd.  I've memorized every song.  I can play almost any solo on my guitar.  I've been to 6 concerts.  And I am the most disappointed person on the face of the earth right now.  Metallica's latest cd, St. Anger is by far the worst cd they've ever made....I'm going to take this one more step....it's by far the worst cd for sale right now.  This is NOT the Metallica we have come to love and be moved by their music.  The cd sounds basically like a group of kids banging on trash cans (Lars seriously over does it w/ his drums - very rarely stays on track w/ James and Kirk).  James appears to have lost any kind of singing talent - horrible lyrics that don't even work with the tune...when there is a tune.  No guitar riffs, not a single solo, just a bunch of banging on the drums and James talking (singing) the same words over and over.  Remember For Whom the Bell Tolls?  Creeping Death?  Sad But True?  Master of Puppets?  There is not a single song on this cd that could even slightly compare in talent or sound.  If you enjoy Metallica's past cds at all, I highly suggest you keep listening to them and save your money by avoiding this one.  I'm a serious Metallica collector, and even I want my money back after buying this cd.  If they came out with a rap cd, I can't imagine it being much worse."
746,4,"There are only eight songs on this live CD, but if you're a die-hard Nichole fan, it doesn't matter. The live interpretations are fresh - bringing in an accordion on a couple of the songs - yet simple. It's accoustic Nichole, the kind I love best: just Nichole and her piano and a few friends to fill in here and there. Nichole is such a poetic songwriter, which is even more apparent when the music is stripped down to its basics, and it still sparkles."
747,2,"I thought I would like this CD based on the songs that get radio play, but I was sorely disappointed!  On the more melodic songs, Chris Cornell's voice just ruins the entire thing, plus he can't carry a melody unless he's yelling.  Nasty, this Cd is just gross.  It's Rage with a new singer - wow, that's really original.  I suggest writing some more original lyrics and creating a new sound, not just cashing in on the old sounds of rage and soundgarden.  That shows originality alright."
748,5,"I found this cd to be a wonderful way to journey deeper into my own spiritual realms. It is amazing how each time I listen to the cd, the same guided meditation takes me on a new and richer experience. It awakened me to aspects of my inner being that I did not know existed."
749,4,"My overall view on this album is a positive one. I like it alot and is currently in my car's CD player. This band has blossomed into something much better. I originally owned their self titled album hooked by the song \\""Nothing,\\"" but this album evoles the band into something so much more. <br />1. \\""Crashing\\"" - With a rather strong drum line, this track speaks of sacrifices that don't pay off, an easy thing we can all relate to.<br />2. \\""Failure\\"" - This is the band's single, and it's a shame too because it's one of the better songs on the CD. (I don't want it to get played out) Opening with an acoustic guitar, the vocals are given a real solo here and do this well for the first time on the album. (but hey it's only track 2)<br />3. \\""Hands and Knees\\"" - This is the classic \\""Dear Mom & Dad\\"" song most bands have on least on of their albums. (I know KoRn has a few). In the interlude of the song, spanish is spoke: Pues madre y padre esta vida no quiero vivir. Basically this means, well mom and dad I don't want(or it doens't please me) to live this life. This is in my opinion, awesome. More bands need to use other languages in their songs. It twists things up.<br />4. \\""Drowning In This\\"" - opens with a rag tag drum beat and depressing lament about how \\""their's nothing good about this life.\\"" The chorus is power exclaiming \\""it's not right to feel this way,\\"" that let's the listener known that the singer is ready to change to the old way of his life, where he \\""used to feel so much better than this.\\""<br />5. \\""Empty\\"" - This is my favorite song on the CD. Again the drums are stronger than the guitar in this one, especially in the verses. The verses are deep, and are easy to relate to for me. This song is also the first time on the album we hear a scream for the vocals and they finish the song off nicely.<br />6. \\""Bruises\\"" - This the heaviest song on the CD so far. The first explicit is also spoken(screamed?) \\""shut the f*ck up!\\"" I'm not sure how I feel about this song. There's betterones on the CD. A lot of screaming and heavy guitars/bass/drums.<br />7. \\""Making Me Hate You\\"" - Grungy guitar opens the song, and is followed by drums like normal. (They could really use a drum opening or bass opening.) This song has sort of a rap feel to the verse, the flow easily and quickly. The Chorus is awesome, and my third favorite on the CD. It's powerful, angry, and convincing.<br />8. \\""Watching Me Slip\\"" - This song is primarily acoustic and vocals. A soothing orchestra (or maybe a really expensive keyboard) comes in about mid-way through the song and drives emotion deeper into the song. I love this song and Unloco does a great job on this one. <br />9. \\""Becoming i\\"" - A little guitar rift opens and then some quiet vocals. These pick up when the drums enter. There's a good progression and a somewhat tribal drum beat. I dig that. This song is rather quiet through out until about 3:17, then he just goes off and screams. It sounds great and it gets your blood moving.<br />10. \\""Fold\\"" - This song has some good vocals and is the second song on the Cd that uses an explicit. \\""It's half past noon, another f*cking bad day.\\"" I'm not sure about the focus of this song but it has good progression so I like it. I think he's maybe saying that he gives in or \\""folds\\"" like in poker.<br />11. \\""Neurotic\\"" - This is probably the only song on the CD that I skip. It's got good progressions but the vocals have some sort of effect on them that just turns me off. <br />12. \\""Texas\\"" - Arguable the softest song on the CD next to \\""becoming i.\\"" This song is just amazing. Saying there's acoustic guitar and vocals just doesn't do it justice. You have to hear this one. It's about a lost girlfriend I assume and man, I think all guys can relate to that one. There's a piano in this one and helps to reflect the overall lamenting and sad mood of this song. <br />I hope this reivew helps. Enjoy this great album."
750,5,"This is Mandy Moore's best cd and I can't wait to get her new one in a few months!<br />1. In my pocket: 3/5 its okay but not the best choice for her first single.<BR>2. You Remind Me: 3/5 funky vibe to it its gets a little anyonin after a while<BR>3. Saturate me: 2/5 at first I couldnt stand this song but its starting to grow on me<BR>4. One Sided Love: 4/5 love this song espically the chorus<BR>5. Try 17: 3/5 at first I loved it but its a little boring if you listen to it to much <BR>6. Cry: 5/5 one of the best songs on the cd , this should have been the first single<BR>7. Crush: 3 and a half /5 a little to pop for me<BR>8. Only Took A Minute: 1/5 probably the worst song on the cd<BR>9. Turn The Clock Around 4/5 anyonin beginning but the rest of the song makes up for it<BR>10. Yo Yo: 5/5 another one of the best songs on the cd<BR>11. From Loving You: 5/5 the only problem its a little to slow <BR>12. Spilt Chick 4/5 happy song but a little stupid<BR>13. When I talk to you: 4/5 great song considering she actually wrote it"
751,5,"Once again Louris and company come through with a great album, with his vocals, guitar, and writing leading the way for this amazing, yet underappreciated band.  <br />Rainy Day music will be an instant favorite for those who loved Tomorrow the Green Grass and Hollywood Town Hall. Despite what some reviews have said, this album is pretty fantastic from start to finish. While there are a couple songs that fall short (particularly those written by someone other than Louris), there are very few albums these days that come so close to filling up an entire album with such addictive melodies. <br />This album proves yet again that the Jayhawks might just be the best band around that most people have never heard of.  For me, this is a welcome return to top form as I thought Smile was very disappointing.  For newcomers to the band, don't stop with this record, as this band has been doing it for years. Listen to this album, but make sure to check out Sound of Lies, Tomorrrow the Green Grass, and Hollywood Town Hall as well.  Few bands have produced more great music over the last 15 years."
752,5,"Johnny Cash At Folsom Prison is unquestionably one of the finest live albums ever recorded. The time and place, the atmosphere surrounding it, and the aura of the performance could never be repeated in today's modern world. What artist today would have the sheer umitigated gall to play an entire concert's worth of songs about prison life, murder, death, adultrey, and love for those immediately out of reach -- in front of an audience of prisoners? As the photos in the booklet clearly show, Cash is simply performing on a stage in front of a room containing 2,000 inmates -- no fence separating them, no walls, and only a couple of security guards. Indeed, Cash sits down on a stool literally inches away from the front row of prisoners to sing his mini-set of ballads, and later shakes hands with one of them (whose song he closes his performance with) and moves about them. This was a masterful show, transcendent not only for its performance, but for its sheer atmospheric effect. Cash clearly has the audience in the palm of his hand, singing songs that address prison life directly (with the prisoners whooping and hollering loudly for the most violent lines and after curses), and cracking off-color jokes against the prison establishment and taking the prisoners' side. This newly-uncensored version truly shows the great show that it was, including the classic moment where Cash announces that the show is being recorded and that you can't say words like... it is fleshed-out with a newly-invigorated sound and expansive liner notes. An absolute classic of American music that belongs in any music library."
753,5,"After the success of Tool's 1993 debut album \\""Undertow\\"", the band was already receiving acclaim for the live stint on the third annual Lollapalooza festival and for their disturbing music videos for the songs \\""Sober\\"" and \\""Prison Sex\\"". When it came time to record their sophomore effort \\""Aenima\\"", bassist Paul D'Amour left the band and was replaced by Englishman Justin Chancellor. When the band recruited David Botrill, the band wanted to broaden their progressive-metal sound to newer heights that most bands wouldn't have done when it came to make a second album. Whereas most groups try to make a second album that was more accessible or stick to the formula that made their first album great, Tool didn't do any of those things. Instead, they went to darker and more melodic territories to set the \\""Aenima\\"" album further apart from their debut album. What Tool did was make on one of the best hard rock albums of the 1990s that broke more rules on how to rock harder with a much darker sensibility. <br />The first track off of \\""Aenima\\"" is the metal-power of \\""Stinkfist\\"" with its atmospheric-like guitar intro which leads into a powerful rock tune with driving guitars from Adam Jones, melodic bass riffs from Justin Chancellor, hard-hitting drum hooks from Danny Carey, and awesome vocals from Maynard James Keenan who belts out these loud screams during the chorus. \\""Eulogy\\"" is a brilliant hard rock tune with an excellent intro of weird bass riffs, atmospheric guitar sounds, soft percussions that lasts for a couple of minutes with Maynard singing in a distorted tone and then at full tilt sings clearly once the guitar and drums come in like a powerful punch into the stomach. \\""H.\\"" is a dark, melodic guitar-driven tune highlighted by Adam Jones' expressive guitar work that sounds a little bit like Black Sabbath and King Crimson backed by Carey's gymnastic drum-style. \\""Useful Idiot\\"" is a forty-second instrumental that sounds like soft percussion sounds backing soft electrical sparks that serves as an intro to the bass-driven \\""Forty-Six & 2\\"" that is highlighted by Chancellor's bass intro along with Carey's diverse drum-style w/ beautiful percussion sounds, Jones powerful guitar charges, and Keenan's powerful vocals. <br />\\""Message To Harry Manback\\"" is a weird tune of a man talking to a man called Harry Manback backed by an ambient guitar background from Adam Jones that serves as a weirdness to the band. \\""Hooker With A Penis\\"" is a powerful hard-rock song filled by powerful drums from Danny Carey, brutal guitar charges from Adam Jones, and ferocious screams from Maynard James Keenan who can probably scream the hell out of such current divas like Mariah Carey (no relations to Tool's drummer), Christina Aguilera, and Jessica Simpson. That man is wreaked with awesomeness. The next track is a break in the middle of the album titled \\""Intermission\\"" which features a weird circus-like organ sound that shows Tool's funny side. Pretty cool intermission. Next is the melodic-power of \\""jimmy\\"" dominated by Chancellor's melodic bass-riffs, Carey's brilliant drum-power, Jones' guitar grooves, and Keenan's hypnotic vocals. \\""Die Eier Von Satan\\"" (or in translation from German to English, \\""The Eggs/Balls of Satan\\""), is a weird industrial-like tune with distorted bass riffs and percussion sounds, hard-driven guitar hooks, and vocals by Marko Fox singing in German with Gudrun Fox translating in English. <br />\\""Push*t\\"" is another weird metal track that lasts for nearly ten minutes with a fuzzy guitar track that sounds at first like buzzing bees with mesmerizing vocals from Keenan, magnificent drumming from Carey and atmospheric bass hooks from Chancellor that shows the excellent musicianship of this band. \\""Cesaro Summability\\"" is another weird track of a baby crying with distorted guitars in the background that serves as an intro to the next track \\""Aenema\\"". \\""Aenema\\"" is the album's big highlight with its melodic bass hooks, guitar grooves, powerful drums, and Keenan's powerful track that starts out as a metal-driven track until the middle of the song where Justin Chancellor's bass riffs dominate the track backing Keenan's mesmerizing vocals with Carey's powerful drumming accompanying him. Then Jones' brings in a powerful slide guitar solo until Carey comes in with this powerful drum track while Chancellor and Jones both come in with their assaults backing Keenan's vocals until the song softens up a bit and then becomes a even powerful song right through the end. Tool at its finest. <br />\\""(-) Ions\\"" is a four-minute instrumental track of atmospheric sounds and electrical sparks in the background that serves as an intro the final track of the album called \\""Third Eye\\"". The thirteen-minute song \\""Third Eye\\"" starts off with a sample of comedian Bill Hicks talking the good things about drugs and saying that all the best rock albums were made on drugs. During Hicks' talks on drugs, Tool comes in with a powerful, blistering song with intense drumming from Carey, guitar grooves from Jones, and Keenan's powerful vocals who screams in the fourth minute of the song. After four minutes, a huge instrumental part comes in from Jones, Chancellor, and Carey comes in for about a few minutes then there's a quiet break during the eighth minute part of the song until things get loud again by Keenan's ferocious vocals who screams like a madman backed by the rest of the band's powerful instrument assaults. <br />\\""Aenima\\"" is an excellent masterpiece from Tool. The band not only beat the sophomore slump but also went way beyond it. Tool would have more success to come including a headlining slot at the final Lollapalooza festival in 1997. Things however, wouldn't be so good in the years to come as lawsuits from their manager and record company came at them and forced their fans to wait for a new record in the next five years. \\""Aenima\\"" is a true testament to Tool's power as a band and as a musical force."
754,5,"After I got Junction 18's Vicious Cycle, I listened to it a few times and liked a few songs, but I could never get into it.  All of the songs seemed to go together and only a couple really stood out.  The vocals were also too quiet and you can't really hear what is being said.  All flaws from that cd are corrected with the CD Heroes from the Future.  This is one of the best cd's I've heard in a long time.  All 6 songs are absolutely awesome, sing-along-catchy.  These guys also produce eccentric thought-provoking lyrics.  These guys would probably be considered pop-punk, but aren't trying to appeal to mass audiences with their image and stupid teen-angst lyrics.  These guys matured an incredible amount from their last cd.  I would recommend this cd to anyone.  BUY IT."
755,5,"Like the review above this one, Midnight Star hasn't lost a step at all..., Belinda and the guys bring the heat.   Uptempo cuts like \\""15th Avenue, I Like(When You Dance with Me?, and VIP\\"", are off the chain.., And the ballads, \\""Movin'On, Hooked on You, and Just Because I Love You\\"", are those red light, belly-rubbin', house party smokers...., This cd is complete, tracks 1 through 15, bottom line, vintage soul at it's best, no cameos from rappers to appeal to the teen audience.., like the intro track says..,\\""M.S. in the House\\"", and only Midnight Star...., This is the best cd I have heard in the last 5 years..., finally a cd with substance, no weak tracks here..., Just put it in the deck and let it play..., so don't sleep on this....., believe me..., Midnight Star has another No Parking on the Dance Floor here, and we all remember how tight that album was....,  Pick it up!!!"
756,4,"The feeling of this album is sad these ears. Not that there aren't great songs on it, but knowing that most of the songs sound like the members are recording individual solo tracks.<br />In other words, this album sounds like a condenced &quot;solo&quot; album from 3 of the band members with no consideration for Peter's material. He is only featured on 2 of the bonus tracks.<br />Nesmith really shines though with his psychedlic tracks &quot;Tapioca Tundra&quot; and &quot;Writing Wrongs&quot;.  He gets also very experimental with &quot;Magnolia Simms&quot; which he simulates a 20s style 78 record.<br />&quot;Daydream Believer&quot; (a left over from the Pices sessons) and &quot;Valleri&quot; are the only big hits that help get big points to this album<br />Davy rings in with several good performances including &quot;The Poster&quot; and &quot;Dream World&quot;.<br />Oh, and Mickey turns in some great performances with &quot;PO Box 9847&quot; and &quot;Zor and Zam&quot; (the TV version that is on Missing Links Volume 3 is superior IMO).<br />So why I compare this to &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;.  Well look at it this way, the fabulous &quot;Pices...&quot; followed by the somewhat psychedelic but separately sounding &quot;Birds, Bees...&quot;  Then look at this: the magificent &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; followed by the  mediocre attempt at Sgt Pepper 2, &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;.  MMT is somewhat psychedelic and spacy like Birds and Bees.  Just a feeling I get from both albums.<br />Please note: I'm not saying this is a bad album and it does have  highlights, but you must think in terms of indivduality and maturity when listened next to or around earlier Monkees albums."
757,5,Este disco de Fito muetra toda su trayecoria musical. Recomiendo &quot;Tumbas de la Gloria&quot;. Es terrible que se les haya olvidado el &quot;Cable a Tierra&quot; pero se los perdono.
758,5,"I bought this on the strength of \\""No One Knows\\"" which has driven me up the wall humming it and threatened to ruin various long friendships as a result. I was quite unprepared for what I heard and played the whole thing through three times as soon as I got it in the car (it was a long journey).<br />The title track \\""A Song For The Deaf\\"" is one of the best songs I've ever heard and the spoof girl DJ's introduction to it sends shivers up my back. Other stand-outs are \\""First It Giveth\\"", \\""Go With The Flow\\"", \\""A Song For The Dead\\"" and \\""Millionaire\\"". One hysterical (one minute) moment is \\""Six Shooter\\"" which is how I'd like to behave in front of my customers once in a while.<br />Finally, Dave Grohl needs cloning. He's far too good at everything to live long at this rate.<br />\\""..the sweatest grease, the finest meat...\\"". Songs For The Deaf is the dogs."
759,5,"I can't stop playing it! Even after my children were lulled to sleep, I played it again and again. You are the new and improved Sara McLachlin combined with Linda Ronstadt. I want to buy a CD for everyone I know who is having a baby or has had one. I hope to hear another CD of Grown-up tunes soon.<BR>Your voice is pure Gold! &quot;Bravo&quot;!"
760,5,"Roadhouse Research continues the Texas guitar dynasty of  Smokin' Joe Kubek and Bnois King. On this CD you'll hear the swinging dialogue between the Stratocaster, played by Kubek, and the Gibson 335, played by King. On tracks 6, 7 and 10 we are treated to extended solos by both guitarists. &quot;Standing in My Door,&quot; a slow blues in B flat, is one of the albums prime cuts. At 4:47 of this song, King's solo takes a turn eerliy reminicent of T-Bone Walker's confident jump style. Other highlights include Joe Kubek's graceful yet gritty slide work, and King's unique comping ability, which gives the 12-bar form several layers of depth.<br />BONUS. According the liner notes, this CD features the regaular road band that backs up King and Kubek. What you hear on the CD is what you're likely to hear at a live performance. In other words, what Kubek and King do in the studio, they can do on the road."
761,4,"&quot;Bye, Bye, Bye&quot; is a good song, but I think more attention should be placed on the second track, the unreleased &quot;Could It Be You.&quot; &quot;Could It Be You.&quot; is a throwback to old school R&amp;B music which really works for the group.<br />If you love the song &quot;Bye, Bye, Bye,&quot; definitely buy this cd single, but if you want to hear something a little different, and in many ways better, buy this cd single for &quot;Could It Be You.&quot;"
762,5,"Artie Shaw is,without a doubt one of the best clarinetists of the swing era.His timeless beautiful music will live forever.The classics like &quot;Begin the Beguine&quot; is what really launched his hugely successful career.I am particulary fond of his song &quot;Frenesi&quot; whose clarinet sounds so sweet and lush with a full accompaniment of equally sweet sounding stringed instruments.Once you've listened to the songs by Artie Shaw,you're hooked for life.Bandleaders like him are certainly in a league by themselves that know how to play beautiful music.An excellent collection that any serious Big Band collector<BR>should have!"
763,4,"This Album Rocks! If you don't think so, turn your stereo up and set the EQ right!!!<br />Sure a more live sound would have been better for the Original Steel Dragon songs, but they still rock and this is surely how they would have made the Album Versions if this was made in the 80's!<br />I would love to hear a full album by the guys who made these songs! They would make an awesome live band!"
764,5,When I picked this up I was blown away... lots of old Metallica and Iron Maiden in this band!<br />Pick it up... you will like it.
765,5,I loved TLC in the beginning and I still love them now. The songs in this new CD are all great. I love the way they keep their own style going unlike many other singers out there who change it with the rest of the crowd. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who loves R&amp;B and hip hop. TLC's definitely the best R&amp;B group! Rest in peace Left Eye! I love you!
766,5,"i never really liked Eminem at first, but i really had no idea as to why he was writing this stuff. EVERY song on this album explains how some event in his life has affected him. He bluntly states that it is hard to cope with things (lawsuits, kim, hailey,etc.) but explains how strong he is for getting by. He also states he doesn't care what others think about what he says or does.   i don't know Marshall at all, and i can't say i can relate to him, either. BUT i did take the time to purchase this album and just check out his lyrics. What i don't understand is why his music is considered so controversial. I don't think it is Eminem that has the problem, i think it is the listeners who can't take a few four- letter words here and there, describing an event in a young man's life,(to which they don't agree with).      I DON'T SEE HOW HE COULD POSSIBLY TOP THIS ONE!   I recommend purchasing this album for entertainment purposes only, not to try and go out and imitate/ re-enact what his songs are about. Hey, just let him do the talking, you don't even have to agree with him to like him..."
767,5,"This is the album that so many artists like Zero 7 and Groove Armada have been trying to make, but failed. Back in 1992, Ultramarine produced and released this warm, lush mix of bristling percussion, atmospheric keyboard washes, chiming acidic melodies and folk-ish guitars to an unprepared public. What happened next was a multitude of acclaim for these two gifted producers, with praise from all corners of electronica to folk. Robert Wyatt was a fan and a contributor on later albums.<br />Sadly the duo never seemed to recover from the huge plaudits they got for this album, their later albums being less than what was expected.<br />So this album must be something else, right? Well, I won't disappoint, it is. It's ambient music that you can listen to, relax to and actually have a bit of a groove to. A rare album indeed! It's one of those albums that so many have found influence from, launched their careers trying to emulate it and only succeeded in imitating it. It's a special album, one that I doubt will ever be bettered for a good time to come, if at all.<br />It starts with a relaxing backbeat and percussive track which helps gets you initiated with the Ultramarine sound. Then it's into the Echo and the Bunnymen sampling 'Weird Gear', which is a real treat. Subsequent tracks are all winners, with the delightful 'Stella' a real standout song. Following that is 'British Summertime' both evocative and a beautiful track to listen to. It's a song which brings you back to those warmer summers and incorporated into it is a beautiful rave-type synth backdrop, making for more memories. Imagine a less complicated Boards of Canada. <br />I found the songs 'Saratoga' and 'Lights in my Brain' the only disappointments, but maybe that's just me, some of you may like them! In between them is the Ska-styled 'Geezer', an intensely groovy workout!<br />This has been deleted for years, for some reason, and it took the great LTM label (Darla in the US) to re-issue this classic treasure.Get it now while you can, at a great price too."
768,1,"The Hossam Ramzy track #1 is very good.  The rest are like pop versions of belly dance music, smiley-face versions; some are almost the type of song you expect to find on a childrens educational program.  One cut even had happy hand clapping.<BR> I am not a belly dancer, I was looking for music evocative of that genre, and this is not it."
769,1,"It's sad to say that Whitney's voice is not the same as before. Instead of getting better (if not the same), it gets worst. What happened to her golden voice? There are other great singers like her who maintain their good voice up to now, but not hers. Sorry to say, but she cannot sustain that high notes anymore. I have a CD collection of all Whitney's album but I'm dissappointed with this latest one."
770,3,"When I heard \\""Like I Love You\\"" for the first time, I said to myself this album is gonna be hot. The song is catchy, with its R&B, uptempo sound. When the album hit the charts and sold like hot bread, that made me a beliver more and more that this album was hot. But to tell you the truth, the other songs on the album are a bit lazy and are not as catchy as \\""Like I Love You\\"". They just don't have have that certain beat that I like about a song, weird sounds coming from each song make them sound even worse. ... <br />Justin has a so and so album here. I hope on his second album he doesn't use the \\""Neptunes\\"", they are writing for too many artiste and the songs from different artiste albums are beginning to sound too much alike because of their input on too many songs these days. We need some orginality, not the same song being recycled over and over again. ..."
771,4,"Mariah has made it through the rain.  In the last two albums we began to hear more and more sampling and guest rappers and less and less of Mariah's awesome voice.  Sometimes adversity brings out the best of us and Charmbraclet is one of Mariah's best.  I have not enjoyed a Mariah album this much since her smash hit \\""Daydream\\"".  She has fun, she shares wisdom, and she puts Eminem in his place in the song responding to his song \\""Superman\\"" called \\""Clown\\""...who could want anymore than that?  Mariah is one of those artist you either love or hate, this CD shows Mariah back at the top of her game!!!!!"
772,4,"About two years ago I found a compilation disc with a song titled Soul Vibration as the opening track. It was by a group I'd never heard of called J-Walk. I searched for the album that might include this single, but it was no good. I couldn't find anyone or anything that yet knew about this group. Then I started to read about how this was one of the hottest dance tracks around and I couldn't help but be annoyed by the fact that I still couldn't find more about them. Finally in 2002 I found the album at CDNOW/Amazon and was able to order what I had searched for.<br />The album is worth getting in my opinion simply based on Soul Vibration (slightly altered on the album), but after listening to it you'll find that another single, French Letter is equally as good. These two songs are two of the best I've heard in the ever-growing downtempo or chillout genre. My only reason for not giving this album five stars is that some of the tracks tend to have a more produced sound as opposed to some of the other tracks with rough mixes (that I generally prefer more).  Soul Vibration bounces off the 70's groove tip while French Letter has a more 60's psychedelic feel. The rest of the tracks include guest artists, in which case some are better than others, but if you're into the budding downtempo chillout genre, I strongly recommend this album.<BR> - Stuart"
773,5,"Rage Against the Machine has adopted a new lead singer and a new sound for their first release under the &quot;Audioslave&quot; alias.   Make no mistake: they still rock incredibly hard.  But new singer Chris Cornell has a bit more soul to his voice and fewer political messages to deliver than did Zach de la Rocha.  Cornell's lyrics are emotional and introspective, and his singing ability allows the band to experiment with melody in ways that Rage could not.  &quot;I am the Highway&quot; and &quot;Getaway Car,&quot; for example, are a couple of very melodic and pleasant tunes.  They're also a bit less percussive than the old Rage songs.  But one should not get carried away comparing Audioslave to Rage Against the Machine.  Both bands have a terrific sound.  Audioslave has composed some great rock songs, and they throw in quite a bit of musical experimentation.  For instance, check out the tension-building guitar work at the beginning of &quot;Cochise&quot; and &quot;Set it Off.&quot;  Or check out Cornell's voice work at the very end of &quot;Show Me How to Live.&quot;  It sounds almost middle eastern(?).  Or perhaps Indian?  In any event, this an exciting album, and it's packed with more than an hour's worth of solid music."
774,3,"The CDs are both quite diverse in the music they present, but lack a certain something. Call it consistency, call it progession from one track to the next, I can't quite place it, but something came up missing for me. While some of the tracks are very, VERY good, those that are not worth the time aren't quite paid for by those that are."
775,5,"I'll admit straight off that I'm biased; Jeremy Camp was my next-door neighbour and a good friend when we were kids.  I'm simultaneously proud and jealous of him, to see his career take off like this.  God has really touched Jeremy with the gift of musical evangelism, and He is doing great things through Jeremy.<br />Now on to the critical review part!  In my opinion the three best songs on this CD are \\""Walk by Faith,\\"" \\""I Still Believe,\\"" and \\""One Day at a Time.\\""  \\""Walk by Faith\\"" is one of my personal favourites from his independent release, and it's a simple statement that our life can only be lived through faith.  \\""I Still Believe\\"" actually made me a little teary, because this song was written when Jeremy was facing his wife's death.  \\""One Day at a Time\\"" is a fantastic, guitar-driven song about taking life as it comes.<br />The rest of the album is great, too.  \\""Take My Life\\"" in particular is a great song, very guitar-driven.  The lyrics are all uncompromising in their devotion to and reliance upon God.  Musically speaking, Jeremy's guitar skills are excellent, and the album has a lot of energy.  There are a couple of songs where the sound is slightly reminiscent of Creed.  His voice is powerful and strong, and he uses it well to convey the feeling behind his lyrics.<br />All in all, an excellent CD, and one that no Christian or fan of modern rock should be without!"
776,2,"Sadly, I was very dissappointed with Faith Hill's new cd.  There is not an ounce of country on this album, and it's just nothing special.  Not that I'm not a fan of hip hop, but her country style was just more original and the hip hop thing is just overdone.  Personally, i think she was much better and more successful at the mainstream-but-still-country act, and now she's really &quot;crossed over,&quot; but her hip hop music isn't even that great or catchy.  Compared to her past 2 cd's, this one is a real dissapointment."
777,5,"Disturbed was no surprise to many in the Chicagoland area when &quot;The Sickness&quot; went double platinum. This band built their rep the old-fashioned way, putting on fantastic shows, and great music. Believe is an outstanding follow up to the first disc. The tracks flow well from one to the next. The music itself shows a greater degree of proficiency, and the lyrics, while more ambiguous, carry the intensity of Draiman's emotion and intellect better than the first.  &quot;Rise&quot; is one of the best tracks Disturbed has put out so far. The heavy sound mixed with an almost military beat make the song incredibly infectuous. The CD overall is multidimesional, so there is something for any mood, a quality lacking in &quot;The Sickness&quot; Some might say they've lost their edge because there isn't the same feeling of unadulterated rage, but those people will eventually turn 16, get over it, and realize this is a composition worthy of 5 stars"
778,5,"Buckner's \\""Impasse\\"" is brilliant, simply brilliant. Definitely more mature than Devotion, Bloomed, Since, The Hill, but equally luminous. Makes you wonder why some musicians climb to the top of the charts and others don't, not that it really matters to the rest of us. Buckner's probably the most under rated poet and musician out there.<br />P.S.: And don't forget to read the liner notes: \\""I wish that I could see you now. Call me if you're crawling too\\""."
779,4,"U2 has always been a major band in the music industry with many hit singles and grammy wins.  All That You Can't Leave Behind is another example of an excellent CD that they have managed to pull off.  To start out in the '80s and rise up the charts and still stay popular 20 years later is amazing.  Their newest, most recent CD shows that they still have the talent and stamina to make great, original music.  U2's lyrics are what makes their songs so great alongs with the Edge's guitar and Bono's voice.  They are not real personal in their songs like so many other bands and artists.  They focus on the world, people and abstract qualities.  All That You Can't Leave Behind may be a great CD but it doesn't surpass The Joshua Tree nor The Unforgettable Fire.  U2 is a band that keeps on giving and will not die.  Their music continues to remain popular with adults and has even attracted teenagers.  A.T.Y.C.L.B. seems to hold a more techno/hip-hop allure for the younger crowd.  Just goes to show that U2 is still strong and is as popular as ever!"
780,5,"One of the few things in the world that gets better with age, Tom Petty sounds remarkably fresh in the new album.  There still seems to be plenty of energy on tap, and he is showing no signs of slowing down in my mind, contrary to numerous accusations.  The title track is awesome.  &quot;You and Me&quot; is a great song too."
781,5,"After hearing the first CD, I expected this CD to have nothing but Opera (which was so beautiful on the last CD).  But to my pleasant suprise there were POP standards that I had never heard this way before.  &quot;You are so beautiful&quot;, was more beautiful than any Joe Cocker rendition (which I have always loved), because of the incredibly talented RUSSELL WATSON.  <BR>His rendition of &quot;Somewhere&quot; from West Side Story will leave you with your heart beating and tears welling up in your eyes.  As for the POP/OPERA mix - I didn't expect to be so drawn into the music and voice of this CD, especially after the AWESOME perfomances on his debut CD.  All I can say is... &quot;ENCORE, ENCORE!&quot;  Keep them coming RUSSELL!"
782,5,"I used to go to see Jeffrey Comanor perform at the Drinking Gourd in San Francisco in the early 1970s, and I bought this album in vinyl at that time. It's a great album, and he is a great singer and performer. I've always enjoyed Jeffrey's music tremendously, but didn't know it was available on CD until recently when I found it on the web."
783,5,"THE Band sounds Better than ever here all of the guys are back you can,t replace Kerry no matter how hard you try one of there best cd,s"
784,5,"Nate Dogg was one star, who, as far as releasing an album, got lost in the shuffle. With Death Row's president Suge Knight getting in various troubles with the law, Nate was having trouble getting his album released. This two-disc set, having the first disc recorded in 1995 for Death Row Records and being released in 1996. The second disc is composed of material recorded in 1998 for Nate's currently defunct Dogg Foundation Records. The second disc is actually the better of the two, although the first disc is amazing. Nate Dogg, unlike almost any other in the rap category, sings in the smooth manner of a jazz or blues singer. In fact, a large portion of this album is very jazzy, and shows Nate's roots have always been the blues. His style is more original than anyone else's; he has a voice smoother than glass, and as he often says, you can tell he loves to sing. His smooth voice goes perfectly with the cool production from the likes of Daz Dillinger, Soopafly Priest, Warren G, and many others, including the unlikely production resources of Kurupt, Snoop Doggy Dogg, and even Nate himself, and great guests such as Kurupt, Snoop Doggy Dogg, Warren G, Daz Dillinger, Big Syke, Tupac Shakur, his sister Pamela Hale, and many more for this swinging album.<br />The first disc has many highlights, including the Teddy Riley-produced \\""The Hardest Man In Town\\"", which features another unlikely resource of production, considering Riley's forte is R&B production, and he comes up with a beat that sounds like Daz or Dr. Dre. Nate's beautiful singing rounds the song. The funky \\""G-Funk\\"" features Nate at his best, singing about what the greatest form of hip-hop means to him. \\""First We Pray\\"" features Kurupt, and its soulful guitar beat and great lyrics make it classic Death Row material. The deep production of \\""My World\\"" is amazingly interesting, and Nate's singing flows well over piano and guitars. \\""Crazy, Dangerous\\"" is one of the greatest tracks on the album, produced by Johnny \\""J\\"", whodid tracks for Tupac. The soulful singing and guitar make this a must-listen. The second single, \\""These Days\\"", is classic material with Daz Dillinger putting in a guest rap and Nate Dogg dissing B.G. Knocc Out & Dresta in his smooth \\""I caught you slipping\\"" sort of laid-back GQ demeanor. \\""Bag Of Weed\\"" is a comical track featuring Tray D, and a great, hypnotizing chorus. On another comical side, \\""Dirty Hoe's Draws\\"", Nate joins DJ's and some other great singers including Butch Cassidy and Val Young for a slow jamming track you'll never forget. \\""Scared Of Love\\"" is a jazzy track with a great trumpet and piano, plus Nate singing beautifully. Another classic is \\""Me & My Homies\\"", which features Tupac Shakur, a classic friend song, with smooth keyboards and great lyrics. The swiftly-paced \\""Because I Got A Girl\\"", is classic Nate Dogg, with its funky percussion-laced beat with keyboards and beautiful singing. The first single, \\""Never Leave Me Alone\\"", is another classic song, produced by Kurupt, and featuring the playful rap of Snoop Doggy Dogg over a swinging beat. The prophetic \\""Where Are You Going?\\"" is a slower song that really is great even though it drags out. This disc is great to listen to, especially if you love Death Row, but the second disc is even better.<br />Highlighting tracks on the second disc include \\""Dedication\\"", a short introduction to the album, where Nate disses Death Row's management, angry about the way he was treated there. \\""Who's Playing Games?\\"" is a funky party track (everyone loves DPG in party mode), and \\""I Don't Want To Hurt No More\\"" ticks like a clock with a great beat and Nate's heartfelt lyrics. \\""Just Another Day\\"" is a funky Nate production, and filled with great singing. My favorite is \\""She's Strange\\"", which is a piano and keyboard-laced swing track, featuring Barbara Wilson, who's sultry voice is perfect for the song. \\""Almost In Love\\"" is also a pretty ballad, with a great concept of Nate almost falling in love with a lady until he finds out who she really is. \\""No Matter Where I Go\\"", is a classic Nate Dogg track, filled with organs and lively instruments. \\""Friends\\"" is a 213 reunion, with fellow members Snoop Doggy Dogg and Warren G, for a track about homeboys and a slower beat. \\""Puppy Love\\"", on the other hand, is a party track which features Daz, Snoop Doggy Dogg and Kurupt for a party track. The third single, \\""Nobody Does It Better\\"", is a classic single featuring Warren G, a perfect duet between the two, up there with the classics \\""Regulate\\"" and \\""Annie Mae\\"". Another winner is \\""Sexy Girl\\"", which features keyboards and guitars, plus a great hook and a rap from Big Syke. \\""Dogg Pound Gangstaville\\"", is a classic DPG track with a funky beat and Kurupt and Snoop Doggy Dogg coming in for an appearance. The last track is the great \\""Never Too Late\\"", with it's trumpets and keyboards, a great blues track.<br />To conclude my review, I would recommend this to anyone. Whether you like jazz, blues, rap, hip-hop, soul/R&B, or all, you will love this set. It's for any music lover."
785,5,"AT first, not a big trance fan-but I gotta into oakenfold with some of his songs off the tranceport cd, and i got hooked.  this is the second album of his that i purchased, very, very good.  i like the second cd much better than the first, its darker, deeper, sounds more layered in my opinion.  the thing i like about oakenfold's music is that its varied, between light and hard, and makes for some good study music.  this cd is very good, i highly recommend it.  on the #2 disc, i especially like the blackwatch north sky remix.  the sarah mclachlan remix is really good as well, (never thought i'd be so pumped to hear sarah mclachlan)."
786,5,This soundtrack is the ultimate old school and gangsta rap soundtrack.Its ... awesome. Scarface no tears is the core song of this soundtrack. Scarfaces yrics are bot poetic and just. He and Everyone else on this Album and incredibal.Kool Keith and Biz Markie are great as usual.Office space is a must have soundtrack.Buy it.<BR>
787,5,"Who is that guy?? I guess a lot of fellow Hiatt fans can attest to hearing that over and over again! Is he country? Is he rock? NO joke here.. John has to be probably one of this nation's true gifted singer-songwriters. &quot;Tiki&quot; really rocks out in true fashion, thanks in part to The Goners (Which includes the talented co-guitarist Sonny Landreth) I like this album better than &quot;Crossing Muddy Waters&quot;. My favorite track would have to be the last song on the CD &quot;Farther Stars&quot;, as he get really deep and the song just takes you to another galaxy! True Roots-Rock and Folk musician not disappointing the crowd. On top of this and my review of The Country Bears soundtrack, and seeing John after his concert here in Los Angeles (One of the nicest guys out there folks) Treat yourself to the best of folk-rock and roots music today. Get this album - and see John in concert next year. You will not regret it. Peace - JG &quot;The Bear&quot; that cares about quality music."
788,5,"Song of Solomon is a masterpiece wonderfully put togehter to create an ambiance of love, joy and peace for  Christian singles or married couples.  The ballads are soothing to the soul and the mind and reveal jazzy tempo-like cuts. This CD will surely put that fire in your marriage.  I believe the Lord intended for Song of Solomon to minister to me being that I'm believing his Word for a husband....<br />Wonderful For Couples"
789,5,"Like the previous reviewer, I discovered Ms. Jackson's work at 17 as well. 23 years later, this hardcore fan had to replace all the vinyl recordings on CD simply because the grooves on the records were worn out!<br />This latest outing has Millie on her own label after years of dealing with nonsense from other labels. She has some radio friendly tracks as well as the more explicit work that we have all come to know her for. <br />There isn't a heck of a lot of \\""raps\\"" that the we are used to, as in some of her earlier work, however she lyrically pulls no punches with these tracks, that one can only imagine how she will pull them off \\""live\\"" onstage!   <br />*In My Life* actually has a bit of a goth/trip hop tone to it, while Butt-a-cize has a more decidedly dance floor groove. <br />In addition to great music about growing older (I'm Fifty!) to enjoying being alone (Leave Me Alone), Millie remains steadfast with common sense that provides sanity in an insane world. This is most evident in the closing track (Caught In A Trap) which discusses how we are living too large and simply keeping ourselves down at heal because of the trappings of the world.   <br />Many folks will relate with the breakup song (Trying To Get You Back) which declares the need to send the bad lover back from where they came from. <br />When it comes to quality entertainment about relationships, any Millie Jackson purchase is money that remains well spent. Listening to her can save one years of therepy on a psychiatrists couch because she manages to get to the bone of the matter and doesn't sugar coat it for anyone. <br />I cannot recommend her work highly enough and encourage all those sitting on the fence to give this brilliant performer a shot on your CD player. You might not ever take the CD out!"
790,5,"Now this is definately what I call rock and roll and have been searching for in nineties music. I am a huge Zeppelin fan and when I heard Jimmy Page had once toured with the Black Crowes, I had to check them out. So i picked up this album, The Southern Harmony. Soon as I put it in my CD player I was shocked. This band takes it way back and brings out rock and roll again. I'm hooked on this band. To describe it i would say rock and roll+soul+a southern twist. This band is awesome."
791,5,"In this era of copycat Top 40 lightweight music, monotonous rap,and non-melodic, nihilistic, head-banging noise mascarading as music, all flash in the pans which will never even be remembered in 2-5 years, it's refreshing to hear three highly skilled musicians who have varied musical influences come together and create a sound that demands repeated listening to discover the many layers and intricacies of their artistry. As one who grew up with the great music of the 60's and 70's (and has been looking for decent new music since then, with only a few bands such as The Police, The Cars, Dave Matthews, U-2, etc., making the grade), I truly hope that OMNI will get maximum exposure as this is where I hope that \\""commercial\\"" music will be heading in the future, away from the Britney Spears/Eminem/'N Sync media promoted mundane garbage flooding the music scene today. I highly recommend this CD as I truly believe there is something in it for music afficionados of all ages."
792,5,"The greatest Prog - Rock floyd album ever ..<BR>Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall is nothing compared to this Master Piece of Floyd . <BR>The best track is ofcourse Echoes  , Itz a sweet harmony of emotions - Happiness , Sorrow, Hope , Depression ........<BR>A must have album for anybody who appreciates good music ."
793,4,"This is yet another re-release of the same material we have all heard.  However, it isn't bad.  The second half of the CD is material that was released as 'Red Patent Leather', the sound is pretty sketchy, but it is a good example of later period Dolls, when things were beginning to fall apart.  The first half of the CD is material from something I can't think of right now.  The sound is good, but David's vocals are too high in the mix.  IF you don't have a lot of the bootleg stuff that goes around, this is a good buy.  It does give you an idea of what the Dolls were about live.  If you have a good collection, don't get fooled thinking this is new material like I did."
794,2,If it were not for the two songs being so popular and fun these mixes are very techno and they are more music then song. I don't know why they didn't keep the basic song and build around it. Compliment Gloria. It sounds like the made the noise first and then added Gloria to it later as an after thought.<br />They should have built on her and complimented the already popular song and the arrangement needed more strings and less techno. Not what I was hoping for. Oh well!
795,5,"After releasing the Soft Bulletin it would have been safe to assume that the Flaming Lips had reached the peak of their career.  The album was critically applauded and about as beautiful and orchestrated as pop music can get, which left many believing that the Lips had no more room to advance musically.  Thankfully, they proved us wrong.<br />The music is still as complex as ever, and the tracks are so layered with accoustic guitars, strings, synths and random noises that one can't help but find something new to listen for each time.  Yet two noticeable differences set this album apart from prior Flaming Lips releases.  Most obviously,  'Yoshimi' undeniably has more of a trip-hop feel than its predecessor, but this only adds to it's atmospheric feel and is never distracting.<br />It's the lyrics that set this album apart from the rest, however.  Whereas past releases have found the band singing throwaway silly spacey lyrics, 'Yoshimi's songs actually express a great deal of emotion and vulnerability.  The first single &quot;Do You Realize??&quot; is a sincere, straight forward song about mortality and (who would have thought?) love.  Even on songs less straight forward the listener starts to get the feeling that, for the first time, the robots and weirdness Wayne Coyne are singing about may actually be metaphorical.  <br />Finally, the Flaming Lips have managed to find lyrics as beautiful as their music.  The result is one of the best albums released in years."
796,5,"I have acquired a pretty good collection of Gene Pitney music and I rate this album right up there with the Looking through the &quot;Ultimate collection&quot;. Again it just proves the versatility of Gene Pitney's voice. I especially enjoyed the recordings of when he was Jaime of &quot;Jaime and Jane&quot;. Of his earlier solo recordings, my favorite is &quot;Cradle of my Arms&quot;. I grew up listening to him and I never get tired of his music."
797,4,"I don't know whether to call &quot;Pilgrim&quot; a masterpiece or a dud - it's actually a little bit of both.  Only the first track - the radio hit &quot;My Father's Eyes&quot; - is predictable adult contemporary.  The rest is divided between flashes of such brilliance and periods of such artificial techno drivel that the album as a whole sounds schizophrenic.  &quot;River of Tears&quot; is a moving slow blues, perhaps the best E.C. composition since &quot;Layla.&quot;  And other songs (&quot;Fall Like Rain,&quot; &quot;Sick &amp; Tired&quot;) display all of Eric's classic rock fire.  However, about half of the tracks are virtually ruined by the artificial, electronic production of Simon Climie.  An apparent attempt to sound modern and hip merely sounds misguided and disposable.  You'll probably love parts of &quot;Pilgrim&quot; and hate other parts - but at least you won't be bored."
798,5,"This album has a blender solo. If that frightens you, avoid this at all costs. If you are adventerous or jaded, then buy this and listen to it while you flip through The Wire, thinking deep thoughts. Dose one and Why? from the anticon crew spout abstract wordage all over Odd Nosdam's ethereal, textured, narcotic music.  The sound on this disc is so adventurous, so daring, that many people are angered by it, and refuse to recognise it as hip-hop.  This is not just hip-hop, this is one of the finest hip-hop records ever released.  The 12 tracks were all once each a side on some very limited 10\\"" singles.  Each track runs about 6 or 7 minutes, and often have a few different sections.  It is a very long record, but each piece is well thought out, so it stays interesting.  As strange and experimental as Clouddead is, the production is highly melodic, very beautiful.  It sounds like they tried to make this very lo-fi and dirty sounding.  The production, stream of conciousness lyrics, and the way the songs drift in, out, and into new directions, make these gorgeous songs seem like half-remembered dreams or flashes of a past life.  Rad."
799,5,"I start this review with considerable disadvantage as I have no musical education whatsoever. I have been an afficionado of Ligeti's music since visiting the movie theatre in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1968, as a teenager, and experiencing 2001: A Space Odyssey on an enormous screen. The following day I bought the soundtrack and ever since I have loved his music.<br />You sort of know that you are in trouble when you read the composer's notes which accompany the CD and you feel that you know less than you did before you started reading.<br />This does not detract from the music however. Of all of the modern day composers, Ligeti above all has the ability to create ethereal structures out of sound with regular instruments. His compositions are haunting and assume a life of their own.<br />In this collection, a welcome addition to the current library of recorded works available to the public, the four pieces which the composer has selected originated at various times in his career from the early 1970s through to the mid 1980s. While I would not attempt to classify Ligeti as a member of the minimalist school as his work often defies categorisation, he certainly has been influenced by it and in some ways there are some similarities with Terry Riley's early compositions. Ligeti though, unlike many others is open about his influences and his concern with rhythm he notes is assisted with his listening to world music.<br />Whatever his influences Ligeti creates soundscapes as no other. His work is always a cerebral delight and allows the imagination to flow freely. Listening to this album, and others by this modest genius, one is reminded of science fiction movies where the film makers are able to profuce special effects of lights and ethereal images. Ligeti's music inspires such visions and the listener can experience an almost trancendental experience. This is music for the mind and for the soul because so often it is akin to a spiritual experience.<br />Wonderful and inspirational.tional."
800,5,"Unlike many of those reviewing this wonderful work called &quot;Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band&quot; I'm old enough to have bought it myself and didn't hear this brilliance by way of my brother buying it or being in 7th grade and a neighbor playing it and so on. I was in college as a freshman and although I can't place how I became exposed to August Darnell's great work &quot;Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band&quot; I know I was captivated by it immeadiately and never forgot the record 26 years later.<br />I have never said this about any record but it is an honor to have listened to the genius that this release represents. It's simply a blend of several musical styles--Jazz, R&amp;B, Disco, Melodic Rock and on--played by superb musicians and produced with all the respect an artist can bring for his/her audience.<br />Mr. Darnell has a love of music that is obvious from the dedication he has to his craft that so well appears on this CD. This was not tossed off to make a few bucks as so many artists had done in the 70's and today. The integrity of August Darnell toward his music is present in every single song on &quot;Dr. Buzzard's.&quot; For this release alone the CD is worth the purchase.<br />Cory Daye did a beautiful job singing here and her voice is absolutely breathtaking. When you hear the CD you truly know that it is an honor to have been alive to have heard it and enjoyed it's music with Cory Daye's voice and August Darnell's talent, and a fine band of great musicians bringing it all together.<br />&quot;Dr. Buzzard's Savannah Band&quot; is without a doubt one of the best records of the 1970's and a true example of how beautiful music can be."
801,4,"There are two types of movie sountracks. There's some that are excellent that have a great compilation of good songs. Then there's ones with music that is just terrible. Luckily, the Scooby Doo soundtrack is in the first category. And it's better than the movie, A LOT better. Of course, this soundtrack isn't all good. But it's outweighed by the good stuff. OutKast's song is definently a good one. I'm not a big fan of rap, I like rock mostly, but I like OutKast and this is a really cool song. The MxPx version of the Scooby Doo theme is awesome. I never realized how well that song could be made into a punk song. Another punk band on this CD is Simple Plan. If you like punk at all, you'll like Simple Plan's song. &quot;Grow Up&quot; is a cool song. You might have heard it before in a Six Flags advertisement. This is definently a cool song and if you like &quot;Grow Up&quot; then I reccomend you pick up Simple Plan's CD &quot;No Pads, No Helmets... Just Balls&quot;. MxPx and OutKast CDs are also very good."
802,3,"This is a CD that has grown on me...but I have to admit that when I first got it (based on recommendations here) I couldn't help but wonder if Ralph was on amphetamines (Sorry Ralph!).  He sings some of these songs so FAST.  Having said this, I do like it's upbeat nature, provided I'm not needing my children to go to sleep anytime in the near future.  My kids are only 2 1/2 years and 9 months, so maybe when they're a little older we'll appreciate this more."
803,5,I bought this cd the very first day that it came out then I went home and listened to it and after &quot;here to stay&quot; I realized that this was the defenite #1 cd of 2002. So go out and buy it yourself and find out. You won't be dissapointed.
804,5,"This is one of the most under-rated albums of the 70s, if not of the entire rock era. &quot;Crying to the Sky&quot; is a classic. &quot;Fair Exchange&quot; and &quot;Life in the Air Age&quot; are also standouts. But the playing on this album is amazing. Most of the cuts are very strong. I just replaced my vinyl copy with the import CD. The sound quality seems pretty good. It's great to have this album on CD. Finally!"
805,5,"For a CD with 2 long discs, it's amazing (for me) that I found about 80% of it to be outstanding. This is very involved, mesmerizing trance, not anthemic nor super \\""deep.\\"" If you prefer euphoric, song-like trance or the deeper, darker, bass-heavy sounds of DJ's like Seb Fontaine and Jerry Bonham, this probably isn't for you. But that's part of why I like Seaman's track selection: I go for highly engaging and rhythmically complex sounds with interwoven instrumentals that give you plenty of different sounds to focus on at any one time. As for Seaman's mixing, it's phenomenal. He takes you on a journey and it's hard to tell sometimes where one track ands and the next begins.<br />It's interesting to read others complaining of the vocals on One of The People, because I can understand that point of view but I find them deliciously strange and haunting, and GREAT to sing along with LOUDLY with the windows rolled down. In fact a lot of this CD is haunting or just downright [rocks], it gets me dancing in my car like a complete idiot and enhances whatever I'm looking at or thinking about. I do NOT recommend playing this casually or just checking out a couple of tunes, this is very involved music and it gets better when you give it a lot of space and time to get inside your head... and high volume helps, of course! If you like this then check out Armin Van Buuren's incredible trio of double-disc CD's (001 thru 003)."
806,5,"This is perhaps a more guitar-oriented album than most other Cocteau Twins albums; the roaring gothic guitar lines of Robin Guthrie dominate the soundscape, but without displacing Liz Frazer's deadly vocal stylings, which seem more sweet on most future releases. It's a chilling, very gothic piece of work. Though their first lp, it reveals a different side of the Twins' music.<br />\\""Garlands\\"" came out in 1982, so it belongs to a scene and an aesthetic very different from the one that the Twins belonged to in the mid-80s. Think of Joy Division, Lydia Lunch, or early Siouxsie and the Banshees. The mid-80s indie and alternative scene, or at least the part of it that the Twins identified with most, was less intensely morbid or dark than the dense post-punk that had preceded it; so that a later Twins album like Treasure has a certain aesthetic identification with New Order or the Smiths. In fact, the change that the Cocteau Twins underwent mirrors the one by which Joy Division morphed into New Order. It was actually a very good thing that the aesthetics changed, but on \\""Garlands\\"", you can hear a band that easily holds its own with (and even surpasses) something like \\""Pornography\\""-era Cure."
807,5,"After reading the book &quot;Surfing the Himalayas:, this CD brought me to the tops of the Himalayas where I felt refreshed and uplifted.  Put it in your CD and leave it there..."
808,5,"This album is great, my favourite song is hold on to love. Where is Maarja now, she was suppose to release her new album city life, is she releasing it in Europe, is she can to promote it in the uk, does anyone know is there a website. please tell me anyone."
809,5,"Ginny Owens first burst onto the scene in 1999 with &quot;Without Condition.&quot;  The depth and honesty of her lyrics combined with her voice and music earned her the Dove for New Artist of the Year and quickly made her one of my favorite artists.  This is her first CD since her debut, and it was well worth the wait.<br />It opens with &quot;Prelude.&quot;  I was expecting a nice soft piano piece or maybe a hymn intro like her last CD.  But instead it's a quick little song that sets the stage for the rest of the CD.  She shares that she set out to share her faith, but life forced her to step back and recommit to God.  The rest of the CD flows out of this premise.<br />&quot;With Me&quot; is a fun, upbeat track focusing on the fact that God is with us no matter what is going on in the world around us.  It's simple, but there are days when I need to remember the simple things.<br />&quot;I Am&quot; takes the stories of Moses, David, and Mary to remind us that God is the one that works through us in spite of our weakness.<br />&quot;Simply Love You&quot; really hit me hard.  It's a prayer to return to our first love for God, something that I need to be constantly reminded to seek.  Along those lines, &quot;All I Want to Do&quot; is a simple prayer of rededication to God.<br />Style wise, this album is a bit more pop oriented then her first one was, but it has really lost none of the flavor of the first and still includes some soft piano ballads.  It took a listen or two for me to get used to the new sound on a couple songs, but now I'm thoroughly enjoying them.<br />I have been listening to this CD almost constantly since I got it, and I'm still catching new things in the songs.  There isn't a weak song to be found, and I am sure I will be enjoying it for many years to come.  Buy it today and enjoy one of the best female artists in Christian music today."
810,1,"I don't know much about Latin music, but I really enjoy listening and dancing to it.  I had heard of La Bomba (the hit), so I took a risk and bought the album.  I was really disappointed with the tracks. Most sound like tacky repeative songs played at huge discotheques in the summer, with a few farts noises thrown in!  <BR>I guess that's what you get if you buy an album for a popular song heard over the summer, and even La Bomba is wearing thin..."
811,2,"i could go on forever about how much this album isn't as good as the studio version, but i will just say that<BR>a : if you want it live, is there anybody out there?<BR>b : the happiest days of our lives doesn't flow very much, unlike the album and (earls court) live version.<BR>c: van halen doesn't sound like gilmour, and shouldn't try to.<br />thank you very much."
812,5,"I have had and loved this album for years, but it took on a whole other dimension for me when I realized how much our infant daughter loves it.  When she wakes up screaming from nightmares, I put the Daemon Lover in the CD player, turn up the volume, and within seconds she is calm and relaxed.  At night she goes to sleep by traditional, soothing balads like The Ash Grove, which is a beautiful song.  This album has an effect on her like no other!<br />Not just for babies, though, The Daemon lover is magic for adults as well.  Ms. LaRue's voice is pure sunlight, and I strongly disagree with the reviewer who said the recording is feeble.  As a matter of fact, I used it as a reference recording when purchasing a new amplifier several years ago.  The soundstage is broad and the vocals are clear as glass.  Highly recommended for audiophiles."
813,5,"having never been a fan of teen sensations { donny osmond, lief garrison, et al } i cannot convey the amasement i feel of not only liking this CD but being totally engrossed in the songs. after seeing her story on Behind the Music you can understand the<br />the message behind each song...even the ones she didn't help write. it is a strong, mature record with a great pop sensibility that is intelligent without being pretentious. i had already bought the original release but lost it in a car wreck. so bought this one. the added songs a nice but not quite in the same league as the first 13 tracks. if you listen to this CD without any preconcieved notions you will be richly rewarded."
814,5,"I really think that this album is an undiscovered gem in the realm of rock. This could be the CRUE'S finest piece of work to date and it was not a success. Every band member sounds great, including John Corabi, who doesn't receive the credit that he deserves. The standout tracks on this album are Hooligan's Holiday, Misunderstood, loveshine, Smoke The Sky, Droppin' like flies and Drift Away."
815,5,"OUTSTANDING in EVERY way! <br />The performance Mr. Florez gave in his debut season at the MET, is worthy of everyone's undivided attention. To say that it might go down on record, as probably one of, if not the best sung and acted Count Almaviva in the MET's 100+ year history, might sound like an overstatement. <br />I assure you it's not.<br />Stunning coloratura technique. Accurate intonation. Innate musicality. An effortless and unyielding supply of high B's and C's. A pleasant, golden tone that develops ping the higher it goes.  Assured, multi-layered comedic acting that stopped the show without any singing involved. An expressive and quite handsome face. An athletic body and the ability to make the audience &quot;adopt&quot; him without even trying. <br />All this would be wonderful in itself, even if he didn't throw in the fiendishly difficult, rarely performed, &quot;Non piu resistere&quot; in the final moments of the opera.<br />Mr. Florez tossed it off as if it were &quot;Caro mio ben&quot;.<br />The house went berserk! I went berserk!<BR> <BR>How were the rest of the singers you may ask? Were there any? I can't remember.<br />The CD is even more astonishing. This man is a wonder!"
816,5,One of the best cd's I have purchased! Great tunes from many artists.
817,5,"I have searched worldwide to obtain a copy of Orchid by Phil Sheeran and when i've found the source they will not ship! Can anyone help as I would be prepared to pay the shipping costs if that's the problem.If it will help I am happy to order other albums to make it more commercially viable.<br />Regards,<BR>Steve Hearn"
818,5,I have been a fan of Russ Freeman since the inception of the Rippingtons long ago. This group and the music that they write just gets better and better! This is a must for your collection! Check out the title track!
819,5,"I saw the flamekats at a show in Lincoln and was blown away by how much this band rocks.  Yes, the cd is great and sounds good but it is nothing compared to the live show where they play a great variety of music.  I am like many people a fan at first site, keep rockin' flamekats!"
820,5,"had this album in 1962 ,lost it and could not find it until now  awesome tunes"
821,3,"The Orchestral Arrangement for &quot; Toccata &amp; Fugue in D minor &quot; is my favourite. Highly recommended for those who want to enjoy a different approach to this piece. Incidentally, you might want to listen to his arrangement of the same piece in his &quot; Sayonara Concert - live in Osaka Festival Hall &quot; available on VCD and DVD.<BR>Check out also Walter Murphy's arrangement for the same piece."
822,5,"Beautiful, hauntingly lovely songs....let the visions come...I always &quot;see&quot; when this CD is playing. Buy it in HONOR of the great Native Americans of this land and let your spirit be moved. It is fabulous!"
823,5,"It used to be Billy Joel.  He told stories and forced you to listen with the power of his hooks.  Now it's Ben Folds.  If ROCKIN' THE SUBURBS proves nothing else, it proves that he is today's master storyteller.  This album is nothing less than a masterful tapestry of tales, a photo gallery of very human snapshots of pain, loss and happiness.  From the first notes of &quot;Annie Waits&quot; which opens the album, to the sad and tender last whispers of &quot;The Luckiest&quot; which closes it, this will rank as one of the best albums of its time, I have no doubt.  I have almost worn it out with repeated listening and still find new things to admire with every spin.<br />Don't miss out.  This is the best pop album of the year."
824,5,"Yes, this album is different than Felons.  However, it has the same bone crunching riffs and raw emotion that you heard on the band's debut. It also possesses a certain maturity and a wide variety of musical styles.  This sophomore effort shows Dope stretching out.  Life is about experiencing.  Life is about seeing what you can and cannot do.  And most of all, Life is about moving forward and not looking back!!!!  Dope RULES!!!!!"
825,5,"could somebody tell me what this album is? is it really by the incubus of &quot;morning view&quot; and &quot;make yourself&quot; fame?  if so, what songs are on it?"
826,5,"Many fans and music critics seem to agree that Frank Sinatra's years with Capitol (1953-61) represent the zenith of his recording career.<br />Sinatra's Capitol output divided itself nicely into two distinct entities: the legendary albums (Only The Lonely, Songs For Swingin Lovers, Come Fly With Me et al) and the quick 2 and a half to 3 minute shots at hitting the top 40.<br />While Sinatra oversaw every aspect of his albums, he had a staff of song pluggers and Capitol A&amp;R men helping to choose the singles material.<br />The quality of the singles varied greatly-- from the ultra hip &quot;Witchcraft,&quot; to the seductive &quot;Talk To Me&quot; right through Frank's only  (thank goodness) attempt at the rock market:<BR>&quot;Two Hearts--Two Kisses&quot;<br />In this sensational box set, Capitol has issued every commercial Capitol single recorded by Sinatra over a 7 year span.<br />Though the quality of the material varies, Sinatra's performances remain uniformly superb....he sings &quot;Ol Mac Donald&quot; with the same energy and conviction as he demonstates on &quot;Witchcraft&quot; and &quot;Nice N Easy.&quot;<br />Though he occasionally experimented with different arrangers for his singles output, the vast majority of the material was arranged by the twin geniuses: Billy May and Nelson Riddle.<br />Capitol has outdone itself with his box...the mastering of the original material is superb and the booklet by Will Friedwald (from whom I lifted the title of this review) is filled with sensational anecdotes and some hip inside references.<br />Owning this package and the Complete Reprise Studio Recordings from Warner Brothers is like having a Mercedes and a Rolls in the same garage.<br />The man was the finest popular singer of our time."
827,5,"&quot;Bailin' out the door on my way to the liquor store.&quot;  Young Bleed spins yarns of reality.  He is without a doubt the best product of the No Limit Camp.  My Balls and My Word is a title that exemplifies the neccessites of a true player.  Take away the expensive cars, flashy women, golden teeth, and green Gators, and what is a man left with.  That's right, his courage and his word.  The beats groove, but the lyrics are the draw.  More than simple rhymes, the songs on this album promote thought.  Young Bleed Corleone, as he calls himself, speaks of the world in all its glory and ugliness.  In the end one feels as though a portrait of not only ghetto lifestyle, but the lifestyle of anyone who has worked hard to get ahead, has been vividly protrayed right in front of them.  This album is not for the weak.  Only the real should listen."
828,4,"&quot;Surrealistic Pillow&quot; is one of the 1960's albums that never seems to grow tired. With each listening, there seems to be a verse or a sound that resonates with current events. The Grace Slick classic &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; ignites the album and still sounds fresh and fiery. The hypnotic &quot;Today&quot; is one of the lesser-known tracks but Marty Balin's lead vocal is perfectly suited to the psychedelic music. The instrumental &quot;Embryonic Journey&quot; does'nt hold up as well but the next track, &quot;White Rabbit&quot; is the highlight of the album. Grace Slick's powerful, relentless vocal builds atop the bass and guitar chords to a screaming climax. The only flaw of this album -  and it is major - ithe sound quality. There is notable suppression  and hiss. A Remaster is sorely needed."
829,1,"I bought this hoping to hear re-workings of the originals, but instead found attempts to mostly re-create the songs note-for-note. The only real exception is Robert Berry's version of &quot;Roundabout&quot;. He actually took some time and re-composed this song, and the result is a completely different yet interesting version.<br />I find the rest of this CD to be embarrassingly painful to listen to, and recommend that you surf swiftly past it. My only comfort is listening to the originals after putting this CD on. Similar to the good feeling you get after ceasing to hit yourself in the head with a hammer.<br />You're right-I didn't like this one."
830,5,"DJ Dean has again demonstrated his mastery of hard, German, progressive trance.  From the start of the first song on the first disc right through the last downbeat on the second disc, DJ Dean has you at his mercy.  With his heart attack inducing trance beats, euphoric drops, and heartwrenchingly beautiful melodies he will have you counting down the days until Tunnel Trance Force 19 is released."
831,5,"I feel this is one of Gene Watson's best yet. Folks, I have them all!!. It's been a long time coming, but it was worth the wait.There is not one song on it, I didn't like. As a long time fan, I recommend this to others, fans or not. He is so underrated as a singer, but he's still # one. It's a must for all country music fans."
832,5,"Throwing Copper is the best album ever written, by anyone.  There's not a single track that isn't fantastic.  Kowalcyk's melodies are amazing, and his lyrics are deep and meaningful, but not too preachy.  Songs range from the slow and thoughtful &quot;Pillars of Davidson&quot;, to the hard, fast paced &quot;Stage&quot;.  And of course this albums delivers classics like &quot;Lightning Crashes&quot;, &quot;I Alone&quot;, &quot;Selling The Drama&quot;, and &quot;All Over You&quot;.  A must have for any music fan"
833,5,"The Cars &quot;Door to Door&quot; is a classic example of a underrated rock album. Some of the critics obviously didn't get it however, fans and critics who know The Cars albums back to the beginning in '78 understand that &quot;Door to Door&quot; is an exellent very diverse album covering many music styles from the rocking &quot;Strap Me In&quot; and pop sounding &quot;You Are the Girl&quot; to the punk sounding title track &quot;Door to Door&quot; down to the softer sound of &quot;Comming Up You&quot; sung by Ben Orr. All of the songs are done with a true reflection of The Cars styles of previous albums while also showing a more mature sound. Producer Ric Ocasek does a great job in keeping the album sounding consistent, strong and not overly Produced. &quot;Door to Door&quot; is highly recommended and a superb foll-up to the very successful &quot;Heartbeat City&quot;. A great ending to The Cars studio albums!"
834,5,"Being a big Powerpuff fan I purchased this album just to add to my growing collection of memorabilia. I thought for sure it would just have &quot;kiddie tunes&quot; and I would only listen to it only a couple of times.<br />Boy, was I wrong! This album rocks, straight out of the gate with Devo's &quot;Go Monkey Go&quot; (I was a big Devo fan back in the day). Shonen Knife's &quot;Buttercup: I'm a Super Girl&quot; motivated me to check out their albums (I now own all of the US releases). All of the songs are good, and are fitting for the audio storyline.<br />I also really dig the album graphics. This CD is a real gem and a must for any Powerpuff fan."
835,5,If you really want an idea how sweet roc raida is get ahold of one of his videos such as &quot;the adventures of grandmaster roc raida.&quot;  he is so full of body tricks and other goodies that the music is only half of his skill
836,5,"&quot;Hey, where are Pachebel's Cannon and Bach's Air?&quot;<br />They're not &quot;Largo&quot; movements and when Naxos says &quot;Largo&quot; they mean it, delivering 20 &quot;Largo&quot; movements (75 minutes) from the Baroque era. And while those two famous works are missing there is more than enough familiar and delightful music compiled here to make for a wonderful sampler. Casual classical fans will immediately recognize Handel's Largo from &quot;Serse&quot; as well as the movements from Vivaldi's Guitar Concerto, Flautino Concerto, and &quot;Winter&quot; from the Four Seasons. Other delights include movements from Bach's Piano Concerto in F Minor (played on a piano, rather than the harpsicord you would expect, to great effect) and Double Concerto in D Minor. <br />The performances and quality of the recordings from which these selections have been compiled are all first rate. If you enjoy relaxing to baroque then this disc is for you."
837,4,"Blueprint--no doubt--is some of Jay's better work. The beats are pretty tight for the most part. Out of 13 joints---3 cuts I just can't stand--and the others are pretty much on point and worth listening to. I'm feelin' &quot;Girls, Girls, Girls&quot;--the beat change-up is bangin', &quot;Song Cry&quot; is nice, and &quot;Blueprint&quot; is hot. Well worth buying---Jay-Z..........arrogance at its finest."
838,5,"This is one of those albums that never gets old. This album was first given to me by my cousin about 8 or 9 years ago, and I've loved it ever since. It was my first taste of Maiden, and now they are one of my all-time faves. And, this is one of their best albums. It all starts off with &quot;Aces High&quot; (one of the hardest songs of all time to play on guitar), and never misses a step after that. I mean, the great songs just keep coming, one after the other. The epic &quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; is just great. Not quite on the level with some of Dream Theater's 10+ minute monsters, but it still holds your attention from beginning to end. I also recommend reading the poem this song is based on. It's really cool. There's just not enough I could say about this album. The guitar solos are superfast, and Bruce Dickinson's vocals almost shatter glass (I mean that in a good way!). This is the second best album of the 80's (right behind Queensryche's &quot;Operation Mindcrime&quot;), and one of the best albums of all time. If you love rock, metal, polka, whatever, you need to buy this. Also check out the new album, &quot;Brave New World&quot;, which is more progressive and melodic, a lot like Dream Theater, truely amazing, but anything by Maiden is great. Real metal will never die as long as these guys are still around. UP THE IRONS!!!"
839,4,"By now, most know the story of AAF - a pact with friends from the California scene, Papa Roach, that whoever got famous first would give the other a hand. Thus Anthology, the band's major label debut on Papa Roach's New Noize label, is born. To my ears, the fact that they are close friends is where their ties pretty much end. Perhaps you could pin them with the dreaded 'new-metal' tag, but I hear a lot going on here, and my hopes for their future are bright. Strong drumming, creative, and sometimes approriately dissonant guitar, as well as a highly melodic, sometimes guitar-like bass make up the music of this album. The musicians cover several bases, from the blistering, jagged-edge riffing to softer, cleaner passages. All of this is complemented by a singer who, in my opinion, is yet another stand out vocalist in the new-metal category, as he sounds like he can actually sing. This is what stopped them from getting 5 stars, in my opinion. Much like the grunge bands many reviewers compare these four musicians to, there is a resemblance to another singer that is just a bit too uncanny for me. That would by to Chino from the deftones. In fact, the song 'Universe' seems to parallel 'Mascara' from 'Around the Fur', while the guitarwork in general resembles Stephen Carpenter's playing on the deftones' debut, 'Adrenaline.' All in all, this is a talented band that should only continue to develop their own sound, which I guess would eventually be devoid of some of their more obvious influences. This is a solid cd, and musicians especially will revel in the obvious talent of the members of this band."
840,5,"if gram parsons had recorded an album in 1997, it might have turned out quite similar to whiskeytown's &quot;strangers almanac.&quot;  aside from the decidedly 90s-style studio tricks that are sprinkled throughout the record's thirteen tracks, the countrified singer/songwriter style is what shines through.  yes ryan adams tends to get a lot of hype, but most of it is well deserved.  charisma, strong lyrics, and a natural understanding of the intangibles that make great music will do that.  whiskeytown may upset the country purists because of the distinctive rock influences, namely on &quot;16 days&quot; and &quot;yesterday's news&quot;, but it's just a continuation of parsons' blurring of musical boundaries.  &quot;inn town&quot; is a beautiful opener - subtle and emotional, and it's followed by the aching &quot;excuse me while i break my own heart tonight&quot; which seems too short but is arguably the strongest track here.  the quieter moments are the album's gems, with &quot;everything i do&quot;, &quot;avenues&quot;, and &quot;dancing with women at the bar&quot; standing out, though &quot;waiting to derail&quot;, a uncharacteristic yet effective rocker that has an emo-punk edge to it is strong as well.  alcohol is a major theme throughout the album, and though it's easy to find fault in adams' characters (himself included of course) for their drunken finger-pointing, he manages to come off as sincere and regretful, if only for a second, and that makes him endearingly human.  many music critics point to wilco's &quot;being there&quot; as the definitive 90s &quot;alt-country-rock&quot; record, and while that record is easily as strong as &quot;strangers almanac&quot;, it's clear that wilco was steering away from its country roots, whereas whiskeytown unabashedly embraces them here.  credit adams and caitlin cary for that.  a must for any modern country-rock fan."
841,5,"If more Eddie Harris albums sounded like this, he would rate higher in the jazz pantheon.  I'm not a big Harris fan, but this recording works from start to finish.  The highlight for me is the interpretation of Mr. Hagen's 'Harlem Nocturne' -- better than the writer's own version that I bought on a '45' when I was in junior high school.  But while most Harris albums have at most one or two tunes that stand out (or none), &quot;There Was A Time&quot; is a very solid effort, from song selection to performance.  Most recording artists never make an album this good -- but I would have called Stan Getz, Art Pepper or John Coltrane a &quot;jazz musician&quot; without thinking about it, not a &quot;recording artist,&quot; which is probably a statement by my inner jazz critic."
842,4,"This is a must have for any and all Xena fans.  Ides of March and Fallen Angel is some of Lo Duca's best music.  However, this doesn't include many of the songs that &quot;die hard&quot; fans were looking for.  It is missing the song that MiLila sang on Destiny and some of the indigenous religious type songs used in the episodes with Eli.  It's also missing the music from &quot;The Conqueror&quot; with Najara.  So what happened?  We don't know.  And they added &quot;Joxer the Mighty&quot; and the main theme.  Why?  They are on the first 2 CDs.  I wonder if they are going to come out with another CD; Xena - the lost songs.  In the meantime, I guess we'll just have to settle for what we have on 6 CDs and tape the rest directly from video."
843,5,"In addition to the so eloquent aforementioned explanation of the contents this disk, may I submit the following :<br />I have played this recording at various parties just to see who notices the sour notes and rythmic blunders.  Some people &quot;get it&quot; and others just wonder what's so funny about it.  If you're somebody who appreciates parody and you aren't tone deaf - you are sure to like this silliness (and, be sure, it rates HIGHLY on the Silly Scale). <br />If you don't meet the above suggestions... then don't waste your time.<br />ps. it's A LOT more entertaining after a drink or two..."
844,5,a  wondeful voice combine with the instruments make you feel sensible and easy going. I love all songs of this album.
845,3,"Fact:  Frank Black will never satisfy diehard Pixies fans that are constantly expecting him to make another Doolittle or Surfer Rosa.  Therefore, we can only accept that the old legend is exploring new territories, a long way from anything the Pixies made.  In my opinion, Dog in the Sand is Blacks second best solo effort to date, not quite as good as Teenager of the year, but to be fair, these two records dont sound anything alike.  I got extremely excited when I read somewhere that Blacks new album was record live on 2track.  I was expecting something raw and exciting.  Surprisingly though, Dog in the Sand sounds like something out of a five star recording studio, which is fitting to the feel-good melodies on the album.  Although the songs pretty much sound the same, Blacks brilliant songwriting occasionally rises with excellent tracks such as &quot;Bullit&quot; and &quot;St. Francis Dam Disaster&quot;.  Overall though, Dog in the Sand sounds a bit too nice, it just kind of flows steadily.  As always, the lyrics are way above average which is a rare commodity in the music business today.  The Pixies are dead, but Frank keeps making decent music.  I doubt hell ever again make anything close to being as good as the Pixies albums.  Hes simply doing new things."
846,5,This is a excellent song off Fragma's new cd &quot;Toca&quot;. If you thought &quot;Toca's Miracle&quot; was good then try this one out as well. You'll be happy you bought it!
847,5,"The release of \\""The Division Bell\\"" was one of the most significant event in PF's history. I've listened to many of their albums which I disliked at all while \\""DB\\"" makes me feeling smth like being on the top of the world. The album combines musical pieces appropriate for almost the all feelings people have - from sadness (\\""Marooned\\"", \\""Wearing the Inside Out\\"") to melancholy (\\""A Great Day for Freedom\\"") to full of desire of life (\\""Take It Back\\"", \\""Coming Back to Life\\"") and at last futuristic, enigmatic state of your soul (\\""Keep Talking\\"", High Hopes\\""). David Gilmour has fabulous voice which suits this music just right. The blending of the songs is great, too; it's made not worse than Enigma does. And there's no better way to imagine yourself being somewhere in the foggy Albion accompanies you during the whole \\""ball of sounds\\""!<br />It's strange to me why this album is still, after 7 years, under severe debates, dividing those who listen to it either to haters or to firm admirers. Still, I agree that The Division Bell has its right to be named as one of the most mystical and at the same time the most enchanting album Pink Ployd has ever made!"
848,4,Heard this on a wonderful Sunday afternoon dancing and people watching in 'The Cafe' at Castro and Market (SF) and knew I had to have it- its sexy beat make you wanna get it on slowly....DJ blended it in with BenWatt's Sade mix- by your side...what a day...this brings it all back!
849,5,Yep.<br />Better than Slint. Better than Shellac. Better than Tortoise. Etc.<br />This is THE Indie album of the 90's.<br />--Seth
850,5,"A friend gave me a CD of contemporary Hawaiian music as a gift. When I thanked him, he told me a little about HAPA. &quot;HAPA?&quot; I asked him. He had given me the wrong CD so I ordered the HAPA CD that he intended to give.  I became a fan when I listened to the first song, &quot;Haleakala Ku&quot;.  The songwriting amd musical talents of Barry Flanagan mesmerize me.  This CD lifts my spirits when I'm in a bad mood, it relaxes me if I'm keyed-up.  I now have all of HAPA's CD's and there is one playing constantly in my home or car CD player."
851,3,"I have listened to this CD only once (Just bought it yesterday). I was quite enthusiastic to buy it. However, to be honest I was a bit disappointed by the product. Some tracks on the CD are great but for most part of it this CD is more &quot;typical house&quot; than dark trance or deep house. Seaman has done an excellent job on all of his last compilations including Awakening; Buenous Aires and Cape Town. However, compared to his earlier works this CD falls short. The mixing is not that seamless either. There is too much overlap and the transitions are not impressive. In my opinion this CD falls under the same category as what Oakenfold did in his &quot;Travel&quot; series. Pretty average."
852,5,Had this on tape for years. Had to get the CD for the improvement in quality. The only show that comes close to this was a few days later at MIT. This show has the best &quot;Other One&quot; you will ever hear. Garcia was great during this tour. If you want to hear the Dead at their best with Pigpen (pre 71) buy this CD!
853,5,"This is an awesome CD-I never saw Popstars only cuz I don't have the WB but when I first heard Get Over Yourself I couldn't wait to get the album and listen to it everyday (NOT JOKING)in fact I am listening to it right now. I am listening to a song that is not even listed on the album it is like a bonus song called Promise Me or something like that, it is my favorite song besides Get Over Yourself. Eden's Crush are awesome and can really sing. Just because they are &quot;TV Made&quot; doesn't mean anything, they worked thier butts off to get where they are today and I wish them all the luck and good fortune in the furture. (mrsdrewlachey9169@hotmail.com)"
854,4,"The number one song that sold me this cd was 'Ain't Nothin' bout you'.  This song says it all to a person who has experienced that kind of love. The rest of the cd was pure frosting on the cake.  I have enjoyed Brooks &amp; Dunn for several years now, and this I think is their best work yet! Buy it, you'll love it!<br />Karen Jean"
855,5,Saga Begins is on the front of starting a new Hip Hop era  year 2K1 in effect. It's the bomb mix of Hardcore and Funky laidback tracks.
856,5,it's a 2 cd greatest hits. good for any music lover. if you don't own any of thorogood's cd's this is the best one to buy.
857,5,"A mere five star rating is a hopelessly limp evlauation of Duffy's tour de funk.  If you are not excited to the point of nausea by 'Way Out Here', you are a corpse.  Sit back and allow yourself to be devoured whole and and spat out only to be eaten again by its insatiable groove. <br />Buy this album or your friends will consider you the very soul of ennui."
858,5,"This album is my most prized music possesion. Its the most original and mind-blowing thing, i think, that has ever been recorded. The first song, Rascuache, gets you in the mindset for the rest of the album, and then when it all boils down, the &quot;sad&quot; song of the album, 198d blows you away. <br />A MUST have for any ATDI fan, no question."
859,4,"Only Rock'n Roll could be this fun, and the simple fact that it comes so pure from a group obviously detached from the English sphere, is a testemant to the strength and vitality it still has left. When you listen to Rumble for the first time, your immediately struck, &quot;Hey Johnny Thunders did that&quot;, &quot;the Jam sounded like that...&quot;, &quot;Sounds a bit like Television there...&quot;, this is pure mod/garage/noise/early-punk here, nothing technically new, or amazing.  Their strength comes from their ability to walk the fine line between homage and indulgence, taking the best from all of rock's early abandoned schools. Or, maybe, these styles found them, I mean, one look at a photo of the band, and your in awe of the glow of a laconic cool that hasn't been seen in the U.S. since sun-era Elvis... <br />Anyway, I ramble, if you want a genuine good time, and a nice sampler (this is a compilation, not original album) of what is sure to be an underground sensation, give this a shot."
860,4,"This &quot;opera&quot; is really an oratorio.  The characters do no more than stand around and sing, even the famous hair cutting is done off-stage.  Here the two name characters are American--Verrett is at the top of her form and sings all of Dalila's music sensuously and with wonderful tone.  This was long before Cassily  was dumb enough to undertake Tannhauser for the Met, and he too sounds very good.  If, in the end, this is not a totally satisfying performance, it is lacking because the opera itself  is static and offers only fleeting moments of real satisfaction.  Worth having for Verrett and Cassily singing so well, but my  regret is that M. San-Saens didn't reworkd the whole thing and try to juice this opera up a little."
861,4,"For real this kid is nice. The production done by Phatboy is tight, and simple so that you can pay ample attention to Esau's lyrics, which are funny at times, but alway on point. No one ever thought there would be a tight emcee from North Carolina, but here he is....cop it."
862,5,"This self titled disc from Weezer came out in 1994. I was all of fourteen years old, nieve about music, but this one quickly became a favorite of mine. I had the cassete tape, and literally wore it out from listening to it every day. Now with technology being what it is, i have the CD and it gets the same amount of playtime in my house. <br />The true beauty with Weezer is that they take simple beats and melodies and turn them into something that is so much more. There is of course the guitar solos that make geek rock what it is, but there is some sort of a hidden draw to this music that is hard to explain. This is one disc that i can put in and i have to listen to the whole thing, it seems like a crime to not listen to cetain songs. The definate standouts on this disc are &quot;My Name is Jonas&quot;, &quot;Say it Ain't So&quot;, and the radio friendly &quot;Buddy Holly&quot;. Anyone that calls Weezer a one hit wonder deserves to be kicked in the shins and laughed at on national television. This is a CD that will go down in rock history."
863,5,"The very best DJs are the ones who have the uncanny ability to move seamlessly across both time and musical genres.  With Tyrant, Craig Richards &amp; Lee Burridge prove ready to take their place with the best of them.<br />The first disc begins with a brief introduction warning the listener about commercialism, and swifly moves on to Peter Dildo's Physical 2000, a throbbing (pardon the pun here) little breakbeat number which sets the tone for 72 minutes or so.  West coast producers of the moment, Halo Varga and Hipp-e make appearances, with Halo Varga's tribal workout Future and H-Foundation's Hear Dis Sound while breakbeat dons Mike &amp; Charlie get feet moving with I Get Live.  Disc 1 ends on a smooth house note, with tracks by DJ Foxx and the Darkhouse Family.<br />Disc 2 starts on a slice of vocoder deliciousness, with Illumination's Perfect Sky, and it's a steady build, with bumping basslines, heavy beats, few vocals and tweaky effects. Standout songs by DJ Garth, Bluegoose vs. Silverlining, tech-house gurus Circulation and Jerome Pacman keep heads bouncing, while classics like Freaky Chakra's Hallucifuge are evidence that a great song never really goes out of style.  <br />Both discs are an eclectic assortment of breakbeat, house and techno, both new and classic, skillfully mixed together to create a set that defies the usual genre pigeonholes. With enough meat to satisfy the house-heads, technophiles, and breaks connoisseurs, Tyrant is a dirty romp through dance music; irreverent, bass-heavy and fun."
864,5,"This album is great! every song is full of great lyrics and music.  Some of my personal song favorites are letters, city Life, Little Black Backpack, and Washin and wondering.  All these songs are great, and they never get annoying like those repetitive teen-pop songs.  This is a must-have for everyone who loves alternative/rock music!!!"
865,5,one more of britains great bands that never made it over the pond.this is THE patto album...all you guitar players out there' buy this if only for :loud green song; IT WILL FLOOR YOU!!!! Ollie Halsal was one of those guitar players who died young and never got the recognition he deserved...buy this damn album.. great playing..a great band ''with a wicked sense of humour!!!!
866,4,"Wow.  I've been hearing about MLWTTKK ever since I came over to America, finally broke down and bought this album.  Again, wow.  I don't know how to define these guys, but here's an attempt:  Take Alien Sex Fiend (seemingly the one strongest influence), Propellerheads, Nina Hagen and PHM-era NIN, wrap them up in vinyl and add lots of references to satanism and blood.  That's kind of what this fantastic album sounds like.  It's all over the top, no malice intended, great dancy fun for PVC gatherings.  I'd love to see them in concert.  If you like this, check out Alien Sex Fiend.  Same kind of stuff in an Eighties version."
867,5,"Clean cut recording, tight musicians. With inspiration that seems truly worldwide with it's roots kept in his native Africa, Koko Dembale's Amagni transcends modern Afro Pop and is a cool breeze for my Western Reggae roots. This music always is &quot;there&quot; to sooth out the rough edges away from the stress of hectic city life and makes the trip along boring highways go smooth as silk. I would play this CD for my Grandmother and my 8 year old daughter without reservations."
868,5,I bought this c.d to hear about the nixons before i went to a festival for a local radio stations. I had heard the Nixons song &quot;Sister&quot; on the radio a few years ago and it is one of my favorite songs  but that was all that I had heard from this band. I put the c.d in and was shocked. The first track The One was excellent. There are nothimg but great tracks after that too. After buying this c.d. I probably listen to it more than any other c.d that i own and the nixons are one of my favorite bands. Inspired by this c.d i went out and bought a couple other of their c.d's including Foma which contains &quot;sister&quot; these are great c.ds also but i would definately reccomend that you purchase this one first. Oh and by the way if you get a chance see them live in concert. they were great.
869,5,"As a teenager, my dirty uncle gave a worn-out copy of the &quot;Taking the O Out of Country Show.&quot;  I have since played that tape for hundreds of friends, and I have always wondered what happened to these guys...  If you like clever lyrics, good country music, and gutter humor -- this is for you! This album never ceases to crack me up!  &quot;I've Seen Pubic Hair&quot; is a classic!"
870,5,The diverse and hypnotic sounds of Slowloader are ones that can't be compared to any other band.  Buy it and love it.
871,5,This is a good CD album for those just discovering Richard Wagner. The selections sound very good and there is quite a bit of it. That is important. Do not be fooled by the cover on the CD.
872,5,Another classic for Willie D.
873,5,"That's what Herbert von Karajan had.  On this CD, you get Dvorak's 8th Symphony, Tchaikovsky's 4th Symphony, Bach's Violin Concerto, and opera highlights of Mozart and Bizet.  Truly it is an artist's palette of music.  This compilation, I am sure, aims at showing the true flexibility of Karajan as a conductor.  He was just at home with baroque as he was the ultra romanticism of Tchaikovsky as well, he was the consummate opera conductor.  Although, the opera cast in the recordings on this compilation aren't top notch, the music is what is important, and Karajan delivers."
874,5,"When someone puts all his or her heart into a work, the outcome is always something special. But when you also have talent like Jewel in this case, the result can be breathtaking. Songs like &quot;Foolish Games,&quot; &quot;Who Will Save Your Soul&quot; and most other songs on this CD just touch your heart as they come from the heart. Especially at her age at that time, these songs speak volumes of what moves her emotionally as these songs will also move every listener. The craft of songwriting is very well demonstrated on this excellent album and the sound is fresh and unique to say the least."
875,5,"These two \\""Piano Quartets\\"" are Mozart at his most magnificent.  The team of Ma, Ax, Stern and Laredo, who also brought us classic chamber recordings by Beethoven, Brahms, Faure, and most recently Dvorak, here tackle Mozart with glowing results.  I have to say that while I'm a huge fan of Yo-Yo Ma and Isaac Stern, I can be luke warm about Emanuel Ax .  While I don't dispute his virtuosity, I sometimes have found his playing style cold and uninspiring.  Oh, but not here!  This quartet's playing is wonderfully telepathic, and they make the music jump off the page.  There's even a little improvising going on, and while it may not be of the same volume and nature as the Classic Coltrane Quartet, it is of similar quality.  This Mozart \\""Piano Quartets\\"" is an essential purchase for serious fans, and a great introduction for newcomers."
876,4,"This is a great album that captures a late night atmosphere in a small town, as only John can do.  This is slightly different than his later works, but it's cool to hear John use piano and do some mellow songs, as these became less common later on.  This is pretty raw, but it sounds great.  I would highly recomend this album."
877,5,"Descubierto por Arturo Toscanini, como tantos otros notables (recordar al  menos al gran tenor espa&ntilde;ol Miguel Bienvenido Fleta), el gran tenor  neoyorkino de origen jud&iacute;o Jan Jacob Peerce ser&aacute; uno de los artistas  titulares del Metropolitan Opera House de Nueva York durante los a&ntilde;os  treinta, cuarenta y cincuenta. A pesar de ser una grabaci&oacute;n de los a&ntilde;os  cincuenta, en ella descubrimos a un Peerce en plena forma, con una  capacidad vocal extraordinaria, un fraseo y una dicci&oacute;n imposibles de  comparar, no creo exagerar con esto, con otro cantante del momento.<br />Pero  Peerce no era solamente el gran tenor de los escenarios norteamericanos y  europeos. Era, probablemente junto con Richard Tucker, uno de los  exponentes de un juda&iacute;smo agraviado por los acontecimientos recientes de  entonces al que se le hab&iacute;a dado el don y la gracia para expresar,  cantando, el orgullo de su procedencia hebrea. Una aut&eacute;ntica demostraci&oacute;n  de fuerza interpretativa que es calidad vocal, por supuesto, pero que es  tambi&eacute;n un maravilloso despliegue del caleidoscopio cultural y folkl&oacute;rico  del que, afortunadamente para nosotros, se enorgullec&iacute;a. Es decir,  presentes todos los elementos para hacer de &eacute;ste un registro entra&ntilde;able."
878,5,"THE KAMKARS<br />The Kamkars, a Kurdish family of seven brothers and  a sister, are undeniably one of the leading musical ensembles in Iran  today. Their repertoire ranges from the vast array of Kurdish music with  its poignant, entrancing melodies and uplifting high energy rhythms to the  traditional classical music of Iran. The repertoire of Kurdish music is  richly diverse and deeply-rooted in the ancient history and culture of its  proud and passionate people. It speaks of epic tales and wars, romantic  love, and recounts ancient myths and stories of national and religious  heroes, some of which date back to thousands of years to the time of the  ancient Medes (the ancestors of the Kurds).<br />They are great in concert.  Amazing, a whole family sticking together musically!!!"
879,5,"Being a long time fan of this duo, Summer Breeze is perhaps what got them  started on a great career. While the title track got the most airplay, the  rest of the songs on this album were sadly neglected. Yellow Dirt is one of  my favorites, as well as East of Ginger Trees. The finely crafted harmonies  and Dash Croft's mandolin work woven together with Jim's classical guitar  make for excellent music. Louie Shelton's taseful lead guitar plus the  variety of professional session muscians just make this CD a must for any  collection."
880,5,"This CD totally captures the live sounds of Sublime. Not playing before a stadium sized crowd adds to the fact that Sublime was content with where  they were in the industry. The one thing I want to know is for those people  that have this CD, why doesn't the song list give the name of the song  played directly before &quot;Date Rape&quot;? I know it's off the 40 oz.  CD, and it's only a little cut, but it deserves it's due. Anyway, get this  CD if you are familar with the Sublime studio sound, and would love to hear  them taped live. Even if the sound quality is a little less than par, it's  a great collectiion of Sublime tunes."
881,5,Shorty Swing My Way is Tha best song ever!! It's been my favorite song  since it first came out and I finally bought it!! I will forever love this  song and everybody should have a copy of it!!!! I love My Shorty..Colin!!  Kisses!!
882,5,I saw Solas live in Las Vegas on 8/19/00 and was so impressed with their  music I bought two of their CD's at the concert. This CD has got some of  the best fiddle parts I've ever heard. Winafred is awesome on that fiddle.  Every song on this CD is good but a couple are fast becoming my favorites  of all my music. I found the vocals fantastic along with the instrumentals.  This CD is well worth your time and your money.
883,5,"After every listen, I have to pinch myself, bang my head on a concrete  block, run into a wall and knock myself silly into believing that the music  was created by actual human beings, not perfected technology.  I cannot  find any fault with this album!!  The epic proportions are stupendous.  If  you want to go and buy a live album, the buck stops HERE.        If I had  to be quarantined for the next 100 years, THIS is the album I will take  with me.        I am a collector of their music and I have approximately 25  hours worth of ABB live (69-71 only) and can get a good idea what all other  concert performances by the ABB was like during that era, but they will  never match the legend of the 3/11 - 3/13/71 Fillmore Shows.  Please stop  me from yapping along, there's guys in white coats ready to take me  away........"
884,4,"Have you ever heard an album that has two or three songs that are worth  much much more than the 13.99 alone you paid for the CD and for all you  care the rest of the songs could go by the  way side? This is one of those  albums, One Less Bell to Answer/House without a home, Since I Fell For You,  and Where  You Lead, are more than worth the price of the CD, its 70's  streisand at her strident best, and the duet with herself on  &quot;Home&quot; is divine.  The problem is that there are too many songs  that a fan of 60's Streisand could do without, Mother, Space Captain and  Love just being a few, but those other tracks are bearable in light of the  brilliance of the rest of the album."
885,5,"This set is a fan's dream and anyone else who enjoys great music. I'd  write pages for a review, but to sum it all up just make sure sure you hear  this recording!  Should be in your collection!"
886,5,"Top hats off to Voltaire. Like his first album (The Devil's Bris), this one leaves you wanting more. I've had it for 3 weeks and haven't been able  to put it down. I highly recommend it to anyone with a twisted sense of  humor or just anyone who loves songs about beheadings, fallen angels, lost  loves, or (dare I say it) infatuations with dead girls.. Give it a try,  you'll thank me in the long run."
887,5,"...they're all brilliant. <br />Though am I the only one to notice that this is a completely different record from the 1983 vinyl release? Every song is longer and more fleshed out than the original release (as if it's a  director's cut of a film), so those who have this on vinyl or tape only  from the '80s are in for a surprise with this on disc. Weirdest part is  there's no reference to it being re-mixed, etc. Oh, David."
888,5,"This soundtrack is great!  My girlfriend had it and she thought I would like it.  Being a guitar player, I really appreciated this album.  There are lots of great songs from the movie that sound some what like whats on  Eric Clapton's unplugged CD.  There are lots of other great songs too.   Truely a CD you can pop in and listen the whole way through!"
889,5,"This is simply one of the best turntablist CDs out there.  Cut Chemist  &amp; Shortkut are amazing.  This is a CD that you listen to time after  time and it never gets boring. It reminds me of the &quot;On the Floor of  the Big Beat Boutique&quot; mixes, but better and with more scratching.   Highly recommended."
890,4,It's really good but I don't really like some of the songs but some of her songs are really good like Your Faith In Me or heart Of innocence. I used to like Where You Are but I'm tired of it now so... My Wonderful is really  good too
891,5,It is clear that this guy has tweaked every smallest bit of this cd. If you listen to this album over and over again you discover that all the musical layers blend together perfectly. And the voices are almost all  edited and pitched and who knows what. Even though the really good songs  are at the beginning of the CD it never gets bad though. And I think  Mercury and Solace is the best trance-song ever. It is an amazing cd. I  recommend not being sober when you listen to it. (And I am not talking  about alcohol)
892,5,"SDRE has managed to craft another masterful yet different album. This album is a logical extension of &quot;How It Feels to Be Something On&quot; but unique in its character and composition. The song-writing is top-notch. I have to say on my first listen I wasn't really that impressed - but I decided to give it another chance or two. Then it happened, a hook there, a beautiful melody over there and the spell was cast. The subtleties are just amazing! Combined with the craftmenship of the music - it's really a grand album."
893,3,"Maybe the remixes and new performances would have been better if John Schlit hadn't been so caught up with making this both a hard rock and praise rock both at the same time with his voice (if u can understand what  I'm saying). Most of the original mixes were a lot better. The worst of all  was Dance though. This is still alright if you haven't heard the original  tracks, but I wouldn't recommend buying ti if yuo're looking for a new  better twist on the classics.<br />Also, is it just me? or is Petra making one  too many re-released track albums? When r they finally going to put out an  actual brand new album?"
894,5,"i've been waiting for this release since i bought EP.  j5 has talent beyond any hip hop act that goes beyond the shallow content of violence, sex, and drugs in most of the genre.  they are true musicians who should be  the poster children for the rap industry.  this album will reduce the  jagged edge of most urban music that keeps people from buying in.  give it  a listen, and latch on to the full speed train of hip hop."
895,5,"I cannot possibly recommend this CD more!  The sounds are mesmerizing and haunting, and transport you to another world. I find this CD extremely helpful for meditation, with its soothing and relaxing notes. Highly recommended."
896,5,"Having come to appreciate EC later on in my listening (and his career) I was able to feast upon many albums at once. This one, I find to stand out because it shows that music truly is art. Art, to me, means creating  something unique and at the same time, pleasing.  What's even more  enjoyable is the story about how these guys all got together (story found  in the insert) and to hear music for music's sake. You can hear these guys  just having fun at working. Get it and enjoy another type of classical  rock!"
897,2,"This album is really annoying.<br />The problem is not so much the guitar licks, song selection, or lyrics. The problem for me is the singing, or lack thereof.<br />While many of the songs are clever and interesting, more  often than not Binkley's voice disappears into an inaudible grunt halfway  through a line. In some spots he seems to be hiding his voice behind the  volume of the instruments, too.<br />There's a lounge lizard quality to the  singing a la Bill Murry's skit on the old Saturday Night Live.<br />The  trouble is, in the hands of a capable country/blues singer, the songs would  be serviceable if not really cool. He can play alright, but Nick just can't  croon.<br />The end result is a frustrating experience. On the one hand,  interesting songs and good guitar. On the other, bad vocals and every other  word dropping into a black hole, never to be heard from again in this  universe.<br />If not for the printed lyrics, only some other-dimensional  being on the other side of that black hole could tell what the missing  words are. Maybe they would even consider it an attack from our universe,  given the quality of the singing.<br />Another problem is that the CD is  apparently supposed to be some kind of retrospective, but only two of the  songs were written before 1998-99. So what's up with that?<br />And I'm sorry,  but &quot;Novi Mir&quot; struck me as being very outdated and corny. The  song is basically a call for peace between the US and Russia. I find I can  listen to Sting's &quot;Russians&quot; and still appreciate the Cold War  statement, but this tune is neither topically fresh or (unlike  &quot;Russians&quot;), worth remembering.<br />Sorry, Nick. But the boy in  question should not only NOT be allowed to jam, he should be sent to bed  without supper!"
898,5,"When I listened to this album for the very first time, I was amazed by its sheer beauty. There is absolutely nothing left to be desired on this album. On the whole, it has a nice &quot;retro&quot; sound as if it was recorded  some time in the Sixties. It also has more of a depth than the earlier work  I know (the most recent singles box and their last album) - Belle &amp;  Sebastian have become more mature."
899,4,"With so many young blues players on the scene, I received this CD with some skepticism. I had recently listened to &quot;Call the Cops&quot; which showed a lot of potential but other than that, have heard very little about  this 20 year old guitarist.  To my surprise, Costello's second CD  demonstrates both his creative abilities as well as his appreciation for  the heritage of the blues.  Costello's 3 originals continue the raw and  energetic Chicago style blues demonstarted on his earlier CD.  &quot;Cold,  Cold, Ground&quot; features an uptempo piano based shuffle while  &quot;Who's been Cheatin' Who&quot; is a hard driving number leaning more  towards rock than blues.  The covers on this CD are done well and are very  close copies of the originals.  Most notably, &quot;I want to be loved by  you&quot; and &quot;Close to you&quot; by Muddy Waters. Some blues fans may  yawn at the cover selections and the lack of original interpretation.   Given the potential demonstrated on the 3 originals as well as the earlier  CD, I would have like to see a little more creativity. For that reason, I  deducted one star.  Nevertheless,  this is a good second effort and shows a  promise for future releases."
900,5,A friend lent me this cd and I had to buy it. This cd is a wonderful piece of work. Never before have I heard a cd that I can listen to over and over again in full. I hope these guys reach stardum like Blink182. They deserve  it. Do they have a fan club?
901,4,"I actually heard about Red Flag years ago at UC San Diego, and a couple of my friends told me about them. Their only single i heard was &quot;russian radio&quot;.  funny thing is, i heard the entire album for the first  time..uh... yesterday (yes, i'm late on this one, don't ask why). Anyway,  was expecting more OMD-ish, New Orderish, Anything Box synth stuff, but it  was more Depeche Mode. Love the requisite brit voices, but of course the  music doesnt sound as rich and finished (being more early techno synth),  And i was expecting a lot more catchy hooks and melodies a la the early OMD  (electricity and enola gay). Anyhow, this album is still extremeley  listenable. My favorites on this album are If I Ever (remix) and Russian  Radio (razormaid dub). The rest of the songs are decent and very listenable  but not as catchy. Red Flag also reminded me of early eurodance cut with a  little bit of DM. IMHO, a richer, melodic, and more beautiful synth cd is  Counter Culture's Introspective (also on amazon)."
902,5,ilove all of the sam cooke music on his cd i have enjoyed listing to it day or night.
903,5,"THIS REMIX IS WORTH THE MONEY!  Awesome Remix's of Blaque's&quot;Bring It All To Me.&quot; If you loved the remix for 808, thissophmore remix WILL NOT disappoint!  This is the (GER) import.  Track listings as follows:<br />1)Bring It All To Me - Main Edit ((3:47) This is the video version with just the girls singing.  No N'Synch in hearing range.<br />2)Bring It All To Me - Remix (feat. 50 Cent)(4:10) AWESOME!  A well done remix, TOTALLY different sounding than the LP version.  This is truly a REMIX.  &quot;..dance with me, come and dance with me, romance with me, don't be shy, it's a natural high..&quot; If you love R&amp;B that makes you want to get down, BUY THIS!  Great rap between Blaque and 50 Cent really highlight this remix!<br />3)Bring It All To Me - Remix (feat.  freejazzyglaze) (4:32) - Same infectious groove as the other remix, but with more, and all female rap.  The rap in this is a little harder,(...) You won't want to stop listening to this!<br />4) Bring It All To Me - Remix (Instrumental) END"
904,5,"So this is an Import now?  I'm glad I bought it 10 years ago at one of NY's best record shops for half this price.  Anyway, this is the definitive collection of his Top 10 singles &amp; best album cuts.  Enormously  talented, for many years the release of David Bowie's albums was an event,  you never knew what he'd come out with next, he always kept you guessing.   This is highly recommended."
905,5,"before this album, people had ears, they just did not know how to use them.  all classical music was influenced by HUM via there breakdown of the time continuum during track 2, the pod.  it is true.  the first track,  little dipper, and the fourth, suicide machine, are the best things to come  out of creation since the sixth day (of creation).  if you dont own this  album, you dont own albums.   warning:  takes more than one listen.  i  hated this cd for three months."
906,5,"I fell in love with one of these songs included in a Celtic collection and the album has more than lived up to my high expectations.  The range of musical styles and virtuousity of this musician is staggering.  It's one of  my all-time favorite albums.  The songs are all traditional, but  &quot;tradition&quot; does not equal &quot;stale and lifeless&quot;; Nunez  respects tradition enough to give it new life.  Highly recommended.  I'm  eagerly waiting for more from him."
907,2,"this is not one of dmb's must buys. it lacks energy, and dave doesn't put on a very good vocal performance. many songs on this have been on three or four other albums, and many others just seem to gone on without purpose.  &quot;two step&quot; is my fave dave song, and it really wanders off to  nowheresville on LISTENER SUPPORTED. &quot;crash into me&quot; is very  dissapointing, and so is &quot;#41&quot;. all in all, a descent album, but  not up to the standards of other dave greats such as LIVE AT LUTHER  COLLEGE."
908,4,"a goddess within the music industry whose praises have gone largely unsung for the two-plus decades in which she's been active, angela winbush does not disappoint. an accomplished singer, song-writer and producer, _angela  winbush_ reminds us of all the artists who have influenced her, as well as  those she has influenced. if you listen closely, you will hear shades of  everybody from phyllis hyman to marva hicks. and, on a non-musical note, is  that one fierce cover photo, or what?"
909,3,"CD list above includes titles not on the actual CD ..... no Tubthumping, no I'm a Believer, for example ..."
910,3,"VOICE IS GOOD, BUT, SHE IS NO EMMY-LOU HARRIS AS PROMISED, OR FOR THAT MATTER, DOLLY PARTON.  A LITTLE LESS OF THE &quot;ROCK&quot; FEELING AND A BIT MORE OF THE &quot;REAL&quot; FEELING PLEASE.  CHECK OUT  &quot;TRIO&quot; AND &quot;TRIO II&quot; TO SEE WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT."
911,5,"This cd contains great songs that are more than a cover!  Alan's version of each song is absolutelly good! this cd is one of the best of 99 and I'm looking forward for his next one. Buy this one and I'll assure you won't be  dissapointed, it's pure country music!"
912,3,"Wide Receiver was a popular song in the early 80s. Those familiar with early 80s R&amp;B will love the funky rhythms. Henderson's Wide Receiver might bend a little of the PC folks today, but for people in search of  something away from the everyday fare, get this CD!"
913,4,"Contrary to the disc's subversive title, this is actually the most straightforward release Primus has given us in years. The production really shines here - every note of every instrument is crystal clear, and the end  result is something that sounds more like the work of a concerted group  effort than that of a mad genius. Tom Morello's guitar work is a welcome  bonus, and Tom Waits is always a treat. Perhaps not as adventurous as some  of the Cheeseboys' previous efforts (you decide whether that's a good thing  or not), but this is a solid, rockin' album which, as others here have  noted, often harkens back to the days of Frizzle Fry. Buy it!"
914,5,"Those five stars I gave were only for the original song. The rest of the single is pretty horrible. The Tony Rich Remix totally wrecks the meaning of the song, with his annoying rapping all the way through. The  instrumental Tony Rich remix is a stupid idea. Why couldn't they have had  the instrumental to the original song? The interactive bit is pretty  horrible. It is really slow, and the pictures are really old."
915,4,"40+ reviews on &quot;Forever Changes,&quot; and only one for this is a disservice to the band and the listeners.  The last cut is the only song that is weak, yet even then it was in uncharted waters and leading the way  for other bands.  But the first six tracks are just as powerful and unusual  as &quot;FC.&quot;  &quot;Que Vida!&quot; is just about the most gorgeous  song I can imagine.  And guess where the Stones' &quot;She's a  Rainbow&quot; got its roots?  Love's &quot;She Comes in Colors&quot;  preceded it by a good year and kicks hell out of it.  Take the risk.   Arthur Lee was short-changed, for sure."
916,1,"This is not art, but pure elevater/soap opera type of music. I have heard these songs(unfortunatelY) when I was over an colleagues house and it almost put me to sleep. How can anyone listen to such banel trite stuff?  Music should have some asthetic value, which this rates as a zero in. It is  one of the reasons I don't bother turning on Mtv, VH1, or the radio,  because I don't want to end up completely numb like most of our society."
917,2,"Imagine the Clash:  lead singer's voice, guitar driven songs.  Now imagine Kraftwerk.  The funky, clunky sound effects.  Now, imagine that it's 1999 and for some reason putting these two grandfather bands together makes  sense.  Nothing spectacular, but not a disappointment for the rock genre,  either."
918,5,"this album is a must own for anyone, the guitar work on all the songs are amazing, randy rhoads has to be the best metal guitarist ever, or just best guitarist ever. all the songs are amazing. ozzy's vocals go perfect with  the instrument playing, this album is a must own, buy it now, i promise you  it will not be a waste of your money"
919,2,"WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT, I HAVE ALL OF MARIAH'S CDS, MY FAVORITE BEING BUTTERFLY, BUT WHAT HAPPEND? THIS ALBUM LIKE OTHERS HAVE REVIEWED HERE IS SO WEAK!  I HAD TO LISTEN TO THIS CD, A TOTAL OF FIVE TIMES, TO MAKE  SURE I WAS LISTENING CORRECT. THIS ALBUM HAS SO MUCH FILLER, I ACTUALLY  HAVE TO SKIP THRU THE CD, INSTEAD OF LISTENING TO EVERY SONG, LIKE I HAVE  WITH HER PREVIOUS WORK. HEARTBREAKER WAS OK, BLISS, CRYBABY WITH (SNOOP  DOGG), AND THE EMOTIONAL HONESTY IN PETALS ARE OK, NOT GOOD, BUT ARE OK. IT  SEEMS SHE DID A RUSH JOB DURING THE MAKING OF THIS DISC.I HEARD HER SAY IT  TOOK HER 3 MONTHS TO DO THIS ALBUM, IT SOUNDS MORE LIKE THREE DAYS,  ESPECIALLY THAT SILLY SONG X-GIRLFRIEND, CMON MARIAH, U ARE NOT BRITNEY  SPEARS!  I LOVE MARIAH BUT SHE SHOULD HAVE WORKED A LITTLE HARDER ON THIS  DISC, INSTEAD OF DOING A RUSH JOB, SO PEOPLE COULD BUY THIS FOR THE  CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS."
920,5,"Finally Turner/Rhino has given us a collection worth waiting for. This collection covers Miklos Rozsa's prolific years with MGM. Almost 160  minutes of his film music is represented here in extended suites. Most of  this collection has never been released before. The sound quality is  exellent and often in true stereo sound, taken from the master  recordings.The lavish 48 page booklet is worth the cost of the set itself.  It is difficult to critizise this set, but it does have its down side.  Several of the selections deserve to have thier own, complete, stand alone  release. IVANHOE, KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE, LUST FOR LIFE and KING OF  KINGS particularly. Rhino has choosen to give us excerpts rather than the  complete scores. Only a couple of years ago Rhino/Turner were offering  complete soundtracks for ZABRISKI POINT, POLTERQUIST,BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL,  DARK SHADOWS and others which included every alternate and unused take.  However, for Rozsa we get excerpts. Rhino recently stated that they are in  business to make money and not preserve film music. This philosophy  apparently holds true with this release. Rhino is certainly watching its  purse strings. It would have been wonderful if we could have gotten a 3 of  4 disk set. Still, I grateful that this set is available. It would make a  wonderful addition to any movie lovers library of film music. One thing I  should note, the notes mention that QUO VADIS is not represented because of  the unavailability of suitable source materials,but no mention is made for  JULIUS CAESAR's exclusion."
921,5,"Watch MTV for even a second these days and you're likely to get only kiddie music, and second rate hip hop packaged under beat-you-over-the-head  marketing campaigns.  You only wish the Tribe's masterful rhythms and  rhymes were the rule rather than the exception.  Only Tip and Phife seem  capable of using pop culture references and hip hop machismo to create  lyrics that have a deeper meaning than at first glance.<br />The album takes  you straight in with &quot;Excursions,&quot; which has the best bassline of  maybe any rock or rap song ever recorded.  It lures you through its driving  rhythm and doesn't let up until the disc is over<br />Both rappers have their  best showcase songs on this album: &quot;Butter&quot; for Phife and  &quot;Voices from the Abstract&quot; for Q-Tip.  Both songs are clever and  have rhythms that are irrestible.  <br />And for the all-star song, you can't  beat &quot;Scenario,&quot; which features Busta Rhymes' best rhymes  ever.<br />Check out &quot;Show Business,&quot; &quot;Check the Rhime,&quot;  and everything else.  There's not one bad track, which is a quality no disc  made by a major label in the past two years can boast.  It's a masterpiece."
922,5,"&quot;Like Gods of The Sun&quot; is one, if not my, favorite cd.  The opening song &quot;Like Gods of The Sun&quot; is slow and may not hold interest very well until it kicks in and here comes the double bass drums!   &quot;A Kiss To Remember&quot;  is a very hauntingly beautiful song, and  very deeply emotional.  &quot;For You&quot;  is another deeply emotional  song.  &quot;Here In The Throat&quot;, is a great song filled with angst  and bitterness.  The most hauntingly beautiful tracks on this cd is  &quot;For My Fallen Angel&quot;.  All I can and need to say about this song  is it is one of the most beautiful orchestrated peices i have ever heard.   The guitars on this cd are very much up front and clear.  Everything is  equalized perfectly and you can hear everything clearly.  The Violinist on  this cd brings up very sorrowful emotions and it really gets to you.  If  you like Type O Negative, or anykind of orchestrated dark peices of music,  My Dying Bride is an excellent choice."
923,2,"I haven't heard this (and am therefore echoing AJAY's 2 star review), but want to correct some misinformation.  Jan Akkerman had no involvement with Focus Con Proby.  That was done by Thijs Van Leer's new version of Focus  after the Akkerman / Van Leer split.  Jan's prior works with a vocalist  were primarily his recordings with Kaz Lux (&quot;Eli&quot; is the only one  available here).  Eli is worthwhile! -- The Fly"
924,5,"absolutely, one of the best albums of the year.  i can't describe this album without screaming and cussing because i get so excited about it."
925,5,This is for all of you who  can`t seem to enjoy this album; give it time! You don`t know what your missing!
926,5,The man is unstoppable.  His use of words describe what I am going thru to the exact point.  It's like he's inside my mind singing my life.  Highly recommend a must have single.  Would love to hear a club version though.
927,4,"If you haven't seen the show, then you may not enjoy this recording.  I did see the show, loved it, and enjoy the recording, but my enjoyment is linked to my memories of a fabulous theater experience. A recording only  captures one aspect of the performance, the sound, so it pales in  comparison to the complete experience.<br />Some of the music does stand on  its own, but a lot of it works best in the larger context of the sets,  lighting, costumes, and the physical presence of the performers. Some of  the numbers have minimal value as music, but serve specific theatrical  purposes such as pacing.  For instance, Maureen's performance piece near  the end of the first act makes for a peculiar recording, but it works  beautifully in the theater.  The comedy and audience participation give us  a chance to let off some of the pressure that has been building throughout  the first act, and prepare for what is to come.<br />A few notes to the music  fan in Phoenix...I checked my theater program and it says that Larson died  of an aortic aneurysm, not AIDS. As far as being among the first famous gay  songwriters, I have no knowledge of this man's sexuality, but if he is gay,  he can hardly be among the first. <br />About the show in general, I did not  see it as a show about homosexuality or AIDS any more than La Boheme is a  show about tuberculosis. If that is what you expected, then it's no wonder  you were disappointed.  These issues are merely the backdrop for the more  universal and timeless issues such as living in the present."
928,1,"I originally brought this CD for the single &quot;Last Night,&quot; which I still like.  But the other songs, well, they are just so slow, un-original, and lame.  There is nothing to dance to on the entire CD, and  some of the lyrics could use some work.  I don't recommend purchasing the  CD.  If you're interested in the one good song on the CD, &quot;Last  Night&quot;, try to find the single and save some money."
929,4,"The Comedian Harmonists were a German a capella group who specialised in mimicking instruments with their voices, and did so with such grace and style in the thirties that their cover verions rivalled the originals...at  least in their home market.   Because most of them were Jewish, they fled  to the USA, where five of them provided the voices to the Seven Dwarfs in  Disney's &quot;Snow White&quot;...the remaining two refused to leave (or  returned to) Germany where they met the inevitable fate.    The Kings  Singers recorded this tribute in the seventies (I think) and apparently had  the remaining mebers of the group in tears when they heard it.  If you've  ever heard the Harmonists in their original lo-fi version, this is a must  in hi-fi.  Their version of Tea for Two is impeccable, and the Wochenend  und Sonnenschein is a gem.  Get it if you're a fan of the original."
930,5,"What a CD, what version of this Brahms-evergreen! I have compared this one with the classic version from Stern/Ormandy/Philadelphia Orchestra, which is by all means not a bad recording, of course, but this one here blows the  older one from the socket. Is it Mutter, is it the New York Philharmonic,  is it Masur??? Naturally, it is all of them and much much more. It is the  perfect symbiosis of the philharmonic sound with the virtuoso, an  unprecedented understanding and harmony. Masur and the orchestra appear to  constantly know where Mutter is going, they don't have to follow, they know  where they should be, and that is what sparks the energy, unleashes the  freshness and the easyness which make this recording a not-to-miss Brahms  event."
931,5,"I found this entire disc to be truly a pleasure to listen to. Nik Kershaw's wonderful mix of unique, flowing melodies with driving rhythms stands as one of the best I have heard - ever. Also, I was pleasantly  surprised at the end to hear his remake of &quot;Wouldn't it be Good&quot;  as well. I highly recommend this fresh and novel disc. Well done!"
932,5,"I first heard of Art Farmer on an NPR interview about three months ago.  I am fairly new to Jazz music and of course my favorite artist at this point is Mile Davis.  It may not be fair to compare others to the genius of  Miles, but hey, I'm only human.  However, Art Farmer can blow.  I believe  his style is different than MD and the fact that they play different  instruments is a factor.  I dig his sound.  Very, very smooth.   S. Macias  San Diego, CA."
933,5,"The movie wasn't so great,but the score is about the best you can get.The first track alone makes this CD worth buying.Nothing gets scarier than this!"
934,5,I love this cd and Jordan!! He is so gifted with his talents to Write and Produce.If only the group could get back together though its been years I still listen to the New Kids Like back in the day...
935,5,"Organized Noize has done it again!!!  This entire CD has the brilliance of masterminds.  On the first track the Trombone/Horns Solo will keep you bobbin your head from beginning to end.  But of course, Watch for the Hook  speaks for itself.  Who can resist listening to this track over and over  again. On other tracks with the  background vocals of Deborah Killings,  Sleepy Brown, and Nivea how could Oraganized Noize go wrong.  I would also  like to add Doin' It in the South has that get up and dance all night vibe.   I highly rate this CD 5 stars.  I am overly satisfied.  To whomever, you  need to purchase this CD and enjoy the hits!!!<br />N.S. Jackson"
936,2,"I am an avid Tori fan. I have been collecting her work for years and as of now have 20 of her CDs, many of them imports and singles. Tori's style lies in her great voice and her piano skills, and this single doesn't focus on  either one of those things. She's not a dance club mix artist and I was  disappointed that this album came across as such. Thankfully, the work she  released after this single has been more of the Tori I love, with her voice  and her piano/harpsicord capturing the audience."
937,5,"Don't be fooled by the limited number of tracks on this disc.  Rollins rants on for 76 minutes about Love, Hate, Depression, and the lovely young Fran who got away.  My favorite is I wish Someone Would have Told Me.  We  get to see the early Rollins growing up feeling so different from all of  his peers, and finding out the mystery about woman.  Love him, hate him, He  will always be Rollins, and I think that this is one of his best discs.  Misunderstanding starts off way dark, but finishes up with a great rant  about a punker fan who has an odd way of expressing his love for his  favorite singer!! Enjoy it LOUD!!!"
938,5,"If anyone tells you that this cd is not the bomb, forget them!!!  TLC has come back harder than ever.  Every cut on the CD is worth playing but the best by far is &quot;I'M GOOD AT BEING BAD&quot;, it's the women's anthem  for '99.  It'll probably never be a single so you have to buy the CD to  hear it.<br />Much love to T-Boz, Left-Eye, and Chilli... Next year's grammys  belong to them!!!!"
939,5,This is a must have album for anybody that loves 60's music.  It has a kind of mystical quality about it.  I especially liked &quot;Bang Bang&quot; and &quot;People Get Ready&quot;.  The whole album is great from  beginning to end.  I highly recommend it.
940,5,"I agree with Stein for the most part.  This is indeed a special disc.  In my mind, it is up there with Kind of Blue, Blonde on Blonde, and Nevermind as one of those albums that stop you cold on your tracks and make think,  listen and enjoy.  Get it now!"
941,4,"This recording is not for everyone.  I found that two coworkers absolutely hated it.  There will be few people who take a middle of the road stance on this music.  First, I read about it.  I thought about it, and then I  purchased it and listened again and again.  This recording made me work a  little to find the gems within, and it was every bit worth the effort.    Several reviews compare Elvis' voice to Burts'and I agree.   Bacharach could have used a Warwick or Springfield or even a Luther  Vandross whose rendition of &quot;A House is not a Home&quot; is classic,  but I prefer the coupling of Costello and Bacharach. Costello is  Bacharach's voice as imperfect as that voice may be.  And in Costello's  voice I almost hear my own voice and I experience my personal memories of  lost loves.  I am trying not to overplay it especially when friends are  near because this music must be truly listened to in order to appreciate  it. If you get the uninterrupted  chance to listen to the words and the  emotion behind the words you may find yourself remembering that other girl  and the feeling that pretty girls look right through you when someone else  holds your heart. <br />PS I found Painted From Memory in the Rock section of  Virgin Records under Costello!  It was not located in the jazz, pop or  vocal sections. Can we do something about that?"
942,5,"keiths  voice captured my attention sometime back in 1988. his rich, strong vocals, brought songs like &quot;dont close your eyes&quot; and &quot;im no stranger to the rain&quot; right to the top of my list, and as  loud as I could on my radio. &quot;when you say nothing at all&quot; my  favorite of keiths songs still grabs me. very listenable, and very timely,  these songs stay with you, and as well they should, keith seems to be  singing to us, at least thats the way I like to think. thanks keith.."
943,2,This CD was actually released in 1989 and BMG doesn't tell you that the single disc release in not the complete concert. The complete concert is available as a two disc import from Germany and also available at this  site. The import is worth the money. This release isn't.
944,5,"From the Left Banke to Belle &amp; Sebastian, with Sebadoh and Superdrag detours, Elliott Smith is the man of the month on our stereo.  What Paul Westerberg has not been able to muster on his solo efforts, Elliott Smith  has done so in heaps.  Both XO ans Either/Or are nearly flawless pop  masterpieces.  Great songs all the way around; catchy, melodic and rocking."
945,5,"These are beautiful songs. Ford Econoline is fun. Light Beyond These Woods makes you almost uncomfortable, like you're listening to a private conversation. <br />Great album"
946,5,"I first heard this album in a bar in Greece while heavily intoxicated. It  was being played at ear shattering volume.  I was stunned by the music.  Four years later, stone cold sober, I still think it is one of the best  records ever made.  It is genre defying, but an appreciation of Arab or  Celtic music helps, though I doubt its necessary to really enjoy the  amazing level of artistic creativity and musicianship on display here. Buy  two, and give one to someone else."
947,5,"Here's how I've been touting this CD to my friends: It's as if you took They Might Be Giants, Don Dixon, Squeeze, The Beautiful South and Bo Diddley, put 'em all in a food processer, processed on pulse for a minute or so, pressed the resulting mush into a CD, and tossed it back with a shot of ice-cold Absolut. The best album I have heard in years.  Every track (including the &quot;bonus&quot; tracks) is stand-alone wonderful, and all taken together make me swoon!"
948,4,"JAZZ was recorded during 1978, a tough period for Queen. They were still very popular (&quot;We are the champions&quot; and &quot;We will rock you&quot; were smash hits in 1977, and that year tour just rocked), but were facing the challenge of creating music while punk and new wave were dictating the rules.<br />The result was music as ecletic as Queen's previous works, with some hard rock numbers, ballads and other adventures in the pop-rock area. But this time there was a deliberate effort to sound simpler and less over-produced than before.<br />You won't find any epic songs like &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; or &quot;Innuendo&quot;, or pop anthems llike &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot; or &quot;Radio Gaga&quot;. There are, instead, some good moments and some others that, though listenable ( Queen was such a talented group), lack most of the power and magic that made the band famous world-wide.<br />The order of the songs is awkward. Some rocking moments are separated by soft material,  breaking any climate that could possibly be achieved. One may argue it was characteristic of Queen, but this time things just didn't work well.<br />JAZZ was the last studio album of the band not to include synthetizers. As before, Queen's sound relied more on May's guitar and Mercury's piano, but the support of Taylor and Deacon was competent as usual. The vocal harmonies are sharp, as one might expect, but no operatic extravaganzas this time.<br />About the songs: If you want rock, listen to &quot;Fat Bottomed Girls&quot; (arguably the most sexist lyrics Queen has ever wrote, closer to Aerosmith than their style), &quot;Let me Entertain You&quot; (it should open the album!), &quot;Dead on Time&quot;(May's trademark guitar and cool songwriting shine here) and &quot;All that Jazz&quot;. They proved they really knew how to rock, but avoided the true heavy riffs and instrumentals of previous albuns  that sounded as metallic as they could be.<br />Ballads? Mercury's &quot;Jealousy&quot;, Deacon's &quot;In only seven days&quot; a! nd May's &quot;Leaving Home Ain't Easy&quot;. Careful arrangements, but no great stuff.<br />Curiosities? The slightly arabic &quot;Mustapha&quot;, Taylor's funky &quot;Fun It&quot; (some cool instrumental passages. No way to imagine the band playing it in the first albuns,right?) and &quot;Dreamers Ball&quot; (simple but lovely).<br />The pop singles &quot;Don't Stop Me Now&quot; and &quot;Bycicle Race&quot; are funny but disappointing if one compares to &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; and &quot;Killer Queen&quot;, previous piano driven hits. Anyway ,they have the more direct approach they were looking for.<br />It was a transitional album for the band. If you are a fan, then you should have it. If you prever the heavier, more eccentric albuns of the early seventies or are just looking for the big hits, then  you can do well without JAZZ."
949,5,"Although some critics didn't like this album, I'm sure it's the best. Orzabal showed that he doesn't need Curt by his side, and all the 10 tracks of the album are greats, much more criative  than any other."
950,5,"It's rare to encounter a recording that has it all; well crafted songs, well played and well produced. This is it folks! I haven't heard a CD this good since Peter Gabriel's So of 1986."
951,5,"This CD is absolutely breath taking.  Synthesizers have far since the 70's and Vangelis always manages to make full use of them.  This album is not for the narrow minded or for opponents of New Age....it is simply relaxing, soothing and mellow (precisely as the genre intends).  Voices is an excellent track as well as Echos, and the tracks with Caroline Lavelle, Paul Young and Stina Nordenstam are incredible too.  Reviewers who dont like this artist should stay away-  This CD is a MUST for fans of Vangelis and New Age!"
